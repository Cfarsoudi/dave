               FADE IN:

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Darkness. The sound of battle cries and the clang of metal 
               upon metal. The forest lights up with huge sparks flying 
               from sword and ax as armored knights hack and swing at each 
               other. Mounted knights collide head-on at full gallop, their 
               armor made incandescent in the clash. Sparks eddy in their 
               wakes and float to the ground. The forest catches fire.

               MAIN TITLES on the flames. Out of the sounds of ancient battle 
               grows music, heroic and barbaric, shot through with 
               melancholy.

               Two crazed eyes reflect the fire. The eyes belong to a man 
               without age, at once ancient and boyish, female and male; 
               his eyes are pained from the burden of too much knowledge. 
               So close is he to the flames that a lock of his wild hair 
               sizzles alight. He slaps at the fire as if it were an annoying 
               insect. He wears a cloak of black trimmed with silver. It is 
               Merlin. The wizard weaves a path through the burning forest, 
               dodging the combatants, searching.

                                     MERLIN
                         Lord Uther! Lord Uther!

               The forest around him weeps softly with the sounds that follow 
               slaughter. Patches of undergrowth are smoldering. Small flames 
               lick bark and branches.

               Smoke floats through the trees and hovers over the bodies of 
               the dying and the dead.

               A huge knight reins up beside Merlin on a lathered horse. 
               His armor is blood spattered. He is weary from battle. He 
               looks down at Merlin, his countenance fierce. The blade of 
               his sword glows with an unnatural aura.

                                     MERLIN
                         It's done. A truce. We meet at the 
                         river.

                                     UTHER
                              (disgusted)
                         Talk. Lovers murmuring to each 
                         other...

               EXT. RIVER, FOREST - DAY

               Waiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the 
               forest is a warlord, the Duke of Cornwall. He is flanked by 
               his armored warriors. Lot of Lowthean prominent among them. 
               They are battle-weary and bloodied, but they look ready to 
               fight. Behind them is an army of lesser knights.

               To the opposite bank come Uther and Merlin, a much smaller 
               force of knights, including Uryens, Lord of Gore, surrounding 
               them.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         I spit on your truce, Uther. If you 
                         want peace, throw down your swords.

               Uther and the Duke of Cornwall glare at each other in silence 
               across the river. Uther strains forward, burning with anger; 
               but Merlin restrains him.

                                     UTHER
                         I should butcher all and every one 
                         of them. Merlin, what is this wagging 
                         of tongues?

                                     MERLIN
                         Just show the sword.

               Uther unsheathes his mighty sword, and brandishes it in the 
               air high over his head. The blade hums disquietingly and 
               leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air. The marvel 
               instills dread in all present.

                                     MERLIN
                              (waxing eloquent)
                         Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. 
                         Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, 
                         before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf 
                         to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to 
                         Thor himself and that was when the 
                         world was young and there were more 
                         than seven colors in the rainbow.
                              (and in an aside to 
                              Uther)
                         Speak the words.

                                     UTHER
                              (bellowing)
                         One land, one king! That is my peace!

               The Duke of Cornwall looks around nervously as some of his 
               knights fall to their knees in awe.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         Lord Uther, if I yield to the sword 
                         of power, what will you yield?

                                     UTHER
                         Me, yield!?

               Merlin urges Uther hard.

                                     MERLIN
                              (a whisper)
                         He has given. Now you must.

               The two knights glare at each other, rage contending with 
               anger.

                                     UTHER
                         The land from here to the sea is 
                         yours if you will enforce the King's 
                         will.

               The enemies lock eyes and Merlin watches anxiously.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         Done!

               All men from both sides break out in wild cheers.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         My Lord King Uther, let us feast 
                         together. To my castle. Lord Merlin, 
                         you must join -

               But Merlin is nowhere in sight.

               INT. TINTAGEL CASTLE - HALL - NIGHT

               Drums and wailing flutes fill the banquet hall with a lusty 
               rhythm. Armored warriors watch a lone woman dancing. She is 
               very beautiful, both sensuous and innocent.

               Uther sits at the long table beside the Duke of Cornwall 
               with the barons and dukes of the land, and the lesser knights. 
               The table is stained with wine and littered with bones and 
               half-eaten fruit.

               Uther's eyes burn with lust as he watches the dancer.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                         I would wish you such a wife, Lord 
                         Uther, as my Igrayne. So innocent, 
                         but in bed, a furnace...

               The Duke rises and goes to his wife, be-striding the center 
               of the hall and Igrayne weaves circles of dance around him. 
               He gloats with pride.

               The words escape his lips:

                                     UTHER
                         I must have her.

               Lot spins to face him.

                                     LOT
                         What? You're mad! What about the 
                         alliance?

                                     UTHER
                              (oblivious)
                         I must have her.

                                     LOT
                         And risk all you've won? This castle 
                         commands the sea gate to the kingdom.

               Uther is not one for politics, and Lot's words sail past 
               him. The King lusts for Igrayne.

               A bell is struck not far away. The music ceases and the hall 
               falls silent. The great door creaks open, revealing the dawn 
               light, and a monk steps into the hall and waits by it. Muffled 
               by corridors of stone, a choir of monks can now be heard 
               singing the high, ecstatic harmonies of the Te Deum. Those 
               who have fallen asleep at the table are roused, those drunk, 
               helped up.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN

               The monk leads the party down the hallway of the castle. 
               Thin shafts of dawnlight filter through archers' slits in 
               the thick walls onto stone floors. Otherwise, it is dark. 
               Each person, lady and knight, proceeds alone, head bent, 
               some crossing themselves.

               Uther is among them. He stops in a dark alcove, breathing 
               heavily, waiting.

               As the lovely Igrayne drifts past him, he pulls her out of 
               sight of the others.

               In a shaft of pale light Uther clasps Igrayne to his 
               breastplate, his iron arm wrapped around her frail body. So 
               violent is his embrace that she cannot breathe, her mouth is 
               wide with fear, and her feet do not touch the ground; an 
               impaled butterfly.

                                     UTHER
                         You will be mine. Wife and queen, 
                         bed and crown.

               His face is close to hers, looking as though he would devour 
               her tender whiteness with his kiss. She doesn't answer; she 
               can't. Even Uther understands this and lets her go.

                                     IGRAYNE
                              (a fierce whisper)
                         I want no other crown and no other 
                         bed than those I have.

               Her gown and her fragile skin torn on the spikes of his armor, 
               Igrayne backs away and joins the procession.

               Uther trembles with unreleased passion.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN

               Igrayne enters the candlelit chapel from which issues the 
               chant, calling the castle to worship. She rushes to her 
               husband's side, kneeling next to him and whispering. The 
               Duke of Cornwall looks back at Uther, hatred in his eyes.

               EXT. WAR CAMP - BEFORE TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAY

               Uther is in a towering rage. Sword drawn, he stalks among 
               the biers of fallen knights. Squires and clerics keep a 
               healthy distance. The sky is lowering, pregnant with rolling 
               thunder. Beyond his encampment, high on a cliff rising out 
               of the sea stands the impregnable Tintagel Castle, seat of 
               the Duke of Cornwall, now under siege.

                                     UTHER
                              (bellowing in all 
                              directions)
                         Merlin! Where are you!?

               Just then a knight rides up and dismounts. It is Ulfius, a 
               lieutenant.

                                     UTHER
                         Have you found him?

                                     ULFIUS
                         No--

               But he cannot finish. He is taken aback by the sudden 
               appearance of a hideous hag who approaches, rattling a 
               beggar's pan.

                                     HAG
                         What a hurry you were in this morning, 
                         good sir. You forgot to give this 
                         old woman a coin.

                                     ULFIUS
                         I saw you half a day's gallop from 
                         here. I asked you if you had seen 
                         Merlin. I returned here straight 
                         away. How did -

                                     HAG
                         --I heard. I have come. I am also 
                         Merlin.

               The figure straightens, the filthy rags become a flowing 
               cape, and the hair is swept back by the wind, andóit is 
               Merlin, laughing.

                                     MERLIN
                         I have walked my way since the 
                         beginning of time. Sometimes I give, 
                         sometimes I take. It is mine to know 
                         which, and when.

                                     UTHER
                              (exploding)
                         Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.

               Ulfius edges away.

                                     MERLIN
                         I know the storm inside you, and 
                         what it has wrought. The alliance I 
                         forged is wrecked.

               The Duke of Cornwall under siege. All this for lust. Selfish 
               lust.

               Uther grabs Merlin.

                                     UTHER
                         For Igrayne. One night with her. Do 
                         it. Use the magic.

               Merlin frowns pensively, his gaze searching strange distances 
               and wandering; then focusing, blazing straight at Uther.

                                     MERLIN
                         You will swear by your true kingship 
                         to grant me what I wish. Then you 
                         shall have it.

               Uther kneels and draws his sword and holds it up by the blade, 
               a cross.

                                     UTHER
                         I swear it. By Excalibur and the 
                         holy--

                                     MERLIN
                         --What issues from your lust will be 
                         mine. Swear it again.

                                     UTHER
                         I swear it.

               Merlin looks down sorrowfully at the kneeling King.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, TINTAGEL CASTLE - EVENING

               The Duke of Cornwall watches a force of armored knights riding 
               forth from Uther's war camp, with banners flying. It passes 
               beneath the castle and on toward a distant cliff.

                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL
                              (to a lieutenant)
                         It's Uther and all his best knights. 
                         He leaves behind little more than 
                         fledglings to guard his camp.

               His eyes are as cold and as pale as ice.

               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - TWILIGHT

               Uther and his knights, and Merlin on a mule, ride to the 
               high promontory and dismount. Here, overlooking the sea, is 
               a circle of ancient stones, carved with strange runes and 
               hieroglyphics, and as the wind moves through them it moans 
               and sighs.

               The knights watch as Merlin and Uther, leading his horse, 
               walk toward the stones. Merlin strides into the circle, 
               turning to look at Uther, who hesitates.

                                     MERLIN
                         Come.

               Uther starts to make the sign of the cross, but Merlin halts 
               him with a gesture. Uther's hand drops, and he enters the 
               circle with his horse.

               Merlin and Uther look out across the sea, to Tintagel Castle 
               high upon the cliff.

               Merlin solemnly raises his arms toward that distant castle, 
               and chants in an ancient language, the sounds of which he 
               marries to the roaring and whining of the wind. The wind 
               becomes stronger, and Merlin's incantations become more 
               intense, and the wind in turn becomes wilder still. Until 
               Merlin is charged with a fierce, nonhuman power, as the wind 
               buffets his slight frame.

               And then, for all to understand:

                                     MERLIN
                         I hold the balance of all things in 
                         my summoning. Arise mists. Come fog.

               EXT. VISTA FROM THE CLIFF - TINTAGLE CASTLE - TWILIGHT

               From the horizon a front of fog advances toward the castle 
               to envelop it, and continues across the gulf to the circle 
               of stones.

               EXT. GATE, TINTAGLE CASTLE - TWILIGHT

               The portal opens and a small force of armored men, led by 
               the Duke of Cornwall, exits. A fog is thickening all around 
               them.

               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - TWILIGHT

               The advancing front envelops Merlin and Uther, eddying around 
               the stones.  All else is obliterated.

                                     MERLIN
                         Mount your horse.

               The King does.

                                     MERLIN
                         Ride straight to the castle, across 
                         the sea of fog.

               Uther spurs straight for the edge of the cliff, then reins 
               in his horse abruptly.

                                     UTHER
                         But the cliff, the sea...

               Merlin rages, crazed.

                                     MERLIN
                         Ride across! Across the bridges of 
                         desire. Your lust will hold you up. 
                         For I have just woven it into the 
                         fabric of the world. This is magic - 
                         making solid what is in the mind, 
                         and unsolid, that which is already 
                         solid.

               He gives the horse a stinging blow with his staff.

               The horse and Uther charge forward into a gallop and stepping 
               off where the hidden edge of the cliff would be, hoofbeats 
               ceasing and the horse dropping for the blink of an eye, they 
               gallop across the fog.

               EXT. MERLIN'S FOG

               Galloping on no visible terrain, Uther and his horse advance 
               through the restless fog, and as they recede rider and animal 
               become a wavering, changeable form within the cloud.

               EXT. GATE, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               Horse and rider pull up at the gate.

                                     RIDER
                              (calling)
                         Wake up in there. It is I.

               If it was not for the electric blue hue burning in the eyes 
               of the man entering the castle, the same magic hue that 
               Excalibur left upon the air when wielded, the resemblance to 
               the Duke if Cornwall would be perfect.

               After a moment the portal opens.

               INT. INNER GATE, INTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               He passes into an inner court, the portal closing behind. 
               Armed men emerge cautiously. Thinking that it is their Duke 
               they help him dismount.

                                     'DUKE' OF CORNWALL
                         Have the horse ready. I ride out 
                         before sunrise.

               An inner gate opens and the 'Duke' goes through it.

               EXT. UTHER'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               The real Duke and his men ride through the fogbound camp, 
               cutting the ropes of the tents, stabbing the men trapped 
               beneath the canvas. When a frightened crow flies squawking 
               into the face of the Duke's horse, which rears. He is unhorsed 
               and falls, and impales himself on a tent stake.

               Dying, the true Lord of Tintagel Castle rises and staggers 
               forward, blood pumping from him.

               INT. CHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               A little girl of four awakens from a nightmare, a small lone 
               figure in her canopied bed. Her eyes are ice, like her 
               father's.

                                     MORGANA
                         Papa... Papa...

               Igrayne is soon at her side, lifting the child from the bed, 
               holding her tight.

                                     MORGANA
                         My father is dead...

               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               The 'Duke' enters. The room is empty, but the door to 
               Morgana's room is open.

               INT. MORGANA'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The 'Duke' stands in the doorway. Igrayne herself is 
               surprised.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         Look, here is your father. It was 
                         just a dream, little one.

                                     'DUKE' OF CORNWALL
                         Come Igrayne.

               Igrayne kisses Morgana, tucks her in and returns to her own 
               room, closing the door. The child doesn't know whether to 
               believe the truth of the dream or the waking truth.

               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               In full armor, the 'Duke' bears down on the naked Igrayne on 
               her marriage bed. She stares at him, wondering. But his eyes 
               are closed, and finally he carries her in his wild passion, 
               her white limbs tangling around the lustre of his armor.

               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - NIGHT

               And Merlin is jolted awake from deep within himself, coming 
               out of a trance.

                                     MERLIN
                         It is done. The future has found 
                         root in the present.

               He lifts himself up on his staff. He stands in the midst of 
               the ancient stones, bristling with excitement. Uther's mighty 
               knights are asleep, a deep unnatural sleep, huddled together 
               and surrounded by their horses. And then Merlin swoons, 
               collapsing to the ground.

               INT. HALL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN

               His lieutenants deposit the Duke of Cornwall's bloodless 
               body upon the long table. His eyes are wide open, icy and 
               cunning even in death. The ladies of the castle support and 
               comfort the grief-stricken Igrayne as she approaches the 
               body of her husband. Morgana hangs onto her mother's gown.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         When did it happen? Where?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         In the camp of Uther, my lady, just 
                         after nightfall.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         It can't be. He came to me, to his 
                         bed, last night.

                                     LADY
                         It was his spirit, yearning for you 
                         in his hour of death, that visited 
                         you.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         His spirit?

               Pale with grief, Igrayne stares at her dead husband in 
               silence.

               Then her hand drifts to her stomach. When she talks again, 
               undone and resolved, it is to all and herself:

                                     IGRAYNE
                         Tintagel Castle falls to Uther. But 
                         what shall become of me, and the 
                         child I bear?

               Morgana shows no distress. She runs her baby hands across 
               her father's face and closes his eyes. The intensity that 
               was frozen in them is now added to her own pale and cunning 
               eyes.

               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - DAY

               Merlin has been propped up against one of the stones. He is 
               in a deep trance and Uther is attempting to shake him awake.

                                     UTHER
                         I want her, Merlin. I cannot be 
                         without her. Tintagel is mine. Can I 
                         take her now? Tell me!

               Merlin's eyes open but he sees nothing, and only a puzzling 
               squeal issues from him.

               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE- EVENING

               Morgana watches from a corner. The ladies of the castle 
               surround Igrayne who is giving birth.

               Noisy crows alight on the windowsill. Only Morgana notices.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               Uther strides to Igrayne's bedchamber, his warrior knights 
               following. He is dirty and his iron dress is blood-spattered.

                                     UTHER
                              (bellowing)
                         Three horses died under me, so hard 
                         did I spur them here. Is it born? Is 
                         it alive?

               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               At his approach and entrance the ladies shrink back, and 
               Morgana edges closer to her mother, and seats herself on the 
               bed beside her. Ingrain holds her newborn baby in her arms, 
               the blood of birth still wet upon it.

                                     UTHER
                         Out!

               The ladies slip past him to the door, and he goes up to 
               Igrayne.

                                     UTHER
                         What is it, lady?

               Terrified of him, Igrayne faces him the best she can.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         A boy, sir. Rest yourself.

               Uther waves away her words but does sit down on the bed, 
               exhausted. He notices Morgana, who stares at him.

                                     UTHER
                         Send the girl away.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         She is just a child -

                                     UTHER
                         Out!

               Igrayne draws the child to her and kisses her cheek.

                                     IGRAYNE
                              (whispering)
                         Go now. Come back later.

               The child leaves silently, hatred in her eyes.

                                     UTHER
                         She watches me with her father's 
                         eyes.

               He grasps the newborn baby with his iron hand, and pulls it 
               to himself. He looks upon it with wonder, with a gentleness 
               that is unexpected.

                                     UTHER
                         Igrayne, is he mine, or -

               He can't bring himself to say his name. She hesitates on the 
               edge of tears, worried for the infant lying in its iron 
               cradle.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         The night he died, a man loved me 
                         with great fierceness. He looked 
                         like my husband, spoke like, smelled 
                         like, felt like my own husband. But 
                         it was not he, for he was already 
                         dead. It wasn't his spirit, for this 
                         child, who was conceived that night, 
                         is flesh and blood. I know nothing 
                         more.

               Uther draws a dagger. He lifts it.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         No--

               But he uses it before Igrayne can move. He severs the leather 
               thongs that bind the iron breastplate to his chest. He casts 
               it to the floor. His chest is smooth and milk-white in 
               striking contrast to his creased, weathered face. And beaming, 
               he holds the baby to it.

                                     UTHER
                         Through him, I will learn to love 
                         them, for I am tired of battle. I 
                         will stay by his side and
                              (looking shyly at 
                              Igrayne)
                         his mother's...

               Igrayne's hatred for the man is at the very edge of becoming 
               love. The baby starts to cry.

                                     UTHER
                         Here. It's hungry.

               And his free hand opens her shift, and he holds a swollen 
               breast in his gloved hand, squeezing gently. Milk bubbles 
               from it and he thrusts the baby's mouth onto it.

               Igrayne weeps and Uther watches proudly as the baby suckles.

               Merlin advances from the window, his cape the same iridescent 
               green-black as the feathers of the crows that were perched 
               by the window.

                                     UTHER
                         Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at 
                         last.

                                     MERLIN
                         Doing what I did for you, it wasn't 
                         easy, you know. It takes it's toll. 
                         It took nine moons to get back my 
                         strength.

               Uther avoids looking at him.

                                     MERLIN
                         Now you must pay me.

                                     UTHER
                         I?

                                     MERLIN
                         The child is mine, Uther. I have 
                         come for him.

               Uther is shaken to his roots. Igrayne watches, trying to 
               understand.

                                     UTHER
                         The oath. You didn't say--

                                     MERLIN
                         You didn't ask!

                                     IGRAYNE
                         Uther, is it true? Don't let him 
                         take the child.

                                     UTHER
                         I swore an oath, Igrayne. I made a 
                         pact with Merlin.

               Igrayne suddenly understands. She glares at Uther.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         It was you? You came to me that night. 
                         You are the father.

               Uther is caught, and turns to Merlin who is harsh and 
               unswaying.

                                     MERLIN
                         It's not for you, Uther, hearth and 
                         home, wife and child.

                                     UTHER
                         To kill and be king, is that all?

                                     MERLIN
                         Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought 
                         once that you were the one to unite 
                         the land under one sword. But it'll 
                         take another, a greater king...

                                     UTHER
                         You strike me with words as hard as 
                         steel.

                                     MERLIN
                         They are not weapons, my friend, but 
                         truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole 
                         his wife and took his castle, now no 
                         one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your 
                         allies will turn against you. Give 
                         me the child, Uther, I will protect 
                         him. Go back to your war tent.

               Uther wrenches the baby from it's mother's breast and hands 
               him to Merlin.

                                     UTHER
                              (in torment)
                         By the oath, take the devil child. 
                         Take him!

               With the bawling baby under his cape, Merlin exits. Igrayne 
               pulls herself out of the bed, weak, her legs giving under 
               her. She starts after Merlin.

                                     IGRAYNE
                         WHY?... Why must he have the baby?

               Uther stops her with his bulk and she claws savagely at his 
               chest to get past him. He weeps as he folds his arms around 
               her.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               As Merlin walks through the castle, the baby crying in his 
               arms, the knights and ladies step back, afraid to intervene 
               in royal matters.

               INT. HALL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT.

               Merlin comes across the empty banquet hall, cooing to the 
               baby, strangely pacifying him. Morgana steps out of the 
               shadows in his path, and Merlin stops at the sight of the 
               little girl, her pale eyes glaring at him.

               She speaks haltingly and clearly while far-off Igrayne cries 
               out her distress.

                                     MORGANA
                         Merlin, are you now the father, and 
                         the mother, of the baby?

               Staring at her, Merlin shudders and without answering he 
               continues away, faster now, and into an unlit passageway, 
               disappearing from sight a bit sooner than an ordinary mortal 
               would have.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               The forest is dark and shiny with rain. An unseen battle 
               rages.

               The first combatant in sight is Uther, who swings the mighty 
               Excalibur, cutting an attacker in half at the waist. Uther 
               and a small force of knights, Ulfius among them, are 
               retreating through the slippery wet forest, completely 
               outnumbered.

               Lord Lot of Lowthean and Lord Uryens of Gore are the leaders 
               of the attack.

                                     URYENS
                              (to his men)
                         The King's sword. I must have it.

               Ulfius and his men stand their ground so the King may escape 
               the onslaught. They are hacked down.

               Uther flees alone, severing the limbs of any man and tree 
               that stands in his way.

               EXT. STONE IN THE FOREST - DAY

               Uther has gained on his pursuers. He comes to a small clearing 
               where the spine of a buried boulder rises through the forest 
               floor. He stops upon it, breathing hard, dripping blood. He 
               rages aloud, but his throat is raw and cracked and only a 
               whisper comes out.

                                     UTHER
                         Merlin, where are you? To weave a 
                         mist, to hide us...

               He hears his pursuers closing in.

                                     UTHER
                         No one shall have the sword. No one 
                         shall wield Excalibur but me.

               He holds it by the hilt with both hands, the blade pointing 
               to the ground of stone. He flexes his knees. He lifts up his 
               hands above his head. And with all the strength that rage 
               and pain can muster, and more, he drives the blade of 
               Excalibur into the stone, nearly to the hilt. His mouth widens 
               in an awful silent scream, and then the foam of saliva pink 
               with blood issues from deep within him, so violent was his 
               effort.

               As the sword cuts into the rock, the earth shudders.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               The forest quakes. The knights searching for Uther halt in 
               fear.

               EXT. FIELDS, WOODS - DAY

               And far away, a caped figure is crossing a field toward a 
               wood, when the earth shakes, stirring animals and birds. The 
               man turns. He is Merlin, the two day-old baby peeking from 
               his cape. Merlin is amazed at the phenomenon, he puts his 
               ear to a rock protruding from the earth.

                                     MERLIN
                         Into the spine of the dragon!
                              (and then he is 
                              saddened)
                         Uther... I loved you, mighty child.

               And tears welling, and giggling at the same time, he whisks 
               away into the woods.

               EXT. STONE IN THE FOREST - DAY

               Uther staggers away, colliding with trees, staggering, 
               crashing to the ground. Until the only life left in him is 
               the coursing of his blood, flowing from his gaping mouth 
               onto the leaves on the forest floor.

               The enemy knights advance through the trees. They prod at 
               the fallen leviathan, they roll him over to get at his 
               scabbard. Only then do they see the sword in the stone, and 
               they stop, amazed and afraid. Their captains appear. Uryens 
               sees what they are staring at, and races to the sword and 
               attempts to pull it out.

               He strains with all his might, but it is immovable.

                                     LOT
                         Let me.

               He shoves Uryens aside, but he can't loosen the sword either, 
               and he rages with frustration.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               LEGEND APPEARS:

               "Fifteen years passed and the land was without a king."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. FIELDS - DAY

               Peasants spill over the crest of a hill. They are fleeing a 
               force of armored knights, their plumed helmets forged in the 
               semblance of predatory animals. The knights thunder past the 
               peasants, trampling the ripening crops. Sir Uryens is their 
               leader, his hard face indifferent to the havoc he leaves in 
               his wake.

               The peasants watch in mute anger.

               EXT. FARMYARD - EVENING

               Sir Lot leading another group of mounted knights comes 
               galloping into a small hamlet, panicked chickens and pigs 
               scattering at their approach. The farmers run for their lives 
               as the steel men dismount, leading their horses to water and 
               hay, and searching for vittles. A knight spots a woman who 
               stands frozen with fear, and he drags her into the barn as 
               her crying child watches.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

               A farmhouse is burning nearby, and three mounted figures 
               make their way along a trail at a walking pace - an old knight 
               in leather and mail, a young knight proud in gleaming new 
               armor; and on a farm horse, a squire with baggage and jousting 
               lance. The old knight, Sir Ector, is troubled by what he 
               sees.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         It is a dark hour... everywhere 
                         lawlessness and destruction, and no 
                         one to lead us out of it.

               Just then, ten crazed peasants emerge from the darkness, 
               hurling stones and armed with clubs and pronged sticks. They 
               surround the three riders. Sir Ector wheels around and slices 
               the air with his sword to ward off the ambushers.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Listen all. I am Sir Ector of Morven 
                         and these are my sons. You would 
                         wrong me, for I have never stolen 
                         from others, or destroyed the fruit 
                         of the land.

               The peasants edge closer, working up the nerve to rush the 
               horsemen. The sound of thundering hooves cuts through the 
               clamor.

               A cavalcade of riders, armor gleaming in the moonlight, 
               advances across the fields at a gallop. Immediately the 
               peasants scatter. The old knight is on the verge of tears.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         The people's anger is just. It is 
                         sad that for our own safety, we will 
                         have to ride to the tournament with 
                         these robber knights.

               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - SUNRISE

               Red with the first light of day, Excalibur rests in the stone 
               as King Uther left it. The field is itched with tents, each 
               flying its heraldic banner. Knights and squires are 
               everywhere, preparing horses and armor for the joust. A burly 
               man in religious robes harangues the crowd, vying for 
               attention.

                                     BISHOP
                         This is Easter day, when Christ rose 
                         again. Who will find strength in 
                         victory of arms? Who will draw the 
                         sword?

               The Bishop goes among the tents, through the teeming throng, 
               solemnly casting holy water upon man and horse, armor and 
               banner. The knights kneel at the Bishop's transit, but 
               ceremony does not lift the air of grimness that lies over 
               the event.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND, SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               Their armor ablaze with sunlight, two mounted knights thunder 
               toward each other at full gallop, lowering their long jousting 
               lances. As they meet, the lance of each knight is deflected 
               by the shield of the other. A gasp goes through the crowd, 
               and the two knights charge past each other. They wheel around 
               at the end of the jousting ground and go at each other again 
               from the other direction. Again lances strike, and this time 
               one of the men is hit in the chest and violently unhorsed. 
               The crowd cheers.

               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               The victor, Leondegrance, rides up to the stone and dismounts. 
               Each great knight with his coterie of lesser knights comes 
               to watch. A charge of expectation is in the air, although 
               most knights are glowering with envy.

               Leondegrance of Camelyarde ascends to the sword, grabs it by 
               the hilt, and begins to tug with all his might. Excalibur is 
               immovable. The moment of tension passes. Leondegrance staggers 
               toward his waiting squires, who lead him away. All the others 
               return to the battle sport.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               At the edge of the jousting ground Sir Ector's son Sir Kay 
               is getting ready for a bout. His brother Arthur is buckling 
               the new armor while his father fusses about him, making small 
               adjustments when he notices that Kay's scabbard is empty. He 
               turns to Arthur and grab's him by the ear.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Arthur, where is Kay's sword? A good 
                         squire doesn't forget his knight's 
                         sword.

               The fifteen year-old boy blushes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I left it in the tent, sir.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Well hurry then, and get it.

               The boy dashes off as Sir Ector shakes his head, not without 
               affection beneath the sternness.

               EXT. TENTS - DAY

               Arthur runs in search of their tent. He finds it.

               INT. TENT - DAY

               He enters. The saddle trunk has been emptied on the floor, 
               equipment is scattered all over. Arthur is shocked, 
               nonetheless he rummages madly. Finally he stops, on the verge 
               of tears.

                                     ARTHUR
                         It's been stolen....

               EXT. TENTS - DAY

               He comes out, utterly defeated, and frantic. He stops by two 
               knights who are arguing angrily; and one of them has left 
               his sword in the grass.

               Arthur looks at it. He is tempted to steal it, but he can't. 
               Head down, he wanders off.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               Sir Ector and Sir Kay are waiting.

                                     SIR KAY
                         Father, I'll go and see what's keeping 
                         him.

               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               Arthur stops at the edge of the dark forest, totally dejected, 
               when he sees the sword in the stone. He walks up to it, his 
               face lighting up, brimming with innocence. He is alone, as 
               everyone has returned to the jousting ground.

                                     ARTHUR
                         If only Kay could have it...

               He smiles, forgetting his troubles, a boy again living in a 
               fairy tale. He grasps the sword by the hilt and it comes 
               away easily from its stone lock.

               Not expecting it to, he nearly falls. He stares at it, 
               terribly excited and surprised: he tucks it under his arm 
               and rushes back.

               EXT. TENTS - DAY

               He bumps into Kay.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (breathless)
                         Your sword was stolen, Kay, but here 
                         is Excalibur. Is it too late? I 
                         hurried--

               Kay takes it. He cannot believe what he's holding in his 
               hands. He starts to talk but he is so agitated he can only 
               stutter.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               Kay, with Arthur in tow, rushes to Sir Ector and shows him 
               the sword; he trembles with excitement.

                                     SIR KAY
                         Look, Father. Excalibur. Does that 
                         mean that I am to be king?

               Sir Ector is dumbstruck.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Did you free the sword, boy?

                                     SIR KAY
                         I... did, Father.

               Ector looks at his son amazed, wanting to believe but not 
               able to.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         We must go to the stone at once.

               With Excalibur in hand Ector of Morven heads for the stone, 
               Kay following, and Arthur too, the boy flushed with excitement 
               but a little worried, not understanding what is happening.

               The exchange between Sir Ector and Sir Kay has been overheard. 
               Some have seen the sword in Sir Ector's hand. Rumor spreads 
               like wildfire.

               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               As Sir Ector ascends the stone, from all parts of the jousting 
               ground knights and squires, the Bishop and the clerics, and 
               peasants too, press around.

               Ector lowers the blade into the tight cleft and Excalibur 
               sinks to its original position.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Draw it, son!

               Sir Kay grabs the hilt and pulls without conviction, and the 
               sword doesn't give. Eyes downcast, he lets go.

                                     SIR KAY
                         Sir, I didn't draw the sword. Arthur 
                         gave it to me.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Arthur ?!
                              (spinning around to 
                              face him)
                         How did you get the sword, child?

                                     ARTHUR
                              (frightened)
                         Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was 
                         stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I 
                         took it.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         You freed it, son?

                                     ARTHUR
                         I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.

               He starts to kneel but Ector pulls him up.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Try the sword, Arthur.

               Arthur is about to grasp the hilt when Uryens and Lot, and 
               other nobles, Leondegrance of Camelyarde, and Sir Caradoc 
               and Sir Turquine among the younger, stride up.

                                     URYENS
                         Stand back, Sir Ector, and take your 
                         children.

                                     LOT
                         We will try again.

               Uryens, Lot, Leondegrance, Caradoc, Turquine - each in turn 
               grapples with the sword, only to be defeated by its 
               immobility. The crowd around the stone is thickening with 
               common folk.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Let the boy try the sword.

                                     BISHOP
                         Let the boy try...

               The demand is echoed by peasants and serfs. The great knights 
               remain silent and bitter in their defeat. Sir Ector pushes 
               Arthur to the sword.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         Go ahead, boy. Don't be afraid.

               The boy hesitates shyly, and then takes the hilt of Excalibur 
               and pulls out the sword with a great sweep.

               The throng is stunned. Silence falls. Some kneel, following 
               the example of Sir Ector and Sir Kay, of the Bishop and 
               Leondegrance. The other nobles stay back, confused, afraid, 
               angered.

               Arthur stands there, little more than a boy, his cheeks 
               flushed, his soft hair ruffled by the wind, his eyes shining 
               with exultation, awe, and fear. Then, as if gaining confidence 
               from the sword itself, he turns it in arcs above his head.

                                     BISHOP
                         We have our King, thanks be to God.

               The commoners and some of the knights react with roaring 
               enthusiasm. The others draw closer to Uryens and Lot and 
               their supporters, closing ranks around them.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Please, Father, rise up. I was your 
                         son before I became your King... if 
                         I am King.

               Sir Ector rises, tears streaming down his cheeks.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         My Lord, you are King, all the more 
                         because you are not my son, and I am 
                         not your father.

               This is quite a shock to the boy king, and to the onlookers.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Who is, then?

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         I don't know. Merlin brought you to 
                         me when you were newly born and 
                         charged me to raise you as my own. 
                         At first, I did so because I feared 
                         Merlin, later because I loved you.

               Merlin's name is on the lips of all those close by.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Who is Merlin?

                                     MERLIN
                         Speak of the devil!...

               From out of the forest strides Merlin, dramatic, cape flowing, 
               eyes crazed as ever, laughing at his own entrance. A crow is 
               perched on his shoulder, and it squawks loudly. Annoyed with 
               it, Merlin swooshes it away.

                                     MERLIN
                         I am Merlin. Counselor to kings. 
                         Wizard and beggar. Prophet and...
                              (he drops it)
                         I have feasted on thunderbolts, I 
                         savored my death before I got myself 
                         born. I--

               Merlin interrupts himself when his eyes fall on the boy, who 
               is taking in his performance raptly, half awestruck, half 
               amused.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Whose son am I?

                                     MERLIN
                         You are the son of King Uther, and 
                         the fair Igrayne... you are King 
                         Arthur.

               The suspicion and confusion and envy of the lords erupts.

                                     LOT
                         Merlin, we haven't forgotten you. 
                         This is more of your trickery.

                                     URYENS
                         You're trying to foist a boy of 
                         dubious birth upon us. You want to 
                         shame us?

                                     LOT
                         Lord Leondegrance, join us against 
                         the boy. Surely you can see he is 
                         only Merlin's tool.

                                     LEONDEGRANCE
                         No. I, Leondegrance, Lord of 
                         Camelyarde, saw the drawing of Uther's 
                         sword, and witnessed no trickery. If 
                         a boy has been chosen, a boy shall 
                         be king.

               The crowd of serfs and peasants cheer wildly, and their long 
               suppressed anger against the nobles comes to the fore. They 
               dare to press up against them, fists hammering on their 
               shields as the chant Arthur King over and over. Dark and 
               scowling, full of rebellion, all the lords except Leondegrance 
               begin to withdraw their iron men surrounding them.

               EXT. CHAPEL, JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               Bells toll the good news. People stream by to see the new 
               king and join the celebration.

               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               Uryens and Lot, and Caradoc, Turquine, and the other lords 
               have mounted, and are moving out, when from the rear guard a 
               bowman in Lot's service draws upon the unarmored figure of 
               Arthur across the cheering crowd. The bowman lets the arrow 
               fly.

               It flies over the heads of the crowd, unseen.

               Except by Merlin at Arthur's side. He extends his arms halfway 
               up, his fists clenched tightly as if drawing urgently on the 
               power within himself. The sound of wings is heard as he flaps 
               his arms.

               The arrow flies toward Arthur.

               Arthur sees the arrow coming right at him, when a swooping 
               crow plucks it out of the air.

               Arthur watches the crow flapping its wings, climbing swiftly, 
               the arrow in its beak, disappearing over the forest. Only he 
               has noticed.

               When he turns Merlin is no longer at his side; to the 
               puzzlement of all. And Arthur is all of a sudden terribly 
               alone and afraid, as people from all sides clamor for his 
               attention and guidance.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Arthur charges through the shadowy forest. He is in armor, 
               but it is only a light tunic of mail. Excalibur is sheathed 
               in a leather scabbard by his side. He is frantic and he calls 
               urgently.

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...Merlin... Merlin...

               His face shines with sweat, the horse is lathered. He 
               dismounts and continues on foot into denser, more tangled 
               undergrowth.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin!

               A huge eye opens in the foreground of what had appeared to 
               be shadow, bark and tufts of weeds is really Merlin's head.

                                     MERLIN
                         You called, sir?

               His voice is thin as he is awakening from a deep, exhausted 
               sleep. Arthur finds him lying within the large gnarled roots 
               of a great tree. The boy kneels before Merlin and lifts his 
               hands and kisses them.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You saved me from the arrow...

                                     MERLIN
                              (a flicker of mischief)
                         But not from your destiny.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I want to thank you.

                                     MERLIN
                         That's not why you came.

               Arthur blurts it out:

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin, help me. I need your help. I 
                         don't know how--

                                     MERLIN
                              (irritated)
                         'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.

               Arthur helps Merlin up and the wizard stands unsteadily.

                                     MERLIN
                         I'm tired. Doing magic takes its 
                         toll, you know. My arms ache 
                         terribly...
                              (he makes flying 
                              movements with his 
                              arms and grimaces)
                         Once--or is it yet to happen--I stood 
                         exposed to the Dragon's breath so 
                         that a man could lie one night with 
                         a woman. It took me ten moons to 
                         recover. I'm sure that story would 
                         interest you, since... Well, we'll 
                         have to talk about it another time. 
                         You're too busy now.

               The forest groans and creaks, alive with murmurs and shrill 
               calls.

                                     MERLIN
                         It is whispered in the forest that...
                              (he cups his ear with 
                              exaggeration)
                         ...Leondegrance's castle is under 
                         siege by Lot and Uryens.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (pressing)
                         Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody 
                         does. Lord Leondegrance is my only 
                         ally among the barons and the great 
                         knights. I can't lose him.

                                     MERLIN
                         Well there. You don't need me half 
                         as much as you think you do. You 
                         already know what must not happen.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (exasperated)
                         I must find the means to save him, 
                         then. I was hoping I could ask you 
                         for a little magic help, but if it 
                         makes you so tired...

                                     MERLIN
                         Thank you.

               Silence. Arthur tries again.

                                     ARTHUR
                         It's just that I have no experience, 
                         and no men to speak of. How can I--

                                     MERLIN
                              (suddenly fierce)
                         Because you must! You and only you. 
                         Have you forgotten that it was you 
                         who freed Excalibur?

               Just as suddenly, he is his amused, ironic self again.

                                     MERLIN
                         Besides, it will be a good lesson.
                              (giggling)
                         The best, if it's not the last.

               Arthur bows his head, confused and almost defeated. Merlin 
               steals a look at him, and puts his arm around the boy.

                                     MERLIN
                         Maybe you'd like to meet the power 
                         that gave you the sword?

               He enjoys being cryptic.

                                     ARTHUR
                         How? Where?

                                     MERLIN
                         In the great book.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What book is that?

                                     MERLIN
                              (melodramatic)
                         The book without pages. Open before 
                         you, all around us. You can see it 
                         in bits and pieces, for if mortal 
                         men were to see it whole and all 
                         complete in a single glance, why, it 
                         would burn him to cinders.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What?!

               EXT. FOREST AND ELSEWHERE - DAY AND NIGHT

                                     MERLIN
                         The dragon! There...

               A deep cleft at the edge of the forest, where far below lava 
               boils with a phosphorescence that lights up a great cloud, 
               billowing upward.

                                     MERLIN
                         Coiled in the unfathomed depths, it 
                         emerges...

               Merlin points to the sky where roiling clouds appear to be 
               unfurling of immeasurable wings.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...It unfolds itself in the storm 
                         clouds...

               A terrific wave batters a coastline, spray shooting up, and 
               as the wave recedes it exposes dark rocks and deep crevices.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...it washes its mane sparkling white 
                         in the blackness of seething 
                         whirlpools...

               Merlin spins Arthur around, and they are transported into a 
               storm swept forest. Lightning strikes.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...its claws are the forks of 
                         lightning... its scales glisten in 
                         the bark of trees...

               The trees shine with wetness, as a great wind tosses their 
               crowns, the branches groaning against each other.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...its voice is heard in the 
                         hurricane...

               Arthur is awestruck.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Arthur and Merlin are back in the same spot, having in fact 
               never moved at all, but traveled on the spell of Merlin's 
               words alone.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...it is so much more than a scaly 
                         monster. It is Everything!

               Arthur's eyes shine with the brilliance of the vision.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And if I am to be King of everything, 
                         lord and commoner, beast, leaf and 
                         rock, I must use its voice, its claws, 
                         its power.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CASTLE OF CAMELYARDE - NIGHT

               Leondegrance, Lord of Camelyarde, is shocked by what he sees 
               in the distance. His daughter Guenevere, a beautiful girl of 
               sixteen, draws close to him, terrified. With his surviving 
               knights, Leondegrance is making his last stand. The walls 
               have been breached, parts of the castle are burning.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               A bellowing dragon advances. Its eyes burn, its scales gleam 
               from light shining from within. It snorts fire from its 
               nostrils.

               Uryens and Lot, Caradoc and Turquine, the great knights in 
               command of the siege of Leondegrance's castle, back away 
               speechless as the monster descends upon their unprepared war 
               camp. All around them, squires and lesser knights flee in 
               panic and confusion.

               Only a dozen or so remain with their leaders. The group backs 
               up against the swampy moat that surrounds the castle, waiting 
               with swords drawn.

               The dragon moves closer, and now it becomes apparent that it 
               is nothing more than a force of knights and footmen. Their 
               shields glinting in the moonlight are the dragon's scales, 
               torches its burning eyes. And the snorting flames from its 
               nostrils are only Merlin doing a fire-eater's trick.

               The dragon form dissolves, and a banner rises bearing the 
               emblem of the Dragon, and under it, Arthur and Ector and Kay 
               lead a charge of twenty knights.

               In Arthur's hands, Excalibur leaves an electric glow upon 
               the air.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - NIGHT

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Father, it's the boy King.

                                     LEONDEGRANCE
                         It is. I will fight my way to his 
                         side.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Arthur and his men charge into the enemy ranks. Lot's and 
               Uryens' people are pushed into the moat. Although the water 
               is only waist-deep, the fallen, weighed down by their armor, 
               drown. The horses of the attackers are brought down, Arthur's 
               among them. He pulls out from under it, limping. Bleeding 
               form wounds, cutting, slashing, thrusting, he falls back 
               from the havoc of the charge.

               A small distance exists now between the foes, a brief respite. 
               Uryens and Lot, exhausted, bleeding, and fierce in their 
               rage:

                                     URYENS
                         War-wise fighters, grown gray in 
                         battle, checkmated by a boy.

                                     LOT
                         It's Merlin's trickery, nothing more. 
                         I won't swear faith to that wizard's 
                         brat.

               Arthur and his men have been joined by Leondegrance and his 
               knights, few in number.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Let's finish this with a show of 
                         force. We have no more tricks and no 
                         more advantages.

               He rushes alone at the enemy, shouting at the top of his 
               lungs, Excalibur flashing over his head, prepared to die.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Guenevere watches...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         No...

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         No... Arthur--

               The old knight rushes after the boy, sword drawn, to defend 
               his flank, and the others follow, a battle cry issuing from 
               them that is terrifying in its fierceness.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS AND BATTLEFIELD BELOW - NIGHT

               ...and when she can't watch any longer, she buries her face 
               in her hands.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Arthur fights like a wounded lion at the center of the savage 
               melee of sword and shield, and once again the two sides fall 
               apart.

               Uryens and Lot are standing in the moat among the bodies of 
               their men, are reduced to eleven knights, all wounded.

               Arthur is flanked by twenty men at arms, most of them wounded, 
               and trembling now beyond exhaustion with blood lust. Arthur 
               steps forward alone, and addresses his opponents.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You are in my hands, to slay or spare. 
                         I need battle lords such as you. 
                         Swear faith to me and you shall have 
                         mercy.

                                     URYENS
                         Noble knights swear faith to a mere 
                         squire?

               Arthur turns, searching for Merlin. He spots him watching 
               from a distance. They stare at each other, Merlin implacable, 
               Arthur's eyes pleading. It's obvious that Merlin isn't going 
               to help.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You are right. I'm not yet a knight.
                              (gaining strength)
                         You, Uryens, will knight me.

               He unsheathes Excalibur and goes forward, kneeling before 
               Uryens and offering him the sword.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Then as knight to knight I can offer 
                         you mercy.

                                     MERLIN
                              (to himself)
                         What's this, what's this?!

               Arthur, kneeling, bows his head and Uryens steps up to him, 
               his features set. He accepts the sword. Lot watches, a mad 
               hope dancing in his eyes.

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Guenevere watches, frightened for Arthur, not daring to 
               breathe.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               Uryens stands towering above the boy. He smiles enigmatically. 
               He lifts Excalibur.

               Merlin is attempting to push through the crowded ranks to 
               get to Arthur.

               He's frantic and worried for once.

                                     MERLIN
                         I never saw this...

               Uryens swiftly lowers the sword on Arthur's neck; with the 
               flat of the blade he gives Arthur the three strokes.

                                     URYENS
                         In the name of God, of Saint Michael 
                         and Saint George, I give you the 
                         right to bear arms, the power to 
                         mete justice.

               Arthur looks up.

                                     ARTHUR
                         That duty I will solemnly obey as 
                         knight and King.

               Uryens is deeply moved.

                                     URYENS
                         Rise, my King. I am your humble 
                         knight, and I swear allegiance to 
                         the courage in your veins, for so 
                         strong it is, it's source must be 
                         Uther. I doubt you no more.

               Arthur rises and Uryens kneels and kisses his hands. Sir 
               Ector turns away to hide brimming tears. Merlin pushes through 
               finally, out of breath. Uryens embraces Leondegrance while 
               Lot and the other enemy knights kneel in turn and kiss 
               Arthur's hands.

               EXT. WOOD BY CAMELYARDE CASTLE - DAY

               The castle can be glimpsed through the trees. A clear spring 
               bubbles from the ground, and the sun splashes leaf, bird, 
               squirrel, and bee with golden light, and Arthur and Guenevere 
               too. Guenevere is serious and intent on her work.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Owww...

               With water from the spring, she is bathing a large cut on 
               his chest that has been stitched closed. Wounds on his arms, 
               and one on a calf also show evidence of her neat sewing. 
               She's just finishing, and she dabs his chest with a dry cloth.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         It didn't hurt too much, did it?

                                     ARTHUR
                         Ye...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         --I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've 
                         sewn my father's wounds more than 
                         once.

               He starts to get up.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Careful! You'll have to stay still 
                         for a few days or you'll tear them 
                         open.

               Arthur shivers at the thought.

                                     ARTHUR
                         But I have to leave tomorrow. The 
                         forests are thick with rebels, 
                         invaders plunder our shores...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         --And damsels in besieged castles 
                         are waiting to be rescued?

                                     ARTHUR
                         I didn't know Leondegrance had a 
                         daughter.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Well, then, I shall tell you which 
                         knights have maiden daughters, so 
                         you can avoid their castles.

               Arthur smiles at her, enjoying her jealousy, and it irritates 
               her a little.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         No, I think it's better if you just 
                         stay here to heal. At least a week.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I'm going.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth 
                         too.

               She touches his lips with hers, her eyelids fluttering shut. 
               He stares at her young beauty, and draws her into a long, 
               slow kiss.

               A shrill almost human squeal pierces the air not far away. 
               Arthur pulls away startled, half-rising. Guenevere giggles.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Would you rescue me from a fiery 
                         dragon, sir?

               She puts her arms around him, drawing him close again, 
               speaking in a half-whisper.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         It's just a furry little rabbit that 
                         took the bait and sprung the trap.

               They smile at each other, about to kiss. As they come closer:

                                     GUENEVERE
                         You'll find him served up to you 
                         tonight, cooked in a most excellent 
                         sauce...

               INT. BANQUET HALL, CAMELYARDE CASTLE - EVENING

               The soft beat of psaltery and the liquid flow of lute. A 
               serving platter bearing roast rabbit in rampant position is 
               carried across the hall. It is laid on the long raised table 
               before Arthur, who presides in the middle. He looks at it 
               suspiciously and blushes, remembering the afternoon; and it 
               looks back at him accusingly with its cherry eye.

               Guenevere is dancing around her father, lovely, gliding, 
               sensual. She sees Arthur and the rabbit and laughs out-right. 
               He twists off a leg of the rabbit and sinks his teeth into 
               it to hide his embarrassment. Guenevere passes to another 
               partner, smiling at him, radiant. Arthur watches her, his 
               heart breaking. He is in love.

               Merlin leans close.

                                     MERLIN
                         A king must marry, after all.

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...of course...

               Only then does he realize that Merlin has understood 
               everything. He is annoyed at being so transparent.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I love her. If she would be my queen, 
                         my dreams would be answered.

                                     MERLIN
                              (mischievous)
                         There are maidens as fair, and fairer 
                         than Guenevere. If I put my mind to 
                         it, I could see them now, many of 
                         them, weeping for love of you, 
                         watching the hills for you coming 
                         from the high towers of their castles. 
                         Offering you their every favor. Rich, 
                         clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, 
                         so be it.

               A shadow of doubt crosses Arthur's brow.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Who will it be? Put your mind to it, 
                         then.

                                     MERLIN
                         Guenevere. And a beloved friend who 
                         will betray you.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (smiling)
                         Guenevere...

                                     MERLIN
                         You're not listening. Your heart is 
                         not. Love is deaf as well as blind.

               Guenevere approaches, smiling and coquettish. She slaps her 
               hands, and a servant sets down a tray of pastries before 
               Arthur.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         They are only for you, for in them I 
                         mixed things that heal, but not too 
                         quickly; and things that make limbs 
                         sleepy, preventing escape, but keep 
                         one's mind sharp.

               She smiles at Arthur's embarrassment and confusion.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What's in them?

               She takes a cake and bites into it.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         It is an ancient mixture, containing 
                         only soft, unborn grains, and flavored 
                         with roses. The rest is secret.

               Guenevere offers one to Arthur, and he hesitates, looking at 
               it.

                                     MERLIN
                         Looking at the cake is like looking 
                         at the future. Until you have savored 
                         its bitterness and its sweetness, 
                         its texture and its perfume, what do 
                         you really know? And then, of course, 
                         it will he too late.

               Arthur bites into the cake, and Guenevere looks deep into 
               his eyes.

                                     MERLIN
                         Too late...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A LEGEND APPEARS:

               "...but for years war kept Arthur from thoughts of marriage."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. OAK FOREST - DAY

               War tents have been pitched beneath the majestic trees. Near 
               the banner of the Dragon a doe grazes. Arthur is older, in 
               battle-scarred plate armor, pacing and angry. He is watched 
               by his wounded and bruised knights--Kay, Uryens, Lot, 
               Leondegrance, Caradoc, and some new young faces among the 
               ranks. No one talks.

               The harsh clank of its battle trappings announces the arrival 
               of a horse. All eyes watch it walk into the camp. A knight 
               is slouched in the saddle.

               Arthur runs to meet the horse, followed by squires and some 
               of the knights.

               He eases the rider to the ground, unlaces his helmet. It is 
               Sir Ector, and his hauberk is badly dented. Tears burn in 
               Arthur's eyes.

                                     SIR ECTOR
                         He is the mightiest and fairest of 
                         knights.

                                     ARTHUR
                         We fought and won battles, and now 
                         one man defeats all my knights? I 
                         will go.

               He pushes past the knights and goes to his horse. Kay steps 
               in front of him.

                                     SIR KAY
                         A king must not engage in single 
                         contest. I'll go again.

               Arthur rises into the saddle and takes a jousting spear from 
               the rack.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Where is Merlin?

               The squires are silent.

               Arthur gallops off in the direction Sir Ector came from. His 
               knights are afraid for him.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               His countenance grim, Arthur gallops along a trail bordering 
               a plowed field when in it a scarecrow moves. It starts to 
               run as stick-wielding farmers pursue it. It is Merlin. Arthur 
               turns off into the field, and at the sight of an armored 
               knight on a war horse, the farmers turn and flee. Merlin 
               stops to catch his breath.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (angry)
                         I should have left you to fend for 
                         yourself.

                                     MERLIN
                         I had to weave a little enchantment 
                         on the bees so I could get some honey, 
                         and I didn't feel up to using any 
                         more magic just yet. Anyway, I was 
                         in less danger than you'll be in 
                         today.

               Arthur's hand is clenched tight around Excalibur's hilt.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So you were stealing their honey. 
                         They should have killed you.

                                     MERLIN
                         Come now. So much anger for such a 
                         little crime? Are you sure there is 
                         nothing else troubling you?

                                     ARTHUR
                         You know full well there is, and I 
                         go to meet it now. Come witness my 
                         revenge.

               He offers his arm and Merlin hoists himself up behind the 
               King.

               EXT. GORGE THROUGH THE HILLS - DAY

               A waterfall cascades into a pool. The spray casts a rainbow. 
               Beneath it is a colorful confusion of flowers and budding 
               trees, a place dreamlike in its beauty.

               Arthur, with Merlin behind, gallops along the edge of the 
               pool. The trail widens into a field of grass. Arthur reins 
               beside a pile of broken lances and twisted shields. Across 
               the field, pitched upon the trail is a war tent made of 
               diaphanous white silk, a sky blue banner above it. Merlin 
               slides off and Arthur continues.

               From the tent, a knight with jousting lance rides forward to 
               meet him. His armor is so shiny it is a mirror. His eyes, 
               seen through the open visor, seem to laugh. His speech is 
               foreign, from across the sea. He is Lancelot of the Lake.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Good day to you, sir.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Move aside. This is the King's road, 
                         and the knights you joined arms 
                         against were his very own.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I await the King himself. His knights 
                         are in need of training.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am King, and this is Excalibur, 
                         sword of kings from the dawn of time. 
                         Who are you, and why do you block 
                         the way?

                                     LANCELOT
                         I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from 
                         across the sea. I am the best knight 
                         in the whole of Christiandom, and I 
                         look for the king who is worthy of 
                         my sword's service.

                                     ARTHUR
                         --That is a wild boast. You lack a 
                         knight's humility.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Not a boast, sir, but a curse.
                              (a cloud passes over 
                              his innocent face)
                         Never have I met my match in joust 
                         or duel.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Move aside!

                                     LANCELOT
                         I will not. You must retreat or prove 
                         your kingship in the test of arms, 
                         under the eyes of God.

               He crosses himself.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Then may He give me the strength to 
                         unhorse you and send you with one 
                         blow back across the sea.

               Arthur wheels away, trembling with anger, and gallops to his 
               edge of the field. He sees that Lancelot has already 
               positioned himself and is waiting, lance down.

               Merlin watches, a spectator, as the two charge at each other. 
               They collide with great force, their spears shattering. Arthur 
               is jolted but stays in the saddle. Lancelot's jousting is 
               impeccable. Arthur draws Excalibur.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Hold! I offer you another lance.

               Pages come forward with new lances for Arthur and Lancelot.

                                     LANCELOT
                         You joust well, sir. Battle learnt, 
                         but tournament fancy. You should 
                         ride more forward in the saddle, 
                         though.

               Arthur grabs the spear from the page's hands, and circles 
               back to work the horse up into an all-out gallop. Lancelot 
               spurs forward to meet him. Arthur is neatly unhorsed. He 
               picks himself up from the ground in a rage, drawing Excalibur. 
               Lancelot on his horse weaves circles around him.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Yield. I have the advantage.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I will not.

               Arthur charges Lancelot, a raging bull, but cuts and slashes 
               only at the air as Lancelot stays clear of him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Fight me from your horse or on foot, 
                         but fight me. Your avoidance mocks 
                         me.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I sought only not to harm you, sir.

               He dismounts and draws his sword, and they clash. Shield and 
               sword and armor against shield and sword and armor. The 
               swordplay is furious, Arthur attacking, slashing, hacking, 
               Lancelot parrying effortlessly, elegantly defensive. Arthur 
               breaks the onslaught to catch his breath. Lancelot lifts his 
               visor. His eyes are calm, laughing.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. 
                         It seems you would fight to the death 
                         against a knight who is not your 
                         enemy, for a length of road you can 
                         ride around.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So be it, to the death.

                                     LANCELOT
                         It is you, sir, who knows not the 
                         virtue of humility, as a true king 
                         must.

               Arthur goes forward attacking with terrible blows upon 
               Lancelot's shield, and Lancelot holds his ground, shield 
               high. And in its mirror-like metal Arthur can see his own 
               reflection, a face distorted by uncontrolled passion.

               Arthur discards his own shield, grabs Excalibur with both 
               hands, and with a frightening shout that speaks of all his 
               rage, he swings a terrific blow upon the shield, cutting 
               through his own reflection and the metal. And Excalibur snaps 
               in two.

               A blinding blue-green light explodes from the broken sword. 
               Lancelot, knocked back by the force of the blow, is stunned 
               by the blast and falls to the ground unconscious. Arthur 
               backs away, horrified, half of Excalibur in his hand.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What horror is this?
                              (calling)
                         Merlin!

               Merlin approaches, pale, gripped by dread.

                                     MERLIN
                         The sword is broken. Hope is broken...

               Arthur picks up the broken blade, utterly undone.

                                     ARTHUR
                         My pride broke it, my rage broke 
                         it... Humiliation and defeat lie in 
                         ambush even for a king.
                              (looking at Lancelot)
                         This excellent knight who fought 
                         with fairness and grace was meant to 
                         win. With Excalibur, I tried to change 
                         that verdict.

               Merlin stands there, drawn, defeated, his hopes dead.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I have lost for all time the ancient 
                         sword of my fathers whose power was 
                         meant to unite all men, to serve the 
                         vanity of a single man.

               Despairing, he flings the two parts of Excalibur into the 
               pool. He kneels at the waters edge, and he cries.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am nothing.

               Then Arthur sees something that startles him. Beneath the 
               surface, suspended in the blue-green water amid the dancing 
               weeds, he sees Excalibur, intact.

               It is held by a maiden in flowing gown the color of water, 
               her long hair rippling across her face, obscuring it.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Excalibur! Is it true?

                                     MERLIN
                         The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take 
                         it, quickly!

               Arthur dips his hand under the water and grasps the hilt and 
               the moment he does the vision in the blue-green water fades. 
               He rises with Excalibur in hand, and Merlin speaks before 
               Arthur can ask the question.

                                     MERLIN
                         There are infinite worlds within the 
                         infinite coils of the Dragon. In one 
                         of them, which I have not traveled, 
                         the sword was forged. I only know 
                         that the King is returned to us 
                         through the instrument of his power. 
                         The game continues!

               And he laughs.

               Just then Lancelot stirs. Arthur rushes to his side. He 
               loosens his helmet and removes it, uncovering damp curls. 
               The young knight's eyes open, and his laughing charm once 
               more animates his face.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Thanks to God, you are alive.

                                     LANCELOT
                              (sitting up)
                         I, the best knight in the world, 
                         bested! This is a great day, for my 
                         search is over. I love you, my King.

               He embraces Arthur, who is overwhelmed by his childlike 
               directness. The King helps him to his feet.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You are still the best knight in 
                         Christiandom. You gained a hundred 
                         advantages over me. It is I who must 
                         love you, for through your courage 
                         and patience you taught me a bitter 
                         lesson.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Then make me your champion and I 
                         will always fight in your place.

                                     ARTHUR
                         But your life and lands are far from 
                         here.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I gave up my castles and my lands!

               He thumps his breastplate.

                                     LANCELOT
                         My domain is here, inside this metal 
                         skin. And I would pledge to you all 
                         that I still own: muscle, bone, blood 
                         and the heart that pumps it.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, 
                         you will be my champion.

               Lancelot draws his sword, holding it by the blade, a crucifix.

                                     LANCELOT
                         In the name of Jesus Christ and His 
                         holy blood, I swear eternal faith to 
                         Arthur, King.

               They embrace, and Merlin watches.

               EXT. ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               Converging from different directions parties of mounted 
               knights enter the war camp. Lancelot among them. They 
               dismount, battle-weary and burning with the excitement of 
               victory. They quench their huge thirst from buckets carried 
               by squires. They rip off hunks of meat from carcasses sizzling 
               on spits over a roaring fire. And they join the throng of 
               knights, where stories of deeds of arms of the day are 
               enthusiastically exchanged.

               A great number of knights are packed tightly around King 
               Arthur, each man anxious to tell of his victories. One of 
               them has the King's attention.

                                     KNIGHT
                         ...We killed every one of them. Burnt 
                         their ship...

               Arthur sees Lancelot in the throng and moves toward him. 
               Merlin follows Arthur and is pushed and knocked around in 
               the crush of spikes and iron. The only unarmored man in the 
               crowd, he glares at the excited knights irritably.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lancelot, how did you fare in the 
                         North?

                                     LANCELOT
                         We spared the lives of a few, so 
                         they could sail home and tell their 
                         fellows what fate they met at the 
                         hands of King Arthur's knights...

               Arthur turns toward Uryens.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And you, Uryens?

                                     URYENS
                         Victory!

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lot, and you?

                                     LOT
                         We drove the invaders into the sea.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You, Gawain, the East?

                                     GAWAIN
                         The East is ours again.

               Cheers greet each declaration.

                                     ARTHUR
                         The war is over. One land, one King. 
                         Peace.

               Amidst the celebration, a fracas is heard. A knight pushing 
               forward to talk to Arthur has entered a shoving match with 
               those in front of him.

                                     KNIGHT
                         Let me through. I fought the King's 
                         battle too. He must know my story.

               Merlin is brutally jostled. He draws a fistful of powder 
               from his cape and he tosses it into the air above him. He 
               raises his staff into the cloud, cracking it like a whip. 
               The tip of the staff catches fire, and the fire spreads 
               through the powder in the air, stunning all into silence. 
               Merlin shouts and snarls.

                                     MERLIN
                         Chaos... confusion... brutes... 
                         savages... troglodytes... Stand 
                         back... make space.

               Merlin swings his burning staff into a wide arc. The knights 
               back away, amused at first, then a bit afraid.

                                     MERLIN
                         The moon... the sun... the stars... 
                         they spin... they turn... they 
                         circle... around us... us...

               The knights have fallen back. Merlin stalks past each man, 
               and Arthur too, holding the flaming tip of his staff before 
               each pair of eyes, and staring into them with his gimlet 
               gaze.

                                     MERLIN
                         You, and you, and you, take up your 
                         place. Be wedded to the world. Respect 
                         its perfection. All of you, together, 
                         be one.

               The knights have formed a circle. They realize this. 
               Awestruck, they whisper in astonishment, looking up at the 
               sky burning with stars. Merlin brims with pride as he waits 
               for Arthur to recognize his handiwork.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Your ancient wisdom and infinite 
                         sight have forged this circle, Merlin. 
                         Hereafter we shall come together in 
                         a circle, to tell and hear of deeds 
                         good and brave. I will build a table 
                         where this fellowship shall meet. 
                         And a hall around the table. And a 
                         castle about the hall.

               A cheer rises. Arthur strides into the ring of knights.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And I will marry.

               Another bout of cheers goes up, and Arthur stops before 
               Leondegrance, resting his hand on the old knight's shoulder.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And the land will have an heir to 
                         wield Excalibur.

               Leondegrance's eyes fill with tears of joy. A roar of cheers. 
               Arthur draws the sword of power.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Knights of the Round Table, good 
                         friends, brothers in arms. I send 
                         you on a quest harder by far than 
                         the battles we have fought together, 
                         a quest to uphold always, and 
                         everywhere, justice, honor, and truth. 
                         Each day shall bring forth a cause, 
                         and may each cause bring forth a 
                         knight.

               Lancelot is drawn in by the King's enthusiasm. He unsheathes 
               his sword and swoops it low in salute.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I swear never to rest twice on the 
                         same pillow till all men live at 
                         peace.

               In quick succession all knights draw their swords, following 
               Lancelot's example.

               Merlin struggles to put out the flame on his staff. He finally 
               does it by smothering it with earth. When he looks up again, 
               he sees the knights galloping off in all directions.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

               Terrified women, a screaming child, cowering men, old or 
               made old by the hard labor of the fields. Armored men are 
               ransacking a farm, looking for grain, and gold which they 
               find among the votive objects of a little house altar. A 
               woman is dragged away to be raped.

               Through a window, a knight in shining armor is seen emerging 
               from the adjoining woods. The plunderers are all of a sudden 
               apprehensive, and fall silent. One of them grabs the crying 
               child and covers her mouth with his iron hand.

               EXT. FARMYARD - DAY

               The knight is Lancelot, in his mirror-like armor. He rides 
               into the cluster of houses and barns that make up the farm. 
               There are other armored men there, around a cart half-loaded 
               with loot. They smile nervously at Lancelot. The farmers are 
               blank with fear.

               Lancelot stops in the middle of the yard. A knight among the 
               armored men comes forward.

                                     KNIGHT
                         Good day, sir.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Good day to you.

               And he also acknowledges with a nod the ashen-faced patriarch 
               of the community.

               Lancelot spurs his horse on, and the knight sighs with relief. 
               But then he reins his horse to a stop. He has sensed 
               something. He turns his head, his hooded eyes on the knight 
               and his men, and they squirm inwardly.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

               The child, her mouth covered by the armored hand.

               EXT. FARMYARD - DAY

               Lancelot, listening, watching.

               INT. BARN - DAY

               The woman, a blade flashing next to her eye.

               EXT. FARMYARD - DAY

               Lancelot, immobile. Behind him, the knight, his face shiny 
               with sweat. His minions inch forward, hands moving slowly 
               toward sword hilts.

               Lancelot wheels his horse around.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I hear the stifled cry for help, I 
                         smell the reek of fear...

               With a shout the knight and his men draw their swords and 
               rush Lancelot. He reins in his horse, causing it to rear and 
               break their attack. He slides off, falling on his feet with 
               sword drawn, already fighting. In an extraordinary show of 
               sword play he cuts down six men.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

               Hearing Lancelot storm in, the man holding the child hands 
               her to a woman and kneels before the altar, just as Lancelot 
               bursts into the room, sword high and already swooping down 
               on the man's neck. Lancelot brings the sword to a halt mid-
               air, his fury held in check. The repent man is spared. The 
               woman kneels to kiss Lancelot's hand.

               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               The field is pitched with war tents and pavilions decked for 
               holiday. Nobles and knights flank the King and Guenevere, a 
               beautiful vision in white samite, a wreath of flowers around 
               her head. Lancelot leads a long file of prisoners to the 
               King. They fall to their knees, begging forgiveness; among 
               them is the man whom Lancelot had spared before the altar.

                                     LANCELOT
                         These men repented before God for 
                         their evil deeds. Those who would 
                         not, met their fate at the end of my 
                         sword.
                              (he kneels)
                         Accept the fruit of my first quest 
                         as my wedding gift.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.

               He rises and follows Arthur and Guenevere into the central 
               pavilion. Pages draw its curtains closed as they pass inside.

               INT. PAVILION - DAY

               Guenevere is surrounded by a group of ladies and maids who 
               fuss over her dress and her hair. They eye the great knight 
               and whisper about him, Guenevere laughing with them.

               Arthur sits, excited and happy.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Sit beside me, Lancelot.

               Lancelot sits, stiff and upright.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Your deeds set an example for all 
                         other knights. For your gift, ask a 
                         gift of me.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Only give me leave to ride out again, 
                         to do what I am most able to do, and 
                         happiest doing.

               Guenevere overhears. She approaches and Lancelot jumps to 
               his feet.

                                     GUENEVERE
                              (to Arthur)
                         He must stay for the feasting days 
                         of our wedding, and tell his deeds 
                         himself.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (to Lancelot, smiling)
                         I grant you your wish if you grant 
                         Lady Guenevere hers.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I will stay Madame.

               Merlin leans close to Arthur.

                                     MERLIN
                         The knights of Galys approach the 
                         camp. It would be politic...

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...to ride out and meet them.

               He rises. Lancelot, who was about to sit again, straightens.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, 
                         rest here.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Don't start a war on my wedding day!

                                     ARTHUR
                         Without Lancelot?!

               Arthur and Merlin exit, leaving Guenevere and Lancelot. She 
               looks at him, lively and amused, and he can't help smiling.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Look Lancelot. The maids and ladies 
                         whisper about you. They all dream of 
                         winning you, young and old, fair and 
                         ugly.

               Lancelot blushes.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         But surely that's no secret to you, 
                         dear Lancelot. You're the bravest 
                         and strongest knight they've ever 
                         seen, and beauty has kissed your 
                         brow.

               He can't look at her.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         The well-kept secret is whether any 
                         of them has won your heart.

                                     LANCELOT
                         No.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Why?

                                     LANCELOT
                         I am a fighting man and I am married 
                         to the quest. That is enough.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         And there is no maiden in the whole 
                         world who inspires you?

                                     LANCELOT
                         There is one.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Who?!

                                     LANCELOT
                         You.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Me?

                                     LANCELOT
                         Yes. I would swear my love to you.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         To me? But why?

                                     LANCELOT
                         I cannot love as a woman the lady 
                         who will be wife to my King and my 
                         friend. And, in pledging my love to 
                         you, I cannot love any other woman.

               Guenevere smiles, moved by his blunt innocence.

                                     LANCELOT
                         I will see you in all women, and I 
                         will defend them as I would defend 
                         you.

               He kneels, kisses her thigh, rises and leaves.

               INT. CHAPEL - DAY

               A chorus of children sings. The Bishop waits at the altar 
               with his friars and altar boys. Cornucopias overflowing with 
               vegetables and wildflowers adorn the church, which glows 
               with the light of a thousand candles. Sir Kay is satisfied. 
               He comes back up the petal-strewn aisle.

               EXT. CHAPEL, SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY

               Arthur and Guenevere are ushered in by Kay. They are flanked 
               by Leondegrance and Sir Ector. Lancelot and Merlin follow, 
               leading the cortege of knights and ladies.

               Merlin is incapable of entering the chapel, as if at the 
               threshold there is an unseen force that repels him.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Lord Merlin, are you ill?

                                     MERLIN
                         No, no, I need air.

               Strangling a laugh he wrenches himself away. Just then Uryens 
               and a small party of knights rides up through the tents and 
               dismounts in front of the church. Uryens helps a lady off 
               her horse and joins the cortege on foot.

                                     URYENS
                         Merlin, don't you join the 
                         celebration?

               Merlin, who was slinking away through the throng of 
               bystanders, looks up. What he sees sends a chill through his 
               body.

               At Uryens' side stands a young woman of sinister beauty, 
               with bewitching eyes of ice. Merlin just stares at her, and 
               she smiles back at him faintly.

                                     URYENS
                         My wife, Merlin. Lady Morgana of 
                         Cornwall.

                                     MORGANA
                         I remember you, Merlin. I was a child. 
                         You took my brother away.

               Merlin laughs. Uryens shrugs and continues into the chapel 
               with Morgana. As she enters she glances back, and just then 
               Merlin steals a look, their eyes meet.

               INT. CHAPEL - DAY

               Uryens and Morgana take their places near the altar. Arthur 
               and Guenevere kneel before the Bishop, and Arthur takes her 
               hand. The clatter of armor mingles with the enthusiastic, 
               happy singing of the children, and seems to strengthen their 
               song.

               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - EVENING

               The chorus carries across the field to the dark wall of trees 
               from which issues another chorus, of hoots and squawks and 
               howls. Merlin advances along the edge of the forest. He stops 
               by the stone that once held the sword, his eyes wild. He 
               forgets his inner torment when he sees a plant at the base 
               of the stone. He kneels beside it and plucks it. He admires 
               its strange flowers; he smells them.

               Two feet appear at his side. He rises to be face to face 
               with Morgana. They look deep into each other. Then Merlin 
               breaks the silence.

                                     MERLIN
                         You left your husband's side? You 
                         left your brother's wedding?

                                     MORGANA
                         Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?

                                     MERLIN
                         It is.

                                     MORGANA
                         Can it truly be used for magic?

               Merlin smiles at last, and Morgana does, her eyes piercing, 
               cruel and lovely.

                                     MERLIN
                         Yes... sometimes...

               His gaze drifts toward the chapel.

                                     MERLIN
                         ...There are many powers in this 
                         world.

               INT. CHAPEL - EVENING

               Arthur and Guenevere are radiant with joy, and Lancelot behind 
               them mirrors the ceremony of their joining in his armor; and 
               the sweet voices of the children fill the chapel as the Bishop 
               pours the wine into the chalice, and lifts it up before him, 
               blessing it.

               He turns to the royal couple.

                                     BISHOP
                         Drink this the blood of Jesus Christ 
                         our Lord.

               The chalice seems to burn with a mystical light; and as the 
               chorus soars:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A LEGEND APPEARS:

               "And Arthur built his castle, Camelot. And one day, in the 
               far reaches of the Kingdom..."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. FOREST, STREAM - DAY

               It is shadowy and dark; ancient trees creak, unseen animals 
               cry out. A rabbit hops into view and a boy leaps forward, 
               grabbing the animal by the ears before it can move. He--
               Perceval--is a wild boy of seventeen, dressed in skins with 
               an endearing and childlike smile.

                                     PERCEVAL
                              (to the rabbit)
                         Sorry. Hungry.

               A din is heard to the forest, and it grows. Perceval glances 
               around, panicked. The sound is the rubbing of leather upon 
               leather, of metal on metal, for now a mounted figure in armor 
               hovers over the terrified boy.

                                     PERCEVAL
                              (stuttering)
                         Have I taken too much?

               He lets the rabbit go free. The threatening figure dismounts. 
               And Perceval, cartwheels backward, landing in the stream and 
               scooping a fish out.

                                     PERCEVAL
                              (desperately trying 
                              to ingratiate)
                         I had rabbit yesterday. Today I'll 
                         eat fish... No?

               He returns the fish to the water. The figure steps into a 
               pool of sunlight and a glorious halo streaks from the armor. 
               It is Lancelot.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Don't be afraid.

               Perceval is overcome with astonishment, and he kneels.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You're an angel! Not a devil...

               Lancelot laughs and pulls the boy to his feet.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Just a man. A knight in the King's 
                         service.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You're a man?!
                              (he reaches out to 
                              touch Lancelot)
                         ...with metal skin!

               Perceval is beside himself with enthusiasm.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Can I grow metal skin?

               Lancelot rolls his eyes, amused.

                                     LANCELOT
                         You've got a lot to learn.

               EXT. SPARSE FOREST - DAY

               Lancelot is cantering and Perceval is running alongside, 
               shouting in gasps.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I'll learn... take me... to the 
                         King... What's a... King?

               Lancelot shakes his head and spurs the horse into a gallop. 
               Perceval lengthens his stride, and keeps up! Lancelot reins 
               to a halt.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Very well. Climb up.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I will run.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Listen, boy, it's more than twenty 
                         days from here.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Twenty days!? The world is that big?

               EXT. OUTSIDE CAMELOT, FOREST - DAY

               Perceval cannot believe his eyes. As Lancelot and Kay talk 
               about him out of earshot, he sees things that he's never 
               seen before; and he gapes like the country bumpkin that he 
               is.

               Dragon-like kites sweep low, maneuvered by children. In a 
               meadow among the trees, knights hone their skills with lance 
               and sword, and ladies watch and their "bright eyes rain 
               influence and judge the prize." And then, there is Camelot 
               itself; the great gate and the drawbridge; the massive walls, 
               and the soaring towers and spires above.

               Perceval rushes up to Lancelot and Kay.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Who will give me my sword?

               Kay is not at all pleased; nonetheless he takes the boy by 
               the ear and leads him across the drawbridge and into the 
               castle.

                                     KAY
                         Kitchen knives and greasy spits will 
                         be your weapons, boy.

               Lancelot smiles to himself, hesitation, lingering before the 
               great gate of Camelot.

               There is a walkway suspended in the trees above, that also 
               leads to the castle, and promenading on it is a group of 
               women, Guenevere and her ladies-in-waiting. The Queen sees 
               Lancelot and hastens toward him.

               Lancelot sees her, and mounts his horse and heads back into 
               the forest. She stops, somewhat ahead of the ladies, and 
               watches wistfully.

               Lancelot turns back and seeing her one last time, draws down 
               his visor and spurs his horse into a canter.

               He passes two commoners who are heading for the castle, one 
               fat and the other thin, and they are locked in hot dispute. 
               Their wives keep them from coming to blows and their children 
               spur them on, enjoying the excitement.

               Lancelot is swallowed by the forest.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - DAY

               Guenevere, bearing a bowl of perfect, deep red apples, 
               approaches the Round Table, where Arthur sits and Merlin at 
               his side, attending to the affairs of the kingdom. Quite a 
               few of the knights occupy their seats, talking with each 
               other, drinking and laughing, attended by ladies and pages. 
               Guenevere places the apples at Lancelot's empty place and 
               takes her seat next to Arthur.

               In the archways that lead into the hall, petitioners wait, 
               eating, drinking, talking among themselves. In the din, no 
               one pays attention to the vehement arguing of the fat man 
               and the thin man, which continues even here. The hall is the 
               burgeoning, happy center of the kingdom.

               But Merlin is oblivious to the lively clamor. He gazes like 
               a lovesick puppy across the table at Morgana, who bends over 
               whispering to a knight at the table, the young Sir Gahalt,, 
               while his older brother Sir Gawain listens. Morgana notices 
               Merlin's stare and smiles at him, and then resumes her 
               flirtation with Sir Gahalt, much to Merlin's annoyance.

               Sir Kay ushers the thin man and the fat man into the open 
               space at the center of the table for their audience with the 
               king. They quarrel even as Kay tries to present them, and 
               the attention of the hall gradually focuses on them.

               The two men talk at once, interrupting, overlapping.

                         FAT MAN
                 I brew ale, sir--from 
                 old shoes--I am an 
                 honest tradesman sir. 
                 I must sell what I 
                 produce. He won't buy 
                 ale and he won't pay. 
                 Pay up! He leans over 
                 the barrel and sucks 
                 in the vapors. The 
                 vapors are mine.

                                                       THIN MAN
                                               How would you know I, sir, 
                                               have the misfortune to 
                                               live next to this 
                                               criminal... What loss in 
                                               that? Not to me! Pay for 
                                               what? Why?! They are 
                                               floating on the wind. 

               Arthur is both amused and exasperated.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Enough!... What is a fair price for 
                         the smell of your ale?

                                     FAT MAN
                         That's why we have come to you, sir 
                         There's no one else who can tell us.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What does it cost to get drunk on 
                         your ale?

                                     FAT MAN
                         At least three shillings, sir.

               Arthur addresses the Thin Man.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Give me three shillings.

               The Thin Man is crestfallen, the smile gone from his face. 
               He reluctantly hands the coins to Kay, who gives them to 
               Arthur. Arthur tosses them in the air and lets them fall on 
               a metal plate. He hands them back to the Thin Man, who is 
               totally confused now, as is everybody else.

                                     ARTHUR
                         For the smell of your ale, the jingle 
                         of his coins.

               The knights roar with laughter and the Fat Man and the Thin 
               Man look at each other in astonishment. Perceval lets out a 
               raucous laugh that wins him a glance of disapproval from 
               Kay.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - NIGHT

               The din of the petitioners is replaced by music. It is the 
               hour of the evening feast, and all knights are present, except 
               Lancelot. Whole tree trunks burn in the great fireplace, and 
               lambs roast on spits in the flames. Pages run to and fro 
               with trays of food and wine, Perceval among them.

               Morgana stops beside Merlin.

                                     MORGANA
                         What did I see today in the wizard's 
                         eyes? Censure, because I enjoy a few 
                         words with a young handsome knight?

               Merlin is in agony, a bug stuck on a pin.

                                     MERLIN
                         No, no, of course not. You are 
                         young...

                                     MERLIN
                         I'm not jealous!

                                     MORGANA
                         It's clear you are, and it irks me.

                                     MERLIN
                         No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want 
                         to write poems about you with 
                         moonbeams, make the sea sing your 
                         name...

                                     MORGANA
                         A lovestruck page!

                                     MERLIN
                         Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, 
                         please... Morgana.

               She does, laughing and in complete control. His hand 
               immediately slides onto her thigh. She removes it, but holds 
               it in her hand, toying with his fingers.

                                     MORGANA
                         A steamy, panting, lovestruck page. 
                         But what good are songs and poems to 
                         me? They are the barter of ordinary 
                         love. A gift that reflected your 
                         greatness is the only one worthy of 
                         your love.

               Merlin looks at her, knowing already, sad yet eager.

                                     MERLIN
                         I showed you all my conjuring 
                         tricks...

                                     MORGANA
                         The deepest secrets, the forbidden 
                         formulas...

                                     MERLIN
                         Maybe... maybe...

               Merlin's thoughts have carried him far away, when he realizes 
               that Arthur is addressing him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin, are you counselor to the 
                         King, or to my sister?

               Some knights laugh.

                                     MERLIN
                         At your service, sir.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Then answer me this. For years peace 
                         has reigned in the land. Crops grow 
                         in abundance, there is no want. Every 
                         one of my subjects enjoys his portion 
                         of happiness and justice, even those 
                         whose tiresome misunderstandings we 
                         must resolve here each day. Tell me, 
                         Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it 
                         seems?

                                     MERLIN
                         Good and evil; there is never one 
                         without the other.

               Arthur is taken aback.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

                                     MERLIN
                         Never where you expect it, that's 
                         all I know.

               He chuckles softly and Arthur is puzzled. A knight speaks 
               out, the young knight with whom Morgana was flirting. His 
               manner is sarcastic.

                                     SIR GAHALT
                         If we have peace and justice, why is 
                         Lancelot never with us? Why is he 
                         always riding out on his quests? He 
                         must know where this evil is.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         Could there be evil within Lancelot 
                         himself? To live above human folly, 
                         as is his aim, is to be overly proud.

                                     SIR GAHALT
                         He pays no heed even to the Queens 
                         longing for his company.

               The hall falls silent, all eyes upon the Queen.

                                     GUENEVERE
                              (lashing out)
                         What is it you would have your words 
                         mean, Sir Gahalt?

               Frightened, Gahalt doesn't answer. Morgana has slipped to 
               Guenevere's side.

                                     MORGANA
                         Don't listen to him. You are the 
                         Queen.

               Arthur, ashen-faced, turns to Merlin for help, but he has 
               escaped into sleep...

                                     ARTHUR
                         Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         No. I meant not to be angry with 
                         you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness 
                         that comes with peace gossip has 
                         bread its own evil. You merely repeat 
                         it. Please, sir, have one of those 
                         apples that Lancelot loves, and in 
                         that gesture partake of its goodness.

               Morgana picks the bowl up and as she does so, unseen by any 
               and with a magician's dexterity, she thrusts her fingernails 
               deep into the top apple. She gives the bowl to Guenevere, 
               who takes it and sweeps around to where Sir Gahalt sits, 
               followed by Morgana. The young knight jumps to his feet.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Take one, Sir Gahalt.

                                     SIR GAHALT
                         I am most honored, my lady.

               He is too shy to take the shiniest, most beautiful apple on 
               top, and goes for another one. Morgana giggles, and he looks 
               at her. She looks at the apple on top and then smiles 
               encouragingly at him. Sir Gahalt takes it and starts eating 
               as the Queen returns to her seat.

               With the third bite his is unable to breathe. His face goes 
               red and he rises to his feet, attempting to call out.

               He falls, dying immediately. All leap to their feet, and 
               Arthur rushes to the young knight. Merlin is asleep and far 
               from human affairs.

               Arthur and Sir Gawain rise from the body of the young knight. 
               Sir Gawain backs away from Arthur and points at Guenevere, 
               trembling with cold rage.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         Hear me, Lord Arthur, and knights 
                         and chieftains: I charge Guenevere 
                         with the murder of my brother.

               Guenevere, white and with a broken voice, turns to Arthur.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         I didn't... I am innocent.

               She begins to swoon and Morgana keeps her steady on her feet. 
               Arthur slumps into his seat and Sir Gawain kneels before 
               him.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         I champion this truth: That Queen 
                         Guenevere murdered Sir Gahalt with 
                         the aid of sorcery.

               Enraged, Arthur reaches for Excalibur. But with effort he 
               checks his impulse.

                                     ARTHUR
                         The Queen will be in my charge till 
                         a champion steps forward to fight on 
                         her behalf.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Not you, my husband?

               Arthur cannot look at her.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         She must be burnt at the stake. That 
                         is the sentence for murder done with 
                         magic.

                                     ARTHUR
                         It is. Lords and knights of the Round 
                         Table, as her husband I say that 
                         this deed was not done by Guenevere. 
                         Who among you will champion this 
                         truth?

               No one responds. Guenevere falls into her seat. Arthur 
               searches the eyes of his knights and they evade him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Sir Caradoc! You!

               The knight looks up.

                                     CARADOC
                         I am torn.

               Sir Ector, old and feeble, weeps for Arthur. Someone speaks 
               up. It is Perceval, who kneels before the Queen. His voice 
               is unnaturally loud, and his eyes shine with held-back tears; 
               he stutters.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I will champion you, my lady.

               He is overwhelmed by his own boldness. He looks around. All 
               eyes are upon him. Guenevere smiles at him, sadly.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         I thank you, but you are not yet a 
                         knight.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I will find Lancelot! He will come!

               Perceval hurries from the hall. Arthur looks away, ashamed, 
               and his eyes fall on Merlin, twitching and mumbling in his 
               sleep.

                                     MERLIN
                         Boys!... boys will be boys...

               EXT. HOVEL - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               In full armor but for his helmet, Lancelot is seated at a 
               small table in the shadow of a tree, eating an apple.

               A young girl is turning a chicken on a spit, and her mother 
               is removing freshly-baked bread from an oven. It is very 
               peaceful and silent until, galloping all out, Perceval 
               arrives. Frantic, out of breath, he leaps from his lathered 
               horse.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I have found you. The Queen. An apple.
                         Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...

                                     LANCELOT
                         --It must wait, child. These good 
                         ladies, for whom I intervened once, 
                         will honor me with a meal. I am 
                         beholden to them now as I was when 
                         they begged my protection.

               The two women set the chicken and the bread before the great 
               knight, and stand back to watch him eat, flushed with 
               excitement. Perceval falls silent, in awe of Lancelot.

               INT. BEDCHAMBER, CAMELOT - NIGHT

               Arthur stands hunched over the fireplace, staring into the 
               flames. Guenevere paces back and forth to a window.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Why can't you be my champion?

                                     ARTHUR
                         If I am your judge, I cannot be your 
                         champion. When I act as your King, I 
                         cannot be your husband.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         And you cannot love me...

                                     ARTHUR
                         The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, 
                         high and low, or they are not laws 
                         at all. Lancelot will come...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         And if he cannot be found, no other 
                         knight will champion me, though you 
                         beseeched each and every one of them. 
                         Why be king if there is no one you 
                         can call loyal subject but an eager 
                         boy?

               He hides his anguish from her. Numb with hurt, she goes to a 
               tall curtained window, and draws it open, and stands there 
               looking out upon the surrounding forest, silent and still 
               beneath the moon.

               EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

               She cries softly, and she whispers the name of the great 
               knight.

               EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST, WALLS OF CAMELOT - NIGHT.

               A mounted knight stands motionless at the edge of the forest, 
               his armor gleaming with dark lustre. It is Lancelot. His 
               eyes are raised to the high window, where he sees Guenevere. 
               He watches her in silence. In the high window Guenevere draws 
               the curtain and Lancelot reins back into the forest.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Lancelot has unsaddled and tethered his horse in a small 
               clearing. He sits, resting back against a tree. He removes 
               his helmet; he plants his sword before him, like a cross. He 
               loosens the ties of his breastplate. He waits for day, 
               yawning, tired. But his eyes burn, and he closes them and 
               nods off to sleep.

               A knight appears silently hovering over him. Lancelot looks 
               up, and his eyes go wide with fear. The knight towering above 
               him wears armor identical to his, and he raises his sword, 
               and the blade is descending upon Lancelot. Lancelot draws 
               his sword from the ground and rolls away, but the knight's 
               sword slices through his shoulder joint. Lancelot attempts 
               to rise but already the knight, Lancelot's mirror image, is 
               upon him. From the ground, Lancelot parries the blow and 
               slashes at the opponent's knee, cutting through the joint in 
               the armor and severing the leg.

               The knight doesn't fall, doesn't bleed, doesn't cry out. On 
               one leg he comes forward, a horror. Lancelot is paralyzed by 
               fear. As the knight leaps upon Lancelot, Lancelot rises to 
               meet him, impaling himself on the knight's sword below the 
               hauberk. He throws the knight to the ground, and comes down 
               upon him. He rips off the helmet and the breastplate. The 
               armor is empty and Lancelot rolls over on his back, awakening 
               from the nightmare with his own sword deep in his stomach, 
               and in his hand his own helmet and breastplate, while other 
               parts of his armor lie strewn around him.

               Only then does he become conscious of the terrible pain and 
               the shock of the truth. He grabs the hilt of his sword and 
               draws it from his stomach. He curls up in agony, clutching a 
               fistful of leaves to the wound.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Guenevere, I fight against myself...

               He loses consciousness.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAWN

               The Bishop blesses the field. Guenevere, numb and 
               disbelieving, is being led to the stake, which rises from a 
               bed of straw and wood. Arthur watches, in shock. Other knights 
               and ladies keep their distance, watching darkly, stealing 
               glances at Arthur, mumbling disapproval of his refusing to 
               defend Guenevere. In battle dress, Sir Gawain rides up and 
               down the jousting run on a snorting and powerful horse, 
               practicing. Perceval, in a mail doublet, waits beside a mangy 
               roan, his face burning with anxiety.

               Guenevere is tied to the stake. All eyes watch for the 
               approach of her champion. Arthur goes to Perceval.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Is he coming?

                                     PERCEVAL
                         He heard Lady Guenevere's request 
                         and he said nothing. That is all.

               Arthur hides his pain behind a rigid mask.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY

               The sun has risen shining cruelly into Guenevere's eyes; the 
               queen is alone at the stake. Sir Gawain rides up to King 
               Arthur, who waits alone, separated from the others.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         My Lord, the sun is upon the field. 
                         The Queen has no champion. I demand 
                         justice, as is my right.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So it is.

               Perceval leaps onto his horse.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Let me champion the Queen!

               Sir Gawain looks at the squire with contempt.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                              (to Arthur)
                         Since no knight comes forward, I 
                         demand justice--

               Arthur is in anguish. He searches the tree line for a sign 
               of Lancelot. He looks from Guenevere at the stake to his own 
               knights watching him. He draws Excalibur. A gasp goes through 
               the crowd of onlookers.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Boy, kneel.

               Perceval leaps from his horse and bends his knee before the 
               King. Arthur brings the sword down on the boy's shoulder, 
               giving him the three strokes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         In the name of God, of St. Michael, 
                         and St. George, I make you a knight. 
                         Rise, Sir...

                                     PERCEVAL
                         ...Perceval!

               Gawain shakes his head disdainfully as Perceval mounts back 
               into the saddle, his eyes burning with fervor.

               Sir Gawain and Perceval ride to opposite ends of the field. 
               The spectators fall silent, all staring blankly, their senses 
               dulled by the tragedy, at the uneven combatants.

               A cry goes up. Lancelot rides out of the forest. He rides up 
               to the King and salutes him. Arthur smiles at his old friend, 
               tears of joy in his eyes. Lancelot bows toward Guenevere and 
               rides on to where Perceval waits.

               Lancelot reaches out to touch Perceval's cheek.

                                     LANCELOT
                         It's my task to prove the Queen's 
                         innocence.

               Perceval cannot reply, his eyes affixed on the blood that 
               trickles from Lancelot's hauberk. Lancelot raises his lance 
               in salute to Gawain across the field. Gawain salutes in 
               answer.

               The two huge knights charge at each other, each man's spear 
               tip making contact with the other's armor, and in the violent 
               collision both are unhorsed. Lancelot is slower at getting 
               to his feet and drawing his sword.

               He is bleeding below the hauberk from his self-inflicted 
               wound.

               In the first onslaught Lancelot fights defensively, falling 
               back. He has to toss aside his shield and hold his stomach 
               with his shield hand.

               Morgana watches with Merlin. Every terrible blow of sword on 
               sword reverberates through her body pleasurable. Merlin is 
               captivated by her cruel sensuality.

               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - LATE DAY

               They swing and thrust at each other with slower but bone-
               crushing force, both unsteady now. Blood seeps from Lancelot's 
               feet, leaving awful footprints on the earth. Finally, with a 
               daring thrust, Lancelot lifts Gawain's visor and the sword 
               tip is before his eyes. Gawain drops his sword and shield, 
               kneels and speaks in a voice hoarse with weariness.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         The Queen is innocent. I yield to 
                         your mercy, Sir Lancelot.

               Lancelot collapses in a dead faint.

               INT. CELL, CAMELOT - EVENING

               Eyes closed, Lancelot lies on a bed, naked but for a cloth 
               across his loins. His minor wounds have been dressed, and 
               Merlin is kneading the huge gash in his stomach, working the 
               severed flesh together. Guenevere stands on one side of the 
               bed, Arthur on the other, both looking down upon Lancelot, 
               relieved and not daring to look at each other.

                                     MERLIN
                         Flesh on flesh. You must press on 
                         the wound, Guenevere, hold it, and 
                         it will begin to bind.

               Guenevere kneels, and at her touch Lancelot's eyes flicker 
               open. Merlin exits, and draws Arthur away with him.

               Arthur is deeply tormented.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere 
                         is returned to me...

                                     MERLIN
                         What is it my child?

               Merlin appears moved by the predicaments that Arthur has to 
               face.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Will I have a son?

               Merlin stares off into the evening sky, where a lark sings 
               high up.

                                     MERLIN
                         Yes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, 
                         nothing but a simple yes? That 
                         frightens me.

                                     MERLIN
                         A king should be afraid, always. The 
                         enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush 
                         in the dark corridors of his castle, 
                         on the deer paths of his forest, or 
                         in the gray and winding paths of a 
                         more tangled forest, in here.

               He taps his skull and smiles.

               INT. CELL - EVENING

               Lancelot is staring into Guenevere's eyes. She opens her 
               shift, baring a breast with the innocence of a mother 
               preparing to suckle a child. She presses her breast to his 
               wound, her face to his chest, her arms enfolding him. She 
               whispers.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Flesh on flesh. I will heal you.

               His body trembles and his eyes brim with tears. He is lost.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - NIGHT

               The court is assembled, for the evening feast. There is music 
               and heavy drinking. Some knights are slouched across the 
               table. Lancelot, still weak, takes his seat, looking at the 
               drunken and frivolous knights. Arthur catches it, and they 
               smile at each other.

                                     ARTHUR
                         They miss the battlefield. I think 
                         we do too.

                                     LANCELOT
                         But one can still keep a sword sharp 
                         riding out in the name of the King's 
                         law.

               Guenevere cannot tear her eyes from Lancelot. He avoids her 
               look. Arthur looks from Guenevere to Lancelot, and speaks 
               softly to him, across her, and with stabbing directness.

                                     ARTHUR
                         It is not easy for the young ones to 
                         learn knightly virtues without the 
                         hard teaching of war and quest. It 
                         is only your example, Lancelot, that 
                         binds them now.

               Then, addressing the hall:

                                     ARTHUR
                         Which is the greatest quality of 
                         knighthood? Courage? Compassion? 
                         Loyalty? Humility? What do you say, 
                         Merlin?

               He is bent close to Morgana, whispering. Only when the hall 
               rings with laughter does he look up.

                                     MERLIN
                         What?
                              (then seeing he has 
                              an audience)
                         The greatest? They blend together 
                         like the metals we mix to make a 
                         good sword.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I didn't ask for poetry. Which is 
                         it?

               Merlin looks from Arthur to Guenevere to Lancelot to Arthur.

                                     MERLIN
                         All right. Truth. It must be truth, 
                         above all. When a man lies he murders 
                         some part of the world.

               An uneasy silence falls upon the feast. Guenevere and Lancelot 
               cannot look at each other, and Arthur feels it. Lancelot 
               jumps to his feet.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Conversation and court life don't 
                         suit me. I must take my rest in the 
                         forest.

               Guenevere stifles her dismay.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?

                                     LANCELOT
                         It is deep...

               Arthur is about to rise to embrace him, but checks himself.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You will be sorely missed. Heal 
                         yourself and come back.

               The exchange has become closely intimate, even though they 
               stand apart and speak before everyone in the large hall. 
               Lancelot leaves. Only Guenevere cannot watch.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE -DAY

               Water gurgles from a rock that is captive in the roots of an 
               ancient oak. Lancelot, in armor, reclines against its trunk, 
               the roots cradling him. He is perfectly still, drawing life 
               from the vibrant, all-enfolding forest.

               Flower petals drift on the breeze. Trees sigh. Fox and rabbit, 
               sparrow and hawk, at peace with each other, watch over the 
               knight.

               EXT. FOREST -DAY

               A horse and rider tear through the thick undergrowth. It is 
               Guenevere. The forest races past her as she gallops toward 
               the glade, brambles tearing at her flesh and clothes.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE - DAY

               Lancelot gets to his feet, tense. Guenevere dismounts and 
               approaches. She is flushed and breathless from the wild race. 
               Her horse, left free, wanders over to his and grazes beside 
               it.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Why? You will destroy Arthur, and 
                         us...

               She moves closer and he thrusts out his mailed fist to keep 
               her away. She clutches it and presses the metal to her soft 
               tear-streaked cheek.

                                     LANCELOT
                         The law forbids it.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         Love demands it.

               Hungry with passion, she embraces the cold unmoving armor, 
               kissing it.

                                     LANCELOT
                         There are things about love--

                                     GUENEVERE
                         --Nothing!

               He steps back, drawing his sword. He holds it up by the blade 
               between them.

                                     LANCELOT
                         By my knight's sword, I swore faith--

               And before he can finish she grabs the blade to push it aside. 
               He holds it fast. Blood streams from her bare hands. He cannot 
               prevail without cutting them deeply. He lets go of the sword, 
               and she lets it fall to the ground.

               She embraces his still and defeated hulk. She kisses the 
               metal, and sensation shoots through him, dizzying him.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Guenevere...

               He folds her in his arm, and their bodies lock together as 
               though a trap had sprung. Their mouths meet, each devouring 
               the other...

               EXT. BATTLEMENTS, CAMELOT - DUSK

               Arthur and Merlin, the King desperate, the Wizard overwhelmed 
               by compassion:

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, 
                         by my beloved friend, by my knights. 
                         And by you. Perhaps most of all by 
                         you. For you made me, you forged 
                         this wretched life. And like a child 
                         tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a 
                         babbling lecher trotting after my 
                         sister...

                                     MERLIN
                         That is my destiny. I have a destiny, 
                         too...

                                     ARTHUR
                         With all your powers, you are content 
                         to be ridiculed, laughed at...

                                     MERLIN
                         My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to 
                         cheap tricks...
                              (with sudden enthusiasm)
                         Yes! I enjoy every moment of my 
                         foolishness, I join in the making of 
                         it, so no one can betray me. But 
                         you! You betray yourself.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Me? I have lived by the oath of king 
                         and knight.

                                     MERLIN
                         You betray the boy who drew the sword, 
                         the boy who saw the Dragon... the 
                         Dragon who moves close by, coiling 
                         and uncoiling, restless, looking 
                         down, waiting for the King to be a 
                         king...

               Arthur looks up and in the rolling clouds maybe, just maybe, 
               the form of a dragon is taking shape. Arthur draws Excalibur, 
               intensity animating his dead features.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I must do it myself. I must kill 
                         them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. 
                         Will you ride with me, Merlin?

                                     MERLIN
                         I cannot. I must not. Here I must 
                         stay.

               They embrace. Merlin is on the verge of tears, his face 
               immediately sad and finally ancient. Arthur exits.

               Morgana, who has been watching from the shadows, watching 
               from the shadows, slinks up to Merlin's side.

                                     MORGANA
                         Crazy old fool. You think yourself a 
                         kingmaker. Ha! A meddler, more likely. 
                         Look what a mess you've made of 
                         things.

               Merlin smiles knowingly at her.

                                     MERLIN
                         I? Perhaps, perhaps. I'm losing 
                         interest, Morgana... I have helped 
                         men--or meddled in their affairs, if 
                         you would have it that way--since 
                         the dawn of time. Now let them live 
                         by their own laws. Let them stand on 
                         their own feet. The gods of once are 
                         gone forever, it is time for men... 
                         Morgana, make a man out of me. Kiss 
                         me.

               He reaches to touch her lips. She cradles his hand in hers 
               and doesn't allow Merlin to kiss her. She kisses his knuckles 
               and stares into his eyes, stoking his desire.

                                     MORGANA
                         You know what I want. I want the 
                         secret of true magic, how to thicken 
                         the stuff of dreams and wishes with 
                         the flesh of the world.

                                     MERLIN
                         That I cannot.

               She breaks away, provocative, alluring.

                                     MORGANA
                         Then I will not.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Arthur and Sir Kay gallop through the forest, silently. It 
               is not a dream.  Their armor and the hooves of their horses 
               are muffled with pieces of cloth.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE - NIGHT

               Only Nature will ever see their love; the creatures of the 
               air, tree and ground witness the final reality of their 
               passion and sense its unfathomable depths, singing of it in 
               a hundred languages. Lancelot and Guenevere are naked and 
               interlocked, one being, suspended in the darkness in the eye 
               of the forest.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Arthur walks soundlessly through the trees, approaching the 
               glade. The forest falls suddenly silent.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE - NIGHT

               All passion spent, locked in each other's arms, Lancelot and 
               Guenevere drift off into sleep.

               Arthur comes upon them. He stands over them. He draws 
               Excalibur. Checking all emotion, he holds it above his head. 
               The ancient steel glows darkly.

               The lovers faces are serene and innocently beautiful. He 
               hesitates, tormented. His mask of anguish gives way to 
               determination and calm. He strikes the sword home, letting 
               go of it.

               He backs away, turns and disappears into the forest.

               EXT. FOREST GLADE - DAWN

               The sky is red; so is the steel of Excalibur. Lancelot awakens 
               and starts at what he sees. His cry stirs Guenevere. They 
               are horrified to see Excalibur impaled in the ground between 
               their entwined bodies. It has pierced their union without 
               grazing their flesh. They leap up and back away, unable to 
               speak at first.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Why didn't he kill us?

                                     GUENEVERE
                         He has given up.

               She kneels before the sword, embracing the hilt to her breast.

                                     LANCELOT
                         The King without his sword, the land 
                         without a king...

                                     GUENEVERE
                         We are to blame.

               Lancelot stumbles into the forest, berserk with guilt. He 
               rages against a small tree, crying out, and he rips its roots 
               from the ground, the terrible tearing and renting the symbol 
               of his own inner torment.

               Guenevere sinks to the ground next to Lancelot's empty armor 
               and his abandoned sword.

               INT. DUNGEONS OF CAMELOT

               Merlin and Morgana descend winding steps cut out of rock. 
               The only light comes from the glow of Merlin's staff.

                                     MERLIN
                         When Arthur built the castle, I carved 
                         out a place for myself, where I could 
                         laugh or sleep, and no one would 
                         bother me.

                                     MORGANA
                         People make you laugh?

               He laughs.

                                     MERLIN
                         They do.

                                     MORGANA
                         Why?

               He leans close to her ear, whispering into it.

                                     MERLIN
                         They don't know how close they live 
                         to the edge of delight or disas...

               He is about to kiss her when he slips. He laughs.

                                     MERLIN
                         Happiness or horror.

               INT. CAVE BENEATH CAMELOT

               They pass through jaws of stalactites and stalagmites. Merlin 
               cracks his staff whip-like and a ball of fire billows up 
               from the tip and illuminates a cave wildly veined and 
               filigreed with minerals and crusted with growths of crystals. 
               The light goes out but the malachite and the gold, the quartz, 
               diamond and beryllium burn dully. He turns to her, suddenly 
               tall and unstooped, younger, sleek and evil.

                                     MERLIN
                         In the folds of the earth where the 
                         forces that hold the world together 
                         are more alive, my power is strongest. 
                         Here I will possess you, as a man 
                         possesses a woman. And the god, the 
                         eunuch, the mule that I was, will be 
                         no more.

               He sweeps her up into his arms.

                                     MORGANA
                         You are truly magnificent!

                                     MERLIN
                         Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant 
                         of your stupid little games? Preying 
                         on you weakness of others. That's 
                         your power, a petty evil. Mine is 
                         great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. 
                         Laughable endings...

               He deposits her on bare rock. He kisses her. She pushes him 
               away.

                                     MORGANA
                         Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the 
                         true Name of the charms of Doing and 
                         Undoing. Show me!

                                     MERLIN
                         I won't. You would misuse such power. 
                         I have paid enough for you, and I 
                         will have you.

               She leans forward and kisses his ear and whispers.

                                     MORGANA
                         Make magic, my foolish wizard. For 
                         our love. Weave a marvelous room 
                         around us, a room worthy of our 
                         coupling.

               She draws closer, kissing him deeply. He breathes heavily.

                                     MERLIN
                         What do you want? You must desire it 
                         for me to weave it.

                                     MORGANA
                         Walls of shining crystals, burning 
                         with red fire, furnishings of metals 
                         and jewels never seen by man...

               Morgana falls silent as Merlin raises a hand, majestically 
               intoning a harsh repetitive charm. The mineral veins of the 
               cave begin to glow and fog seeps out from them enveloping 
               the couple.

                                     MERLIN
                         Desire it and it will be as you 
                         desire.

               Morgana burns with intensity. Merlin utters a formula and 
               the fog coalesces around them into the shimmering presence 
               of crystal walls, fountains raining jewels, flowers made of 
               scented air, a bed of glass shot with light and covered with 
               skins of animals dead before the time of man, goblets of 
               ruby, tapestries woven of golden hair. She reaches out to 
               touch the wall and her hand plunges through the unmaterialized 
               illusion.

                                     MORGANA
                         It's only a semblance. You disappoint 
                         me.

               She begins lacing up her loosened gown.

                                     MERLIN
                         Don't touch the walls. Come close to 
                         me.

               She does, a mad hope in her eyes. She kisses his chest.

                                     MORGANA
                         Do it, Merlin, the deepest secret. 
                         Fix it with the charm of Making, for 
                         our endless pleasure.

               He utters the ancient charm, Morgana listening closely, 
               memorizing it. The illusion is all of a sudden solid.

                                     MERLIN
                         For you...

               She runs her hand across the hard crystal surface, her eyes 
               gleaming.

               From outside the wondrous room they can be seen to embrace. 
               He carries her to the magical bed where he makes love to 
               her, as they disappear from view in its effulgent light.

               She comes out through the crystal door, burning with evil 
               intent. She turns to watch him asleep in the bed.

               She utters the charm of Summoning learnt from Merlin, and 
               the room melts into an eddying carmine fog. Within it, Merlin 
               struggles to awaken from the torpor of love, alarmed.

               Outside, Morgana utters the charm of Making and the gaseous 
               mass begins to crystallize.

               Inside, Merlin is rising to his feet, breathing the red fog, 
               his movements slowing to a standstill, his mouth opening in 
               a scream of horror.

               The cloud has metamorphosed into a magnificent cluster of 
               red crystals.  Morgana peers into its facets and there she 
               sees, in fragments, Merlin's terror... an eye, the gaping 
               mouth, a clawing hand--as he is entombed in the stone. She 
               laughs in triumph.

               EXT. FOREST - CAMELOT - DAY

               Surrounded by forest, the spires and battlements of Camelot 
               rise under black storm clouds. Arthur and Kay ride back to 
               the castle.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - DAY

               The great hall is in gloom. Few knights are in attendance at 
               the table.

               Some sleep off last night's wine. Arthur approaches, haggard, 
               searching.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Has no one seen Merlin?

               Knights look up; those who meet Arthur's reddened eyes shake 
               their heads.

               Arthur leaves. A knight whispers to another.

                                     KNIGHT
                         Did you see? The King was without 
                         Excalibur...

               INT. PASSAGEWAYS, CAMELOT - DAY

               Echoing in the vaulted corridors outside the hall, the 
               knight's whisper stabs Arthur.

               The words now seem borne on the whistling wind and follow 
               the King wherever he goes in search of Merlin. He comes upon 
               a knight seducing a lady in a dark corner by the chapel door, 
               his hand under her gown. Arthur notes the sacrilege in 
               silence, and continues on his way.

               INT. BEDCHAMBER - DAY

               The wind keens. Thunder rolls overhead. Arthur enters his 
               bedchamber. He sits by the empty fireplace, a broken man. 
               Feminine hands light on his shoulders. He starts. He looks 
               up. It is Morgana. He smiles and grasps her hand.

                                     MORGANA
                         I'll weep for you, brother, for a 
                         King must not weep.

               She comes around and she kneels in front of him. Before he 
               can talk she silences him with a tender caress.

                                     MORGANA
                         Do you know what Guenevere's maids 
                         have whispered?

               He shakes his head.

                                     MORGANA
                         That when the King returned from 
                         battle...

               She begins untying the laces of his metal thigh and shin 
               guards.

                                     MORGANA
                         ...Guenevere would unlace his armor 
                         and massage the burns where metal 
                         rubbed on flesh...

               She is stripping his legs naked, gently touching the flesh 
               with her fingertips. He stares off, remembering.

                                     MORGANA
                         ...She would prepare a bath for you, 
                         mixing special ointment in the 
                         water...

               Arthur's eyes brim with tears. Morgana weeps, embracing his 
               knees. He rests his hand gently upon her head, choked with 
               remembrance, soothing her. But as she weeps, she incants a 
               charm.

               Arthur looks down upon her, and the woman who looks up at 
               him is Guenevere, a Guenevere with cold ice eyes. He is made 
               weak by desire and weakened further by magic. He holds her 
               face adoringly.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Guenevere! You are--

                                     "GUENEVERE"
                         --Don't speak. A thousand words, a 
                         hundred thousand words, would only 
                         be prologue to the truth that must 
                         be. That you, King, and I, your Queen, 
                         beget a son to bond our love and to 
                         strengthen our weak kingdom with a 
                         successor. Come, my lord...

               She draws him to the floor and upon her body, holding him 
               tightly to himself. Arthur trembles with excitement, pathetic 
               in his desperate passion.

               As he takes her, she shudders, losing control of the charm, 
               and her features change till once again "Guenevere" is 
               Morgana. She holds him in a tight embrace so that he may not 
               see her. She whispers in his ear.

                                     MORGANA
                         The moon flows in my blood to meet 
                         your seed. And already I bear him 
                         who will be King.

               Arthur wrenches himself away so he can see her, her arms 
               still around his neck. He looks down upon her, aghast, 
               incredulous.

                                     MORGANA
                         I could easily kill you, brother. 
                         But I want you to live to see our 
                         son be King. In me, the blood of 
                         Cornwall will have its revenge; in 
                         me, the blood of Uther will show its 
                         dark side.

               She presses her thumbs into his neck and he faints.

               EXT. FOREST - CAMELOT - DAY

               Morgana, with a small party, rides away from the castle 
               through the lashing storm, till they are taken from sight in 
               the folds of the forest...

               INT. CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               Lightening forks across the sky, illuminating the interior. 
               The chapel has been transformed into a place of satanic 
               worship. Held up and surrounded by hooded figures, Morgana 
               lies on the altar, her pregnant belly huge; and her features 
               are fierce with passionate intensity. She writhes in the 
               pangs of childbirth.

                                     MORGANA
                         Stand back, all of you. Through my 
                         own body I have nurtured him with my 
                         potions. I made him. I alone can 
                         give him life.

               INT. CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT

               Arthur enters, pale and haunted. Mass is being celebrated, 
               and some knights are present. Those not asleep whisper to 
               each other about the King. The sound of an approaching storm 
               is heard.

               As the priest raises the chalice to consecrate the wine. 
               Arthur comes down the aisle and steps onto the altar. He 
               reaches out to grasp the chalice from the priest's hands.

               INT. CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT

               Morgana holds aloft her beautiful newborn baby, his body 
               glistening in a flash of lightening. She is triumphant.

               INT. CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT.

               A bolt of lightening strikes the chalice, rocking the chapel, 
               and Arthur is knocked back violently.

               Rain lashes in through the shattered window upon the terrified 
               knights. They and the priest back away. Arthur is left alone. 
               He rises and goes to the chalice, which is bent and cracked. 
               He kneels before it. Steam hisses up as rain falls on it.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - DAY

               Sun streams in. Many of the knights are in attendance, in 
               full armor.

               Ladies and pages watch from dark corners. Arthur addresses 
               the fellowship.

               He holds the cracked chalice in his hands. He burns with a 
               new-found fervor.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Who will ride the labyrinths of the 
                         forest, to the very root of his soul, 
                         to the very ends of the earth, to 
                         find the secret that will redeem us 
                         from the evil that has fallen upon 
                         us, and make this chalice, and 
                         ourselves, whole again?

               Gawain rises and draws his sword in salute.

                                     SIR GAWAIN
                         I will ride forth in the name of 
                         that quest, and commit my strength 
                         and my soul to it.

               Perceval, Kay and a few others draw their swords and touch 
               their lips to the blades in oath. Sunbeams splash off their 
               armor.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I will go.

               The rest of the fellowship draw their swords in imitation, 
               but the resolution within them is not strong. Arthur comes 
               forward to Gawain.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, 
                         that we may never meet again, that 
                         the fellowship will be no more...

               He embraces Gawain, tears in his eyes. He turns to Perceval, 
               and Perceval kneels.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         We will find the secret or die.

               Arthur kisses the young knight's brow. Then he turns to Kay.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Kay, I know your heart yearns to go, 
                         but I am prisoner to my duties, and 
                         you must be to yours, at my side.

               Arthur and Kay watch the knights file out till the hall is 
               empty, the harsh song of their armor growing distant.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A LEGEND APPEARS:

               "For nine years they searched. Morgana's power grew in the 
               land."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. SNOWSCAPE - DAY

               Under a leaden sky, Gawain drives his horse through swirling 
               snow. He comes upon a mounted knight who is frozen in his 
               tracks. He brushes the snow from the man's face. The frozen 
               features belong to Caradoc. He slowly continues on his way.

               EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY

               Dangling from the branches of a dead tree are a dozen dead 
               knights of the Round Table, crows pecking at the rotting 
               flesh in the chinks of armor. Perceval rides up, cries out 
               in horror, and spurs his horse away.

               EXT. MOORS - DAY

               The rotting carcasses of sheep. The crops blackened and 
               withered on the stalk. Hungry peasants head for a distant 
               hill.

               EXT, HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY

               A giant head has been carved out of an outcrop of rock, its 
               stone mouth gaping toward the sky.

               People are congregated around the mouth. Peasants and farmers, 
               they are wild with excitement, responding to drums throbbing 
               and bagpipes wailing.

               They watch Morgana, who is surrounded by knights in dark 
               armor. At her side is an angelic boy of eight, his eyes cold 
               as his mother's. Morgana is more beautiful than ever, in 
               flowing druidic robes, the gossamer silk clinging to her 
               sweat-drenched body.

               She is standing by the deep hole which forms the giant's 
               open mouth. It is covered by a tooth-like grating acting as 
               a drain for the blood of human sacrifices made there. Before 
               her is Gawain, chained and struggling against five strong 
               men who hold him. Morgana lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               Gawain's chest. The fountain of blood that gushes from the 
               great knight's body drives the crowd into a frenzy.

                                     MORGANA
                              (intoning)
                         The blood of this knight will feed 
                         the god in the earth, he is weak 
                         with hunger, and he will be made 
                         strong by this blood. Then he will 
                         plant his seed, and the land will be 
                         fertile once again.

               Gawain, his blood flowing from him and into the giant's mouth, 
               looks up in anguish. His bellowing voice is echoed and 
               amplified by the hollow beneath the drain.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Arthur, forgive me. I die without 
                         the secret. I have failed.

               EXT. MOORS - DAY

               Gawain's death cry and the din of the ritual carries to 
               Perceval's ears as he wanders through the wasteland. He draws 
               down his visor and spurs his horse forward.

               EXT. HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY

               He gallops toward the giant's head. He checks his sword and 
               lowers his lance.

               The knight charging forward on his war horse is an awesome 
               sight, but the crowd around the giant's mouth is strangely 
               unfrightened. Morgana is excited; she turns to the boy.

                                     MORGANA
                         Look, Mordred, a true prize for the 
                         giant. The lamb rides into our jaws.

               Perceval is galloping toward them when the ground gives way 
               beneath the horse, and he and the animal plunge into a pit. 
               The cheering crowd rushes to the edge of the trap.

                                     MORGANA
                              (to Mordred)
                         You must kill him, for this knight 
                         is dear to your father. You must do 
                         it and learn to enjoy your father's 
                         pain.

               Her knights drag Perceval, unarmed, into Morgana's presence.

                                     MORGANA
                         Have you found what you search for? 
                         Have you found what Arthur seeks?

               Perceval doesn't answer, defiant and hiding his fear.

                                     MORGANA
                         You haven't, or you would be smiling 
                         now in the face of death. Your quest 
                         is an impossible one.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         That it might be impossible makes it 
                         all the more necessary.

                                     MORGANA
                         Fool!
                              (to the men holding 
                              Perceval)
                         Uncover him. I'll show you the mystery 
                         of life. It's death...
                              (to Mordred)
                         Do it, Mordred!

               Holding Perceval by his limbs and hair, the men force him 
               down on the bloody grating, drawing back his head, exposing 
               his throat. Morgana kneels by his head, and draws the boy 
               beside her. She holds the tip of the dagger to Perceval's 
               neck and takes Mordred's hand and wraps it around the handle.  
               Perceval is choked with fear, his heart pounding in his 
               throat.

                                     MORGANA
                         Feel the life through the dagger, 
                         child. It belongs to you.

               The boy looks up at his mother. The vein in Perceval's neck 
               pushes against the dagger's point.

                                     MORDRED
                         I feel it, Mother. I will give his 
                         blood to the giant.

               The boy raises the dagger, and hesitates just a bit. Perceval 
               resigns himself bravely. He looks the child calmly in the 
               eye. Mordred brings down the blade without strength, just 
               piercing the skin with the tip. He lets go of the dagger, 
               afraid now of his mistake.

               The dagger clatters to the grating and slips away down the 
               drain, before Morgana can retrieve it. She rages against 
               Mordred. In the confusion, Perceval tears loose, the men 
               holding him slipping on the blood-wet stone.

               Perceval runs through the crowd. Immediately, lance lowered, 
               a knight is upon him. Perceval leaps toward him, catching 
               the lance in his hand, and pulling down the rider with it. 
               He jumps the rider and draws the knight's sword. Whirling 
               the lance and cutting the air with the sword, he keeps back 
               the other knights for a moment, giving him time to see his 
               chance. He leaps onto the riderless horse and charges off 
               through the crowd. He reins in abruptly, the horse rearing. 
               He is wary of the ground before him; there could be a hidden 
               pit. But there is no time to think. Knights and men on foot 
               are rushing him. He spurs forward into a gallop, the horse 
               striding mightily And its hind leg sinks into a pit, the 
               animal losing its gait. But the momentum carries the horse 
               forward, and it recovers from the stumble.

               Perceval gallops away.

               Morgana is enraged. She shakes Mordred by the hair.

                                     MORGANA
                         You didn't kill him! You didn't kill 
                         him!

               But suddenly she begins kissing him tenderly.

                                     MORGANA
                         My dear, sweet boy...

               He just stands there emotionless, the dead center of her 
               turbulent passions.

               EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY

               Perceval gallops down a trail. The black-armored knights of 
               Morgana chase him.

               Perceval reins into deep cover alongside the trail. The 
               pursuers thunder past and the sound of hooves recedes. 
               Perceval checks his newly found sword, slashes the air to 
               feel the weapon's balance. He re-sheathes it. He pats the 
               horse.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         We'll become good friends.

               He starts off again, into the patchless forest of dead trees.

               He is suddenly set upon by a wildman who, swinging a small 
               uprooted tree, knocks him off his horse. Perceval crashes to 
               the ground and before he can use his sword the wildman has 
               knocked it out of his hand.

               It is Lancelot, demented, who furiously rains battering blows 
               on Perceval's armor, bellowing with rage. All that Perceval 
               can do is attempt to avoid the blows. Lancelot addresses 
               Perceval as if the young knight were Lancelot himself.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Where are you going, Lancelot, in 
                         your iron tomb? Still trying to save 
                         the world?
                              (He hammers blows 
                              into Perceval's armor)
                         The best... the bravest... the 
                         greatest... fool that ever lived. 
                         Now the world rots. Death is king of 
                         the earth. And it is you who make it 
                         so, Lancelot.

               Before Perceval can speak, Lancelot disappears again into 
               the forest, his eyes blank, as though his encounter with the 
               young knight had never happened.

               A knot of pain, Perceval pulls himself up. He tries to rise 
               into the saddle. He is too hurt to do it. He starts off on 
               foot, slowly, leading the horse.

               EXT. DEAD FOREST AND STREAM - NIGHT

               It is very dark and Perceval has to feel his way.

               He comes to the edge of a stream. He kneels to drink, and 
               the horse drinks beside him. Then he rests back on his heels, 
               brooding, too tired to rise.

               He lowers his eyes, staring into the dark water, defeated, 
               empty.

               Before him in the water a long thin bar of light appears. He 
               looks at it amazed. Voices are heard singing very far away. 
               He reaches out to touch the long strip of light but his hand 
               just disturbs the water. It is a reflection. The strip grows 
               wider and the ethereal music is closer.

               Perceval looks up. The strip of light is before him, 
               suspended, thirty feet above. It continues to grow wider. A 
               drawbridge is being slowly lowered, allowing a powerful light 
               to escape from within.

               Perceval is terrified. In pain, he slowly rises into the 
               saddle, ready to gallop off; but fascinated, hypnotized by 
               the sight, he cannot, and he stays and watches.

               The dim outline of a castle becomes visible as the drawbridge 
               is lowered across the water to the ground at his feet. At 
               the center of the blast of light coming from the castle, 
               Perceval can make out a burning chalice. The music swells to 
               a terrifying pitch, searing the forest.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO CASTLE - NIGHT

               At the sight of the chalice, Perceval masters his fear. Bathed 
               in light and music, he spurs the horse forward onto the 
               drawbridge.

               Once he is on it, the bridge begins to rise. Unsure of its 
               footing and blinded by the light, the horse becomes skittish, 
               and Perceval has to struggle to control it. He dismounts to 
               lead it, but the horse is terrified, rears up and jumps off 
               the bridge, which continues to rise, drawn up by unseen hands.

               Perceval hesitates, then advances down the sloping drawbridge 
               into the castle courtyard. All details are bleached out by 
               the blinding light. The chalice appears suspended in space, 
               and now the figure of a man can be glimpsed standing behind 
               it.

               Enchanting music from unseen singers grows and weaves. 
               Perceval looks back to see the drawbridge slowly closing, 
               trapping him inside.

               He approaches the figure, his courage ebbing. Hands cupping 
               the chalice, it speaks to him.

                                     FIGURE
                         What is the secret of the chalice? 
                         Who does it serve?

               Perceval doesn't understand. He glances back again. The 
               drawbridge is nearly closed. Terror seizes him.

               Panicked, puzzled, baffled, he backs away. He scrambles up 
               the drawbridge desperate to reach the top before it closes. 
               He claws his way up till his hand grasps the top. He heaves 
               himself through the narrow closing slit which is about to 
               crush him. He screams, and with a final effort he wriggles 
               free and topples over crashing into the water below.

               EXT. DEAD FOREST AND STREAM - NIGHT

               He looks up. The drawbridge thunders shut, the last thin 
               strip of light disappearing; and now he is surrounded only 
               by the silence of the forest.

               Where there was a castle, now there is darkness. Perceval 
               wades through the water. He has crossed the stream and all 
               he can see and feel are tree trunks. The castle has 
               disappeared. He is utterly defeated.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         The chalice. The secret was in my 
                         grasp. I let it slip, afraid for 
                         myself. A question was asked. I didn't 
                         understand. I didn't try. I failed...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A LEGEND APPEARS:

               "Nine years passed."

               FADE IN:

               INT. CAVE BENEATH CAMELOT.

               Dripping water is steadily encrusting the crystal with 
               limestone.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - DAY

               Dead knights lay on biers. The once glorious seat of power 
               is falling into decay. Few are in attendance around the table. 
               Agitated, Kay enters and goes to Arthur, who is worn and 
               haggard, and aged.

                                     KAY
                         Your son Mordred is at the gate.

               Arthur comes alive.

                                     ARTHUR
                         At last...

                                     KAY
                         Don't recognize him. You were trapped 
                         by Morgana's sorcery.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (staring off)
                         ...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and 
                         Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all 
                         the others--lost to me. Only the 
                         echo of their voices remains in this 
                         empty hall. All I have left is the 
                         memory of their fellowship. Echoes 
                         and memories. I am a ghost of the 
                         King that once was...
                              (he turns to Kay and 
                              with sudden harshness)
                         ...Mordred is real, alive, my own 
                         flesh and blood. I will see him, I 
                         must.

               EXT. GATE, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAY

               The drawbridge lowers slowly, and Arthur moves away from Kay 
               and the other knights, and advances across it.

               Rooks wheel over the dead trees of the forest that surrounds 
               Camelot. A group of armed men waits at the edge of the forest. 
               One steps forward, a huge knight in black armor, the metal 
               defining and exaggerating the powerful musculature of his 
               body. He is Mordred, a young man of eighteen, and of 
               extraordinary beauty. A page follows ten steps behind him 
               bearing an enormous spear, its points hooded. Arthur stops 
               at the edge of the drawbridge, the huge knight a few steps 
               from him. Kay, ready for anything, moves halfway across the 
               drawbridge.

               Mordred kneels on one knee.

                                     MORDRED
                         Father...

                                     ARTHUR
                         Rise, Mordred.

                                     MORDRED
                         I have come to claim what is mine, 
                         Father.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I recognize you only as my son, no 
                         more.

                                     MORDRED
                              (his tone is scathing)
                         And you are the great King? The lords 
                         have rebelled. Invaders attack the 
                         coasts. Crops don't grow. There is 
                         nothing but plague and hunger in the 
                         land. Only I am feared. I will be 
                         king. You may have lost Excalibur, 
                         but I have found my own weapon of 
                         power. There.

               He points to the huge lance. The page pulls a string and the 
               hood drops, revealing a diabolically sharp spear tip, its 
               metal glinting menacingly.

                                     MORDRED
                         The very spear that pierced the side 
                         of Christ as he died on the cross.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Your mother told you that?

               Mordred is thrown off by the doubt Arthur has cast. Arthur 
               looks upon his son, desperately trying to read him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I cannot offer you the land, only my 
                         love...

                                     MORDRED
                         And I offer only this, Father. To 
                         commit with passion and pleasure all 
                         the evils that you failed to commit, 
                         as man and king.

               Arthur goes forward to embrace his son, a desperate attempt. 
               Mordred recoils.

                                     MORDRED
                         We will embrace only in battle. 
                         Father, and I will touch you only 
                         with the blade of my spear.

               Arthur is on the verge of tears.

                                     MORDRED
                         I will muster a great force of 
                         knights, and I will return to fight 
                         for what is mine.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So be it.

               He turns and re-enters the castle, the drawbridge pulled up 
               immediately behind him. He is hunched over, broken.

               EXT. BARREN LAND - EVENING

               Asleep in the saddle, Perceval rides across burnt and 
               smoldering fields. The horse walks aimlessly; it is the same 
               animal, mangy and old. A hoard of children in filthy rags 
               closes in on him, begging, pulling at the horse's trappings. 
               He bolts awake and reins away. His eyes are red and feverish.

               Wild hope grips him when he sees a glinting light by a 
               farmhouse. He spurs the horse forward into a gallop.

               EXT. FARM - EVENING

               He leaps from the saddle and a terrified woman backs away. 
               Perceval plunges his hand into the source of light. It is 
               nothing but the reflection of the dying sun in a bucketful 
               of water. Perceval covers his face.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Illusions. I will never find it 
                         again... I am sorry, woman, that I 
                         frightened you.

               Peasants have emerged, surrounding him, and they hold axes 
               and pitchforks.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Good woman, do you have any food? 
                         Some water?...

                                     PEASANT
                         The little we had, we gave to 
                         Mordred's knights. He has taken this 
                         land. Tell the King that now we must 
                         look to Mordred.

                                     SECOND PEASANT
                         But we will give you some water...

               At least ten peasants encircle Perceval and he is too 
               exhausted to put up a fight. They grab him and carry him 
               away. Other peasants pull his horse to the ground, and one 
               raises and ax to kill it.

               EXT. STREAM, BARREN LAND - EVENING

               They throw Perceval down an escarpment and he rolls into the 
               fast-moving water. He is swept downstream and thrown 
               ferociously against the rocks in the stream bed, crying out 
               in pain.

               EXT. RIVER AND UNDERWATER - EVENING

               The water is deeper and Perceval is dragged under by the 
               weight of his armor. He struggles desperately to shed it, 
               half drowning.

               Exhausted, he pulls himself up onto the muddy shore beside a 
               rotting sheep carcass, and around him, the daylight dies.

               EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

               Ragged and bruised, lifeless, he stares into space.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I have lost my horse, my armor, my 
                         sword. I have lost my way. I have 
                         lost my strength. I have lost 
                         everything... I will not lose hope.

               A light bursting through the trees shines on the mud, 
               wordless, harmonies sound somewhere in the forest. Perceval 
               sets off toward the source.

               The burning light blasts into his face but he doesn't flinch. 
               The chorus builds in power. Before him, a drawbridge lowers.

               EXT. CASTLE GATE - NIGHT

               He steps onto the bridge and walks in. He crosses the 
               courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him. All details 
               of the castle are bleached out by the searing light.

               EXT. CASTLE GATE - NIGHT

               He steps onto the bridge and walks in. He crosses the 
               courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him. All details 
               of the castle are bleached out by the searing light.

               INT. CASTLE, VARIOUS

               Heading for the source of the light he ascends what seem to 
               be a staircase. He enters a hall where the chalice stands 
               suspended, burning with light, and the mysterious music swirls 
               and grows.

               Perceval approaches the diaphanous and featureless Figure 
               who stands over the chalice.

                                     FIGURE
                         Who does it serve?

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You, my lord.

                                     FIGURE
                         I have waited long for you. Once you 
                         almost saw, but fear blinded you. 
                         Why am I served from the chalice?

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Because you and the land are one.

                                     FIGURE
                         I am wasting away and I cannot die. 
                         And I cannot live.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You and the land are one. Drink from 
                         the chalice. You will be reborn and 
                         the land with you.

               Perceval cups his hands around the chalice to lift it. But 
               they close on nothing, and he draws back. The Figure's hands, 
               although insubstantial, grasp Perceval's and appear to hold 
               his hands around the cup.

                                     FIGURE
                         But who am I?

               Perceval begins to kneel.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         You are my lord and King. You are 
                         Arthur.

               The blinding light vanishes, the music drifts away.

               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - NIGHT

               Perceval falls to his knees before Arthur and he holds the 
               chalice, now whole again, up to the King. It fills with blood 
               from within and Arthur takes it from Perceval. He drinks. 
               And having done so, he seems to become younger and to grow 
               in strength.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I didn't know how empty was my soul 
                         until it was filled.

               Sir Kay stands by the vast fireplace where a small fire burns, 
               and only now looks up and is aware of Perceval.

                                     KAY
                         Perceval, you have returned!

                                     ARTHUR
                         Ready my knights for battle; they 
                         will ride with their King once more. 
                         I have lived through others far too 
                         long! Lancelot carried my honor and 
                         Guenevere my guilt. My knights have 
                         fought my causes. Mordred carries my 
                         sins. Now, at last, I will rule.

               EXT. WOODS AND FIELDS - NIGHT

               Arthur at the head of a small force of knights, their armor 
               shining beneath the moon, gallops through the land. Where 
               hooves thunder, the ground becomes alive with sprouts and 
               tendrils, and bare trees start to bud, and grasses to blossom, 
               the power of Nature exploding into life.

               INT. CONVENT - DAWN

               An old nun approaches the doors, upon which someone is 
               pounding loudly. She opens the peephole. It is Arthur.

                                     NUN
                         Go away. No man is allowed beyond 
                         these doors.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am Arthur.

               The old nun is amazed and starts pushing open the many bolts, 
               mumbling and agitated.

               INT. CONVENT COURTYARD - DAWN

               She leads the King, his footsteps ringing in the silent 
               cloister, past the doors to the cells. His armor is wet with 
               dew and it shines with a dull and deep luster. Nuns whisper 
               at his transit. She opens the door to a cell and Arthur steps 
               inside.

               INT. CELL - DAWN

               Candles flicker on a small altar before which a nun is 
               praying. She turns to see who has entered. It is Guenevere, 
               older, thin with self-denial, all the more beautiful. She 
               looks up at the majestic figure who stands before her. She 
               nearly swoons. He helps her to her feet, and words rush from 
               deep within him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Guenevere, accept my forgiveness, 
                         and put your heart to rest. We have 
                         suffered to long. I have always loved 
                         you, and I still love you.

               She weeps.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         I loved you much, as King, and 
                         sometimes as husband, but one cannot 
                         gaze too long at the sun in the sky.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I 
                         was not born to live a man's life, 
                         but to be the stuff of future memory. 
                         The fellowship was a brief beginning, 
                         a fair time that cannot be forgotten; 
                         and because it will not be forgotten, 
                         that fair time may come again. Now 
                         once more I must ride with my knights 
                         to defend what was, and the dream of 
                         what could be.

                                     GUENEVERE
                         I have kept it.

               She draws back the covers of her pallet, and there is 
               Excalibur. Arthur is overwhelmed by emotion; he can barely 
               speak

                                     ARTHUR
                         I never dared to hope all these years 
                         that it was in your keeping.

               He kneels before her and kisses her thigh. She gazes off, 
               remembering the life of long ago. He rises and looks off 
               into her eyes, unable to find the words; he finally does.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I have often thought that in the 
                         hereafter of our lives, when I owe 
                         no more to the future and can be 
                         just a man, that we may meet, and 
                         you will come to me and claim me as 
                         yours, and know that I am your 
                         husband. It is a dream I have...

               He takes Excalibur by the hilt and exits.

               INT. CONVENT COURTYARD - DAWN

               The nuns scatter before him in awe and terror. He strides 
               forward, Excalibur in hand. He stops and tests its balance, 
               and he draws force from it.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Guenevere...

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               Excalibur gleams in the sunlight. Arthur holds it high, at 
               the head of a small force of knights under the banner of the 
               Dragons. Kay and Perceval ride at his side. Plumed helmets, 
               shields blazing with armorial colors, pennants flying in the 
               clean wind from their lances; it is a brave sight. The trees 
               are in blossom and dandelion fluff billows up at their 
               passage.

               EXT. PIT, MOORS - DAY

               Arthur's group comes to a halt. Two knights and a few squires 
               galloping from the opposite direction rein in before the 
               King. The knights draw their swords in homage, and the older 
               one addresses Arthur.

                                     KNIGHT
                         It is only me and my son. All other 
                         knights of the dukedom have rallied 
                         to Mordred.

               Arthur smiles hiding the hurt. He points to an open pit, a 
               huge devastation.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What horror is that?

                                     KNIGHT
                         Mordred, sir. He digs for precious 
                         metals, with which he buys the loyalty 
                         of men at arms, binding them to his 
                         side.

               EXT. THE MOORS - ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - LATE EVENING

               It is a clear night and the sky blazes with stars. A crescent 
               moon casts its silvery light upon Arthur, who wanders from 
               his camp alone.

               EXT. STONEHENGE, THE MOORS - LATE EVENING

               He stops in the ancient circle of Druidic stones.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I am outnumbered ten to one by 
                         Mordred's forces. Merlin, I need you 
                         at my side as you were once, my 
                         friend, to give me courage. There 
                         are no war tricks that will fool 
                         Mordred. He was weaned on blood.

               He falls on his knees in front of the stone, tired, between 
               thinking and dreaming, and he bangs his mailed fist against 
               it.

                                     ARTHUR
                         More than I ever did, I need you 
                         now. Where are you, Merlin? Is it 
                         true that Morgana has trapped you?

               INT. CAVE BELOW CAMELOT

               The veins of crystal glow darkly, and the hammering of 
               Arthur's fist upon the stone is dimly echoed here. In the 
               red crystal, fragments of Merlin can be glimpsed, trapped, 
               frozen.

               EXT. STONEHENGE - LATE EVENING

               Arthur slips off into sleep. The stones around him distort. 
               He speaks softly, but then though the words continue, his 
               lips are closed.

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...If only you could be at my side, 
                         Merlin, to see me wield Excalibur 
                         once more...

               INT. CAVE BELOW CAMELOT

               The crystal is cracking, shards falling to the cave floor.

               EXT. STONEHENGE - NIGHT

               Arthur is still on his knees, and he sits back, looking up. 
               But the atmosphere is different, within a dream, and the 
               stones of the henge loom larger over him now.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What is this place? It is rumored 
                         Merlin, that you drew your power 
                         from these circles...

               A hand ruffles the King's hair. He turns, and is face to 
               face with Merlin, standing over him. Arthur looks at him 
               without surprise, as though the intervening years never were. 
               Merlin begins to laugh his hideous giggle. Arthur rises.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they 
                         must fight tomorrow for their very 
                         lives.

                                     MERLIN
                         I know. I have heard noises and echoes 
                         through the stones...

                                     ARTHUR
                         What is this place, Merlin?

                                     MERLIN
                         It is like a tree. The roots of the 
                         stones spread out across the land 
                         and they draw on the thoughts and 
                         actions of men. Like sap those human 
                         matters course through the stones 
                         feeding the stars that are the leaves 
                         of the tree. And the stars whisper 
                         back to men the future course of 
                         events.
                              (becoming passionate)
                         But the earth is being torn apart, 
                         its metals stolen, and the balance 
                         is broken and the lines of power no 
                         longer converge. In fact, I nearly 
                         didn't make it in one piece.

               He limps affectedly and stretches with exaggerated pain.

                                     MERLIN
                         But, I'm here.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Where have you been these many years? 
                         Is it true that Morgana--

                                     MERLIN
                         --Stories... You brought me back. 
                         Your love brought me back. Back to 
                         where you are now, in the land of 
                         dreams...

                                     ARTHUR
                         Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!

               Merlin smiles, turns and leaves, heading for Arthur's camp, 
               giggling. Arthur starts off after him and awakens from the 
               dream when he walks into one of the stones. It takes him a 
               moment to realize that Merlin has vanished.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Merlin?!

               He hurries away toward the camp.

               INT. KAY'S TENT, ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               Arthur shakes Kay awake, and as the faithful knight comes 
               out of a deep sleep, he clutches Arthur's arm.

                                     KAY
                         Merlin, will I live...?
                              (he shakes away the 
                              dream)
                         ...I was dreaming...

                                     ARTHUR
                         Of Merlin?

                                     KAY
                         Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would 
                         fight bravely tomorrow. I have never 
                         dreamed of Merlin before.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! 
                         He lives in our dreams now, in that 
                         dark and shadowy place that is as 
                         strong and real as this more solid 
                         one. He speaks to us from there.

               EXT. MORDRED'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               Cape flowing, Merlin sweeps between Mordred's war tents, and 
               in the logic of dreams, unseen by the guards. He passes a 
               tent where the huge shadow of Mordred is thrown on the canvas, 
               as he sharpens the blade of a fearsome spear.

               He enters a tent.

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

               She is stunningly beautiful in her sleep. Merlin leans over 
               her lovely body, kisses her softly on the lips, and waits 
               for her to awaken.

                                     MERLIN
                         I have returned, enchantress. You 
                         are beautiful, magnificent. Have you 
                         used up all the magic you stole from 
                         me to keep yourself young? Have you 
                         any magic left to do battle with 
                         Merlin?

               INT. TENT - MORGANA'S DREAM

               She rises from her sleeping body.

                                     MORGANA
                         You provoke me, Merlin.

                                     MERLIN
                         What's behind that beauty? A wizened, 
                         cold-hearted snake.

               Merlin steps back, grandiose and melodramatic.

                                     MERLIN
                         You are a snake about to strike!

               He raises his staff.

                                     MERLIN
                         And I am the staff that drives the 
                         snake back.

               He lowers the staff with dreamlike slowness and she slinks 
               right up to him.

                                     MORGANA
                         Burning with the fire of desire, I 
                         am the flames that consume the staff 
                         to ashes.

               She winds her fluttering hands around the staff, and the 
               shadows they cast upon the tent give the illusion of licking 
               flames.

                                     MERLIN
                         I am the cloudburst that quenches 
                         the flames.

                                     MORGANA
                         I am the desert, where water 
                         disappears--

                                     MERLIN
                         --I am the sea, which covers the 
                         desert forever under its weight.

                                     MORGANA
                         --I am the fog and mists that rise 
                         up from the sea, escaping...

               She laughs at her cleverness.

                                     MERLIN
                         Fog and mist! You couldn't be that. 
                         You don't have enough magic.

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

               Morgana tosses and mutters in her tormented dream.

                                     MORGANA
                         ...I have the desire and I have the 
                         magic...

               INT. TENT - MORGANA'S DREAM

               Merlin, huge, magnetic, enfolds Morgana in his cape.

                                     MERLIN
                         You are mine at last. I am the sea 
                         and you will never escape me. Fog 
                         and Mist...!?

               And he laughs at her, suffocating her. Morgana begins chanting 
               the charm of Making, desperate--

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

               --and she finishes uttering it in her sleep. Her eyes spring 
               open, and vapors issue from her gaping mouth. She screams 
               and the fog gushes out filling the tent.

               EXT. MORGANA'S TENT, MORDRED'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               Fog billows out of the tent, spreading through the camp.

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         A fog is rising, sir.

                                     MORDRED
                         That cannot be.

               He rises and goes out with the lieutenant.

               EXT. MORDRED'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT

               It is fogbound, the campfires yellow smudges within it.

                                     MORDRED
                              (to the lieutenant)
                         My mother has a sense for such things. 
                         She said there would be no fog.

               Mordred enters his mother's tent.

               INT. MORGANA'S TENT - NIGHT

               Mordred enters.

                                     MORDRED
                         ...Mother?

               Morgana, withered, old, lies dead in the bed, wisps of smoke 
               rising from within her ruptured body.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - FOG - DAWN

               Arthur, with Kay and Perceval, canters through the white 
               fog. They are flanked by a phalanx of knights in silver armor.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Kay, you will lead the attack. 
                         Perceval, you will stay with me.

               Kay draws his sword in salute, elated.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Be cautious, my brother.

               He spurs forward, while Arthur reins to a halt, watching him 
               disappear. Perceval and a few knights stay behind and surround 
               the King.

                                     ARTHUR
                         In this battle there is one thing I 
                         must do, that no one else can. Find 
                         Mordred and kill him.

               Ahead, the horrible din of joined battle.

               In the swirling fog, clash of arms follows clash of arms. 
               There is confusion, for each knight is unable to see if he 
               is fighting friend or foe until they are upon each other.

               The battle becomes a series of vicious duels, a knight in 
               silver armor against a knight in black-burnished armor, just 
               glimpsed in the fog that is alive with the clang of sword on 
               shield, the pounding of hooves, the cries of the dying.

               Squires drag away their wounded knights, their young faces 
               pale at the sight of the carnage.

               Kay is unhorsed but picks himself up and mounts a riderless 
               horse, rejoining the combat although he is bleeding.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - FOG - DAY

               It is full day, and the fog blinds with its painful glare. 
               Arthur with Perceval at his side rides through the fog, 
               searching. Perceval takes up a challenge against the King. 
               He unhorses this opponent, piercing him with his lance. He 
               returns to the King's side.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         There are too many on Mordred's side. 
                         We cannot hold out much longer.

               Kay is glimpsed fighting on foot, hurt, barely holding his 
               own, but then the sight is hidden in the fog.

               Kay overcomes his opponent and stops to catch his breath. He 
               is amazed by what he sees. A knight, in old, battle-scarred 
               armor whose pieces don't match, cuts down the knights in 
               black in foray after foray, wheeling and turning in a 
               brilliant and ruthless spectacle of martial arts. He fights 
               without a shield, a lance in his left hand and sword in his 
               right.

               Kay moves away in search of Arthur.

               Arthur and Perceval watch the lone knight meting out death 
               with such terrible beauty, weaving in and out of the fog.

                                     KAY
                         He can be no other.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!

               He spurs his horse forward to join him, but Perceval is quick 
               to stop him.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         No, my lord. We seek Mordred.

                                     KAY
                         I will join him.

               Kay rises onto a fresh horse and gallops away.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - FOG - LATE DAY

               Arthur and Perceval ride alone, the accompanying knights 
               gone, the dying and the dead and the crazed horses all around 
               them.

               Squires are carrying Kay upon his shield. He is dead. Arthur 
               leaps to the ground and reaches out to touch his face, and 
               closes his eyes. He stifles his tears.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Has anyone seen Lancelot?

                                     SQUIRE
                         He lies over there, sir.

               Arthur rushes off, Perceval following on horseback.

               Lancelot is mortally wounded, blood flowing from his abdomen, 
               his eyes open but his gaze dead. Arthur falls to his side.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Squire! Here!

               But there is no one now except the dead and wounded, and 
               Perceval, who dismounts to watch over the King, sword drawn. 
               Desperate, Arthur stops the wound with his hand. Lancelot's 
               eyes are sightless, but tears spill from them.

                                     LANCELOT
                         Arthur.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lancelot, I will save you... Don't 
                         die.

               He tears off a piece of his tunic and staunches the wound 
               with it.

                                     LANCELOT
                         My salvation is to die a Knight of 
                         the Round Table.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You are that and much more. You are 
                         its greatest knight, you are what is 
                         best in men. Now we will be together--

                                     LANCELOT
                         --It is the old wound, that has been 
                         opened. I have always known it would 
                         be the gateway to my death, for it 
                         has never healed. Let my heart do 
                         its job, my King, and pump me empty...

               Arthur takes Lancelot in his arms and rests his lips against 
               the knight's brow.

                                     LANCELOT
                              (a death whisper)
                         Guenevere, has she come to you, is 
                         she Queen again?

               He lies, closing his eyes, unable to look at Lancelot.

                                     ARTHUR
                         She is, Lancelot.

               A boyish smile settles over the features of Lancelot's face, 
               and he dies. Arthur holds him to his breast, his eyes shut 
               tight.

               A strong wind rises. Perceval kneels beside Arthur.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         The fog is lifting. Only we remain 
                         alive.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - EVENING

               Arthur and Perceval rise, and as far as they can see across 
               the green hills that roll down to the sea lies the aftermath 
               of the massacre. Hacked bodies, abandoned armor, steaming 
               horse carcasses, everything still. The murmur of the dying 
               is carried on the wind to the soft roar of the sea. The 
               squires have fled the scene of horror.

                                     ARTHUR
                         But for Mordred. Where is Mordred?

               Elsewhere on the battlefield, Mordred searches the dead, 
               accompanied only by his lieutenant, who turns over the bodies 
               of Arthur's knights.

                                     MORDRED
                         Where is Arthur?

               One of Arthur's knights reaches out blindly for help. Mordred 
               crushes his skull underfoot. The shaft of his huge lance is 
               caked with blood, as are his hands.

               Arthur and Perceval see Mordred and his lieutenant, and the 
               King restrains Perceval from going forward.

                                     ARTHUR
                         No, Perceval. Now it is time for me 
                         to raise my sword.
                              (he bellows out)
                         Mordred, prepare to meet your death.

               Shield on his left arm, and Excalibur in his right, he starts 
               toward Mordred.

                                     MORDRED
                         I wait for you, Father.

               Mordred advances forward, the huge spear in both hands and 
               parallel to the ground.

               Arthur goes straight for him, shield ready to receive the 
               blow. Mordred keeps walking, his arms now tensed back and 
               ready to strike.

               Once they are within weapon's reach of each other, Mordred 
               dashes forward and thrusts the spear. It glances off Arthur's 
               shield, slides under his hauberk and penetrates the King's 
               body, and so powerful was the blow that the blade pierces 
               him right through.

               Mortally wounded, Arthur's scream of pain becomes a horrible 
               war cry, and he drives himself forward with all the strength 
               he has along the spear shaft almost to Mordred's hands. 
               Mordred is knocked back and to the ground and Arthur presses 
               down on him, the butt of the spear pinning Mordred. Arthur 
               lifts Excalibur. Mordred attempts to free himself, as the 
               blade of Excalibur descends upon him and cuts through metal, 
               flesh and bone.

               Mordred's head falls to the ground, rolling away.

               Mordred's lieutenant flees. Perceval races to Arthur's side, 
               and supports the King who has fallen on his knees. Arthur 
               speaks through the pain:

                                     ARTHUR
                         Draw the spear from me. Do it.

               Perceval holds the King tight to himself with one arm, while 
               with the other he draws the shaft through and out of Arthur's 
               body. Arthur sags but doesn't fall. Perceval begins to remove 
               his armor to get at the gaping wounds. The King speaks slowly, 
               softly, from outside his own pain-wracked body.

                                     ARTHUR
                         There is one thing left to do... 
                         Excalibur... And you must do it, 
                         Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command 
                         you.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         I cannot--

                                     ARTHUR
                         --Take Excalibur. Find a pool of 
                         calm water and throw the sword into 
                         it.

               Perceval, stunned by the command, doesn't move.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Obey me, Perceval. You must act for 
                         me. It is my last order as your King. 
                         Do it, and be back!

               Perceval picks up the sword, mounts his horse and rides 
               inland. Arthur watches him go, struggling with the pain, 
               still kneeling, and then his head falls to his chest.

               EXT. POOL, MOORS - EVENING

               Perceval steps through tall reeds to the edge of a pool. He 
               cannot bring himself to throw Excalibur into the water. He 
               examines the blade, and it is haloed with a faint iridescence.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         It is too precious a thing. I can't...

               He backs away from the water and hides the sword in the reeds, 
               and starts back.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - EVENING

               Perceval dismounts, rushing to kneel at the King's side. 
               Arthur looks up, calm and intense.

                                     ARTHUR
                         When you threw it in, what did you 
                         see?

                                     PERCEVAL
                         ...I saw nothing.

               The King looks at him with piercing power. Perceval blurts 
               it out.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur 
                         cannot be lost. Other men--

                                     ARTHUR
                         --By itself it is only a piece of 
                         steel. Its power comes from he who 
                         wields it. For now there is no one. 
                         Do as I have ordered!

               Perceval leaves once more. The daylight is failing, the sun 
               is near the horizon over the sea, bursting through clouds.

               EXT. POOL - EVENING

               He picks up the sword and looks at it for a long time. 
               Finally, with great misgiving, he hurls it into the middle 
               of the pool. As Excalibur is about to touch the water a 
               woman's hand reaches and grasps it by the hilt. It holds the 
               sword aloft for a moment and then draws it under.

               Perceval backs away from the pool stunned by the marvel.

               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - SUNSET

               Perceval returns to the King, terribly excited, shouting 
               from his horse:

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Arthur!

               But Arthur isn't there. Perceval looks around him, he doesn't 
               understand. He sees a trail of blood. He spurs his horse and 
               follows the trail down to the sea.

               EXT. BEACH - SUNSET THEN NIGHT

               There is a trail of blood and prints upon the sand left by a 
               man crawling.

               Perceval follows them toward the sea. He looks around, 
               searching, terribly distraught.

               Where the blood and prints cease, there are many footprints 
               coming from and returning into the sea. Perceval looks out 
               across the waves.

               He sees a sailing vessel rising on the swell. On its deck he 
               can make out the distant figure of Arthur, lying surrounded 
               by women, their gossamer robes rippling in the wind. The sun 
               hovers on the horizon and the ship is heading for it.

               He gallops into the waves until his horse will go no further, 
               calling out with all his strength, a futile attempt:

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Arthur! Will you return?

               The sun slips below the horizon. Night is falling, and the 
               wind whips the wavecrests. He turns from the sea and wades 
               back.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         All the knights of the Round Table 
                         are dead. Excalibur is returned. 
                         Arthur is gone. Maybe he lives, maybe 
                         he will return...

               He stops at the edge of the water. In the uncertain light 
               sky and sea become one. He draws the chalice out of a pouch 
               on his saddle, and he holds it up before him.

                                     PERCEVAL
                         Only I remain, and this...

               The wind swirls and whistles mysteriously in the hollow of 
               the cup. Music grand and melancholic grows from it. The 
               chalice, etched in starlight, is the last thing that is taken 
               from sight in the enfolding darkness.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

          The man facing us is bearded, sweating, intense,'joyous.
          Jacket and tie, jeans, fortyish. His name is Wittold Levi.
          eXistenZ.
          Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word.

                         LEVI
          Written like this. One word.
          Small e. Capital X, capital Z.
          He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience.

                         LEVI
          eXistenZ. It's new, it's from
          Antenna Research, and it's here,
          right now.
          We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some
          standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are
          of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud
          enthusiastically.
          We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated
          country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted
          plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman
          - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two
          dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski
          boots.

                         LEVI
          My name is Wittold Levi, my
          friends call me Witt - and I'm
          the project manager for eXistenZ.
          I recognize some familiar faces -
          that's all right, that's all
          right. We won't throw you out. We
          encourage consumer loyalty, and
          we want you to help us with our
          product testing. We're a team,
          Antenna and you.
          A delighted stir from the crowd.

                         LEVI
          Those of you who have come to our
          invited seminars before will know
          that I normally lead the group
          through our new games, but

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LEVI (CONT'D)
          tonight, it won't be me. No, for
          the test launch of eXistenZ by
          Antenna, we have brought you a
          seminar leader who is rather
          special.
          An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be?

                         LEVI
          Yes, it is. The world's greatest
          game designer is here, in person,
          to lead you, the first test
          enclave, through her newest
          creation, eXistenZ by Antenna...
          The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed,
          murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees.

                         LEVI
          I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess
          herself - Allegra Geller!
          Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it
          until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to
          now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security
          guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an
          electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as
          Ted Pikul (rhymes with "Michael", not with "pickle"), and we
          will see more of him later.
          As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the
          crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part
          like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own
          personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais
          like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog.
          Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is
          bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she
          speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic.

                         GELLER
          The world of games is in a kind
          of a trance. People are
          programmed to accept so little,
          but the possibilities are so
          great.

                         (PAUSE)
          You probably thought that
          tonight, we were going to test a
          new game that I designed.
          Excited murmurings from the crowd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          But there is no new game to test,
          at least, not in the usual sense.
          Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings.

                         GELLER
          No, no, it's going to be much
          better than you expected, because
          eXistenZ is not just a game. It's
          an entirely new game system.
          Antenna Research and I developed
          it together - the eXistenZ System
          by Antenna - and it involves a
          whole lot of new toys, which you
          are going to be the first to try
          out.
          The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling,
          playing off the renewed energy.

                         LEVI
          MetaFlesh.
          Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word.

                         LEVI
          Written like this. One word.
          Capital M, capital F. MetaFlesh
          is what our new toys are made of
          - the MetaFlesh Game-Pod, only
          from Antenna Research. It
          connects with any industry
          standard bioport, which I know
          you all have or you wouldn't be
          here...
          (chuckles from the crowd)
          .using, however, a very non-
          standard connecting device which
          we call...
          Levi turns again to the chalkboard.

                         LEVI
          .we call an UmbyCord. Spelled
          like this.
          Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now-
          salivating audience.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LEVI
          I guess you can tell I started
          off as a schoolteacher.

                         4 (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES)
          But I never had anything quite so
          fun or so revolutionary to teach
          as what Allegra and I are going
          to teach you all tonight.
          With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his
          two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices
          on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention
          at either end of it.

                         LEVI
          Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by
          Antenna Research ready?

                         ASSISTANTS

                         (TOGETHER)
          Yes, Mr; Levi.

                         LEVI
          And how many of these precious
          prototypes did we manage to bring
          with us?

                         FEMALE ASSISTANT
          Twenty-one, Mr. Levi.
          Levi's face clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the
          following exchange.

                         LEVI

                         (SOTTO VOCE)
          Twenty-one? I thought we had an
          even two dozen.

                         MALE ASSISTANT
          The first three we opened were...
          unhealthy.

                         LEVI
          Really? Any chance that some of
          the others...?

                         FEMALE ASSISTANT
          We think we're clean.

                         LEVI

                         J

                         (RESTRAINED FURY)
          God-damn better be.
          Levi turns back to his audience, radiant once more.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LEVI
          We have twenty-one prototype
          MetaFlesh Game-Pods, and that
          means that for our first wave
          test enclave we need twenty-one
          volunteers who will port in these
          slave units with the Game-Pod
          Goddess herself...
          Levi doesn't need to finish his pitch. Every hand is waving
          in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, "Me, me, oh
          God, please, let it be me!"
          Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity
          of the small crowd's enthusiasm.

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

          A SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais
          and are fitted with their game gear:
          The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open
          the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside,
          resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like
          living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods.
          Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player
          UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot
          connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted,
          translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below
          the surface.
          The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to
          receive communion.
          The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases.
          The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the
          back of the game-pods.
          The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are
          lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which
          are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal
          jacks positioned just above the belt line.
          Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the
          dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his
          bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering,
          rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous
          system, on his lap.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed
          i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game-
          pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the
          players on either side of her.
          We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul,
          standing with arms folded near the church's side door,
          watching the proceedings with fascination.
          A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from
          the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens
          it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church.
          Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his
          way.

                         PIKUL
          Hold it. Not so fast.
          In response, the fan thrusts a card at him.
          Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which
          includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats
          his name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul
          into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl
          case slung over his shoulder.

                         DICHTER
          Oh, god. I hope I'm not too late.
          Did I miss the port-in?

                         PIKUL
          It's just the first wave. You can
          be part of the second wave.
          (rereads the invitation)
          OK, Joel Dichter. Put your arms
          up. I have to scan you. Metal and
          heavy synthetics can't come in.

                         DICHTER

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          A weapons check?

                         PIKUL
          More for recording devices. Lotta
          money invested in these games.
          Industrial espionage happens.
          What's in this case?

                         DICHTER
          I brought my game-pod. It's got
          original Marway tissue
          architecture. It's kind of
          obsolete but I was hoping,...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DICHTER (CONT'D)
          even though I couldn't afford the
          Antenna Fifteen upgrade, I
          figured out a method of virtual
          porting that I thought might...
          Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens the
          zipper and feels around. In the case is a more solid,
          rubbery version of the new MetaFlesh pods.

                         PIKUL
          You won't need it tonight.
          Everything's provided for.
          Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais. He almost faints.

                         DICHTER
          Migod! Is that who I think it is?

          .PIKUL
          (with paternal pride)
          Yeah, that's her. She's
          something, isn't she?

                         DICHTER
          But why would a star like her
          come to a product seminar in a
          little one-horse town like this?

                         PIKUL
          This is where the real people
          live, Joel. Her real fans, like
          you.

                         DICHTER
          Yeah, well, you said it. Just
          like me.
          Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to
          join the spectators who will form the second wave and re-
          locks the door.
          On the dais, in the center of the circle of linked game
          players, Levi nods at Geller.

                         LEVI
          Everything's in order. Are you
          ready, Allegra?

                         T

                         GELLER

                         (PUMPED)
          Sure. This is my favourite part.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          There is giddy laughter in the room. Geller looks at every
          player-in the circle as Levi steps down off the platform and
          retires to the far edge of the small, watching throng.

                         GELLER
          I'm ready to download eXistenZ by
          Antenna Research into you all
          now. I'm warning you, it's going
          to be a wild ride, but don't
          panic no matter what happens.
          I'll see you all back here in no
          time at all.
          Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous, uncertain, but
          it's too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance
          on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their
          eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have
          suddenly been contacted by the spirit world. The pods in
          their laps begin a rhythmic, peristaltic rippling.
          At the edge of the crowd, Pikul sidles up to Levi.

                         PIKUL

                         (TO LEVI)
          She seems to be very shy. It
          never occurred to me that a big
          star would be shy.

                         LEVI
          She spends most of her time alone
          in a room designing her games. I
          think she'd like it best if she
          never had to show them to
          anybody.

                         PIKUL
          Really? She doesn't enjoy all the
          adulation?

                         LEVI
          She hates having to port in with
          her fans. It's too intimate.

                         PIKUL
          Then why does she do it?

                         LEVI

                         (LAUGHS)
          We make her do it.

                         I D

                         PIKUL
          By "we" you mean, the game
          company, Antenna Research?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         A

                         LEVI '
          That's what I mean.

                         PIKUL
          Why?

                         I

                         LEVI

                         (SUDDENLY SUSPICIOUS)
          Are you with us or did an
          independent security company send
          you?

                         PIKUL
          Me? Oh, I'm with your own
          management training program.
          (shows him a card)
          I want to end up in marketing and
          public relations.
          (holds up security wand)
          The only thing I know about
          security is how to switch this
          thing on.

                         LEVI

                         (SATISFIED)
          Well, for example, we've spent a
          fortune developing eXistenZ, but
          we all know it's a risky project.
          She might have to make changes.
          It's the only way we can convince
          her that there might be a
          problem.

                         PIKUL

                         (PUZZLED)
          A problem with her new game?

                         LEVI
          eXistenZ is a lot more than a
          game.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, right, it's a game system.
          I heard that.

                         LEVI
          And we're worried that it's too
          intellectual, too complex, too
          weird, too artsy. That argument ;
          never bothers her until she faces
          her fans. She hates to be
          rejected in the flesh, so we make
          her come out sometimes to take
          the heat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL

                         (ADMIRINGLY)
          4 I've heard that she's very
          sensitive.
          A strange, choral humming begins to fill the church. Pikul
          and Levi turn their attention to the dais, where the fans
          rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods in their laps.

                         PIKUL
          What are they doing?

                         LEVI

                         (LAUGHS)
          It's the new Antenna Research
          theme song. We thought this would
          be a good way to launch it.
          Everybody who plays eXistenZ is
          going to be very familiar with
          that tune.
          Haltingly, but gamely, Pikul tries to hum along.

                         PIKUL
          Catchy.
          Levi helps him out, and soon the whole room is humming along
          happily, warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme
          song.
          The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter, who, at
          the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around
          in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder.
          In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete
          game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone
          and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small
          mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is
          the trigger.
          Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few
          gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the
          dais.
          Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's
          still blissed out and humming, then launches himself
          awkwardly through the crowd.
          Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way
          towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his
          weapon as he goes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DICHTER
          Death to eXistenZ! Death to
          Antenna Research! Death to the
          demoness Allegra Geller!

                         P

                         PIKUL

                         (TO DICHTER)
          No! Don't do it!
          Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small
          crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter
          hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller.
          The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off
          her chair, which collapses over her and takes the second
          bullet on its seat rim.
          The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and
          jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's
          traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her
          folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and
          confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of
          it. Blood seeps in between her fingers
          Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform
          to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the
          players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately
          goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the
          ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their
          shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain
          transmitting through their UmbyCords.
          Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him
          with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his
          weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But
          before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants
          produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty
          their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to
          squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting
          him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost
          amongst the jostling feet.
          The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the
          players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously
          causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying
          Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at
          whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of
          bodies.
          in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the
          stamping, sliding feet, he finds himself lying across the
          stricken-Levi. Levi clutches Pikul desperately.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LEVI
          Get her out of here! Save her!
          There might be more of them! Go
          on!

                         PIKUL
          Me? Me take her?

                         LEVI
          (urgent, pleading)
          We have enemies in our own house.
          Trust no one. Trust no one...
          The wide-eyed Pikul scrambles to his feet and promptly trips
          over the all-but-dead Dichter. He falls painfully to his
          knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in
          his hand. Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified.
          He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as
          he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their
          way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns
          cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun
          into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly
          looking around for Geller.
          She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a
          few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul
          unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a
          lot of clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one
          arm, screams at them.

                         PIKUL

                         (SCREAMS)
          She's coming with me! I'm
          responsible for her! She's
          supposed to come with me!
          To his surprise, Geller laughs a dazed, hearty laugh.

                         GELLER

                         (LAUGHS)
          Am I? With you?

                         PIKUL
          (quietly, firmly)
          Yeah, you're coming with me.
          Pikul pulls her to her feet, but she immediately dives back
          to the floor to find her game-pod and UmbyCord.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          (suddenly near hysteria)
          I can't lose this! I can't lose
          this!
          She finds the game-pod still under the folding chair, a bit
          flattened on one side but in one piece. She grabs the game-
          pod and its UmbyCord and stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod
          case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais. As she
          clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and hauls her
          through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded
          dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They
          head for the door, fighting everybody off as though they
          might be lethal.
          As they leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six
          fans, shrieking like monkeys, still stomping and kicking the
          body of Dichter viciously, hysterically, while Levi's two
          assistants carry him to the safety of the church's apse.

          EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

          Pikul and Geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves
          standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church. The
          church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside
          a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a
          crossroad.
          Pikul and Geller look around wildly. The vehicles in the
          parking lot are country, pickup trucks, rusted vans, 4x4s.
          Across the road, aloof, maybe too high-class for the parking
          lot, sits a Land Rover Defender 110, the one with the roof
          cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the
          front. Geller gestures towards the Defender.

                         GELLER
          Let's take my limo.

                         PIKUL

                         (WILD)
          No, no!

                         GELLER
          Why no?

                         PIKUL
          I don't trust the driver!

                         GELLER
          You drive, idiot!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          They cross the road and jump in the Defender. Frances, the
          driver, sixtyish, a retired lady farmer who moonlights, is
          apprehensive.

                         FRANCES
          What's the commotion, Miss
          Geller? Say, are you all right?
          What's goin' on in there?

                         GELLER
          We need this vehicle, and we need
          it without you. But with the
          keys.

                         FRANCES
          I can't do that. I can't abandon
          my vehicle.
          Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikul's
          pocket. She points it at Frances.

                         GELLER
          Get out, Frances. You can say you
          were hijacked.

                         FRANCES

                         (CHUCKLES)
          It'll take more than a dead
          squirrel to get me out of this
          seat.
          Geller fires two shots. One rips a hole in Frances's
          headrest.

                         FRANCES
          (getting out of her seat)
          You have to push the shift lever
          down to get it into reverse.

                         GELLER
          Thanks, Frances.
          They drive off down the country road, leaving Frances in the
          dust.

          INT. DEFENDER LIMO - NIGHT

          Pikul drives. He can see why the limo is an off-road
          vehicle: the road is terrible, dirt and gravel, stutter
          potholes and sharp ridges, the occasional fallen tree.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          (manic, scared)
          I normally like the countryside,
          don't you? Normally, the country
          is relaxing and calm.

                         GELLER
          Only if you don't really know
          what's going on.

                         PIKUL
          What do you mean?

                         GELLER
          There is great stress and anger
          and violence in the countryside.
          Thousands of life forms all
          screaming ME ME ME and trying to
          kill and dominate and devour the
          other life forms. It's terrifying
          and exhausting.

                         PIKUL

                         (LAMELY)
          Well, I like the countryside.

                         GELLER
          That's good, `cause you might end
          up spending a lot of time here.

                         PIKUL
          I might?

                         GELLER
          Sure. If you go back home to the
          city, they'll probably be waiting
          for you.

                         PIKUL
          They?

                         GELLER
          Yeah. My assassins. They'd want
          to have a little talk with you
          about where I am.

                         PIKUL
          I was hoping that was just one
          crazy guy.

                         GELLER
          Did you hear the way he screamed
          at me? He wasn't alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Everybody likes a conspiracy.
          It's more satisfying than just
          one crazy guy doing one crazy
          thing.
          Geller goes silent.

                         PIKUL
          Well, what are we going to do out
          here? Do you know your way
          around? You know any country
          people?

                         GELLER
          Not country people. Games people.
          The countryside's full of games
          development people, project co-
          ordinators, little factories -
          you name it.

                         PIKUL
          That's weird. I never knew that.

                         GELLER
          The city's full of bad
          microwaves, bad thermals, bad
          electro-optics. You can't shield
          from it anymore. You can't get
          true readings. The whole industry
          moved out of the city years ago.

                         PIKUL
          So you know your way around. We
          can hide out.

                         GELLER
          Maybe. But it seems I have some
          enemies I didn't know I had.
          "Death to Allegra Geller." How'd
          you like to hear somebody with a
          gun screaming, "Death to Ted
          Pikul"?

                         PIKUL
          Wow.
          (reflective pause; then)
          Hey, how'd you know my name?

                         GELLER
          (indicating his name tag)
          You're labelled.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Oh. Yeah.

                         (PAUSE)
          How did you know how to fire that,
          gun? I've never seen anything
          like it.

                         GELLER
          It has a trigger. I pulled it.

                         PIKUL
          Can I see it?

                         GELLER
          Later. I think I'm gonna use it
          in my next game. If there ever is
          a next game.
          Pikul glances at her. He hits a pothole and she bounces
          around in her seat, exposing her far shoulder to him. Her
          shirt is soaked with blood.

                         PIKUL
          Migod, you're bleeding. I forgot
          you got hit.
          There is an urgent buzzing from somewhere in Pikul's breast
          pocket.

                         GELLER
          What's that?

                         PIKUL
          It's my pink-fone. I'm not sure I
          should answer it.

                         GELLER
          Answer it.
          Pikul pulls the pink-fone - it's soft surgical plastic,
          palm-sized - out of his pocket. When he squeezes it open, a
          diffuse pink light swells up from deep inside it.

                         PIKUL

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Ted Pikul.

                         (PAUSE)
          What happened? Some fan went
          crazy and started shooting up the
          place. I don't know why. He was
          just nuts. Allegra Geller? She's
          with me. We're OK. Yeah. Yeah.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL (CONT'D)

                         (PAUSE)
          You're kidding me. You're kidding
          me! God. 1 can't believe it. I
          can't do that. No, how can I do
          that? Well, I'm not really sure
          where we are because...
          Geller grabs the pink-tone from him. She fumbles around with
          it, trying to find the power button. She accidentally
          summons up a read-out, which she pauses to look at. What she
          sees makes her glance up at Pikul.

                         PIKUL
          What? Can I have my pink-tone
          back?
          Geller finds the power button and pushes it. The pink inner
          light flutters out. She unceremoniously throws the pink-tone
          out the window. It lands in a rain ditch full of frogs.

                         PIKUL

                         (IN SHOCK)
          What did you do that for? That
          was our lifeline to civilization.

                         GELLER
          That was a rangefinder. As long
          as you have that, they know where
          you are.

                         PIKUL
          They? You mean head office?

                         GELLER
          I mean anybody.

                         (PAUSE)
          I heard what Levi said to you. He
          said, "We have enemies in our own
          house." He said it as he was
          dying.

                         PIKUL

                         (FLUSTERED)
          I don't think he died. I mean, do
          you? I think he maybe fainted...
          Maybe he went unconscious...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          That was Alex Kindred, head of
          publicity and marketing, at
          Antenna HQ...

                         (WISTFUL)
          .on that very expensive pink-
          fone you threw away.

                         (DEEP SIGH)
          He said that some bizarre
          fanatical group called the Anti-
          eXistenZialists has put a price
          of 5 million dollars on your
          head, payable to anybody who
          kills you. It's been released to
          all the media now. Everybody
          knows about it.

                         GELLER

                         (IN DISBELIEF)
          Anti-existentialists?

                         PIKUL
          No. Anti-eXistenZialists. Capital
          X, capital Z. They somehow found
          out about eXistenZ and they want
          to kill you for creating it. They
          say that the eXistenZ game system
          will "finally destroy reality",
          or something totally nuts like
          that.

                         GELLER

                         (STRANGELY SATISFIED)
          Yeah.

                         PIKUL
          It makes sense to you? You're not
          suprised?

                         GELLER
          I hear things. It's hard to
          surprise me.

                         (PAUSE)
          And what else?

                         PIKUL
          Kindred said that I'm your
          bodyguard and the company is
          holding me totally responsible
          for your safety.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER

                         (PAUSE)
          Pikul, why don't you have a gun
          with you?

                         PIKUL
          What?

                         GELLER
          You're not armed. They told me
          you were my security but you have
          no weaponry.

                         PIKUL
          Who told you that? I'm just a
          marketing trainee. My clinic
          master thought I'd learn
          something about marketing if I
          moonlighted as a security guard
          on one of your test previews.

                         GELLER
          Fuck. I'm marked for death and
          they send me on the road with a
          PR nerd.

                         PIKUL
          (realization setting in)
          Jesus! Marked for death!

                         GELLER
          Don't sweat it, Pikul. I'll
          handle it. We just have to
          disappear for a while. And right
          now, we have to stop.

                         PIKUL
          We do? Why?

                         GELLER

                         (DEADPAN)
          So we can have an intimate moment
          together.

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

          The intimate moment involves Pikul digging the bullet out of
          I Geller's shoulder with a Swiss Army knife while kneeling in
          front of the idling Defender's headlights. Pikul'is being
          squeamish and not getting the job done.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER

                         (IRRITATED)
          C'mon. If you're gonna do it, do
          it.

                         PIKUL

          OK, OK.
          He grits his teeth and digs in with a bit more gusto.
          Something yellow and white, like a kernel of corn, flips out
          of her wound and onto the road's shredding asphalt. Pikul
          feels around for it, finds it, holds it up to the light.

                         PIKUL
          I got it. Wow. Did somebody bite
          you?

                         GELLER
          What do you mean?

                         PIKUL
          What I just dug out of you. It's
          a tooth. A human tooth.
          Pikul holds the tooth out to her, but she just glances at
          it, then rummages around in her MetaFlesh game-pod bag.

                         GELLER
          Lemme see that weirdo pistol.
          Geller pulls the strange weapon out of the bag. After a
          moment of study, she expertly pops the magazine out of the
          grip. The gristly magazine is packed with teeth.

                         GELLER
          Yep. The bullets are human teeth.
          Look - this one's got a cavity.

                         PIKUL
          That thing was designed to get
          past any kind of metal or
          synthetics detector. It's all
          flesh and bone.

                         GELLER
          I suppose the smaller caliber
          pistols would have to fire baby
          teeth. The tooth fairy could go
          I into the arms business.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          That guy really came there
          tonight just to kill you.

                         GELLER 4

                         (WITH IRONY)
          Amazing, isn't it?

          EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

          We follow the Defender as it parks outside the Salmon Falls
          Motel. Pikul jumps out carrying two paper bags of Perky
           Pat's takeout. He knees the truck door shut and walks over
          to motel door 5.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Inside the very basic motel room, Pikul sits hypnotized,
          reverentially watching Geller as he obsessively packs the
          greasy remains of their Perky Pat burgers into the smallest
          possible paper bundle.
          Geller is sitting in the middle of her twin bed, her pod
          before her on a hotel towel which is draped over her lap,
          UmbyCord jacked into her bioport, a second towel slipping
          off her shoulders leaving her almost naked, her shoulder
          wound livid in the 25-watt light of the night table lamp.
          Her hands twitch delicately over the surface of the pod like
          insect antennae, so delicately that we are not sure that she
          is actually touching the pod. Her eyes are half-closed, and
          she is obviously in some kind of trance-like, ecstatic
          state.
          Finally, she comes out of it and unplugs her UmbyCord,
          discretely rearranging her towels in the process. She sighs
          and speaks, not exactly to Pikul.

                         GELLER
          The whole gamesworld is in a kind
          of trance.

                         PIKUL
          Yes. I remember you said that at
          the church.

                         J

                         GELLER
          People are prepared to accept so
          little. They're in a'cage formed
          out of their own limited

                         GELLER (CONT'D)
          expectations. They have no idea
          what amazing things could be
          theirs.

                         PIKUL
          Where were you just now? What
          were you doing?

                         GELLER
          (a worried frown)
          I was wandering through eXistenZ
          - the new system, I mean.
          (a shy, sexy smile)
          I like it in there. Of course,
          without another player you're
          only a tourist. It's frustrating.

                         PIKUL
          Why won't you let me contact
          Antenna? They've got to be going
          crazy, wondering what's happened
          to you. I mean, it's not like
          we've done something wrong. We
          just ran because we didn't know
          how many of them there were,
          right? I think we owe it to
          Antenna to let them know you're
          all right, to get them to send
          somebody to help you who knows
          what he's doing... And besides, I
          can't... I can't just keep doing
          this, whatever it is, you know,
          forever, not having any idea when
          it's going to be...
          Geller gets up and goes over to Pikul. She pulls up his
          shirt.

                         PIKUL
          Hey, what are you doing?

                         GELLER
          Where's your bioport? Don't tell
          me you were never fitted. I can't
          believe it.
          Pikul shrugs his shirt back down, starts tucking it in.

                         PIKUL
          No, I was never fitted with a
          bioport. What do you care?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          You're hoping to get into the biz
          and you've never played one of my
          games. You've never played any
          game. That means you have no idea

                         %
          what a genius I am.

                         PIKUL

                         (LAMELY)
          My clinic master told me I don't
          need to play a game to know how
          to sell it.

                         GELLER
          Bullshit. Posturing. You don't
          play my games, you don't work for
          Antenna Research, I'll make sure
          of that.

                         PIKUL
          Look, I've been dying to play
          your games. But I have this -
          phobia about having my body
          penetrated - surgically. You know
          what I mean.

                         GELLER
          I'm not so sure I do.

                         PIKUL
          Getting a bioport fitted... I
          dunno. I can't do it. It's too
          freaky. Makes my skin crawl.

                         GELLER
          God, c'mon. They just pop your
          spine with a little hydro-gun.
          Shoot the port-plug into it. They
          do it at malls, like getting your
          ears pierced.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, sure. With only an
          infinitesimal chance of permanent
          spinal paralysis. I've read all
          about it.

                         GELLER
          It's your chosen profession,
          geek.
          She pauses, then moves very close to him. She breathes her
          words slowly, intimately, into his ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER

                         (HOTLY)
          There's an intimacy involved in
          playing eXistenZ that is beyond
          description. It has to be
          experienced. And frankly, the
          two-player version is the most
          exquisitely intense. Wouldn't you
          like to play with me?

                         PIKUL
          (his resolve is crumbling)
          Well, yeah, of course, but... Let
          me, uh, let me call Antenna...

                         GELLER
          (a gentle threat)
          They wouldn't want to talk to you
          if they knew you had never had a
          bioport installed. It's company
          policy, you know. They want you
          to be passionate about your work.

                         (VERY SEDUCTIVE)
          Besides, once you're ported,
          there's no end to the games you
          can play.

                         PIKUL

                         (HE'S SWEATING)
          You can't seriously want to play
          games now. Not here. Not while
          we're being hunted down by crazy
          people. _
          Geller sighs, then switches into her explaining-the-facts-
          of-life-to-a-child mode.

                         GELLER
          (cradling her pod)
          My baby here took a huge hit in
          the church, Pikul. You see how
          she's quivering?
          Pikul takes a look. The pod is, in fact, quivering like a
          terrified hamster.

                         PIKUL
          It... she, yes, she's quivering.

          GELLER (CONT' D)
          out just as the game architecture
          was being downloaded from her to
          all those slave pods... that's a
          very vulnerable time for her. She
          could be crying out for help
          right here, right now.

                         (CHOKING UP)
          The only way I can tell if
          everything's OK - the game's not
          been contaminated, the pod, my
          baby, is not about to be crippled
          for life because of my negligence
          - the only way is to play
          eXistenZ with somebody friendly.
          Are you friendly, or are you not?

                         PIKUL

                         (PAUSE)
          Sure, all right.
          (he might have found a way

                         OUT)
          Let's do it... let's do it now.
          Let me see.
          (checks his watch)
          To get an illegal, unregistered
          bioport installed at about
          midnight - we just drive up to
          your local country gas station,
          right?

          EXT. COUNTRY GAS STATION - NIGHT

          The Defender is parked by the pumps. A gangly pump attendant
          - his name, embroidered on his overalls, seems to be Gas -
          fills the truck as Pikul and Geller hover nervously.

                         GAS
          Anything else I can do for you?

                         GELLER
          Well, Gas, you could check your
          bioport-plugs.

                         GAS
          The what? The sparkplugs?

                         GELLER
          You heard me. My friend here has
          a bioport problem.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GAS

                         (COOL)
          A bioport, now, that's a sort of
          a hole in your spine, isn't it?
          Lotta assholes `round here, but
          that's generally it. I don't know
          why you'd be talking to me about
          that, lady.
          Geller smiles a knowing smile.

                         GELLER
          Sure you do.
          Gas looks at her closely for the first time. His eyes widen
          in disbelief. He pulls a greasy wallet out of his overalls
          and flips out the card holders. Amongst various family
          photos, hot rod photos, fishing photos, is a photo of
          Allegra Geller clipped from a glossy magazine. Under the
          photo is the legend "Genius In A Game-Pod".
          Gas takes her hand in his and kisses it.

                         GAS
          Allegra Geller. You changed my
          life.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

          Pikul sits on a mouldy, greasy, plump, wingback chair in the
          corner of the gas-station garage, watching Gas balance
          shakily on one leg as he puts on a fresh set of overalls.

                         PIKUL
          What was your life like before?

                         GAS
          Before?

                         PIKUL
          Before it was changed by Allegra
          Geller.

                         GAS
          I operated a gas station.

                         PIKUL
          But you still operate a gas
          station, don't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GAS
          Only on the most pathetic level
          of reality. Geller's work
          liberated me.

                         PIKUL
          Liberated?

                         GAS
          Did you ever play her game
          ArtGod? One word, capital A,
          capital G?

                         PIKUL
          I don't have a bioport, remember?

                         GAS
          "Thou, the player of the game,
          art God." Very spiritual. Funny,
          too. God, the artist. The
          mechanic.
          (chuckles to himself)
          Funny.
          Gas zips up his fresh overalls.

                         PIKUL

                         (UNEASY)
          Those are sterile, are they?

                         GAS
          Not to worry. They way they set
          things up, you could fire in a
          bioport in a slaughterhouse and
          not generate an infection.

                         PIKUL
          Then why the clean overalls?

                         GAS
          It's a mental thing. Helps me
          focus. The one thing you don't
          want to do is miss with the stud-
          finder.

                         PIKUL
          Oh, God.

                         GAS

                         (BIG SMILE)
          God, the mechanic.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Z'R
          Gas slides open a drawer of his red metal mechanic's rolling
          toolbox and pulls out a greasy device that looks like a
          carbon-fibre voltage meter.

                         GAS
          We call this thing a stud-finder.'
          It locates the spot on your spine
          where the x intersects with the
          y. We don't want to be even a
          micron out of whack. That's when
          you get troubles. It's a little
          radar/sonar/laser thingee. Marks
          you with a special range-finding
          dye.

                         PIKUL
          Never say dye.

                         GAS
          Lift up your shirt and turn
          around.

          EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

          In the heat of the summer night, game-pod case still slung
          over her shoulder, Geller wanders around the periphery of
          the gas station, touching things - trees, the ground, grass
          - at random, her expression suggesting that everything she
          sees is amazing and delightful and slightly disturbing, like
          someone who has wandered into a sculpture garden where
          everything is perfect in every detail except that everything
          is made out of bronze.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

          Gas pulls the trigger on the stud-finder, then removes it
          from Pikul's back. We see a small purple flower-mark, like
          the kind that marks sides of beef, on the skin over Pikul's
          spine just above the belt line. Pikul stands up from his
          kneeling position on the wingback chair. He stretches,
          twists. Everything seems to be all right.

                         GAS
          See, that didn't hurt, did it?

                         PIKUL
          I didn't expect that to hurt. I
          expect the next part to hurt.
          Gas pulls the bioport insertion gun out of another drawer,
          this time a locked wooden one bolted under his metal-topped
          work bench. It is a scary thing, like a hydraulic jack
          designed by Giger, only smaller.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, that's what I expect will
          hurt.

                         GAS
          I've never crippled anyone yet.

                         PIKUL
          How many have you done?

                         GAS
          Three. Well, you'll be the third.

          EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

          We are close on a bizarre insect which sits unsteadily on
          the chrome of a gas pump handle. Geller's hand comes into
          frame and gently eases the creature into its palm. Geller
          floats her hand closer to her face and studies the creature
          with an expression of rapture on her face.
          The insect is large, praying mantis-sized, and it has two
          heads, neither of which seems to know how to deal with the
          other one. Each time it attempts to move, it falls over in
          an awkward heap because its legs are all different sizes and
          shapes. It beats its large, papery wings wildly in order to
          pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process
          all over again. Eventually, its wing action lifts it off
          Geller's hand - more by accident than will, it seems - and
          the creature disappears in the darkness surrounding the gas
          pumps.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

          Geller enters the garage and sees Pikul with his back to the
          wall of the service bay and a large wrench in his hand,
          poised and threatening. Gas stands twenty feet away, his
          insertion gun at the ready. A Mexican standoff.

                         GELLER
          What's going on, Gas?

                         GAS
          Hell, he's acting like I'm
          attackin' him. People usually pay
          me.to do this, you know.

                         11

                         PIKUL
          Yeah. All two of them.
          As you can see, I've decided not
          to have a bioport installed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         31
          Geller walks over to Pikul and puts her face quite close to
          his. He watches her lips move from the corner of his eye.
          They. are full and moist and convincing.

                         GELLER
          This is it, you see. This is the
          cage I was talking about, the
          cage of your own making which
          keeps you trapped and pacing
          about in the smallest possible
          space forever. Break out of your
          cage, Pikul. Break out now.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          Wearing mechanic's work gloves, Gas fires in the bioport
          plug. Its impact knocks the breath out of Pikul, like being
          kicked in the spine; he can't even scream. When Gas pulls
          the insertion device away from Pikul's back, we see the
          glossy plastic head of the bioport plug. It's surrounded by
          a small, angry-looking volcano of rashy, irritated flesh.

                         GELLER
          That swelling doesn't last for
          long. Tomorrow, you won't even
          notice it.

                         PIKUL
          I love it. Great.
          Pikul tries to get up from the wingback chair and promptly
          collapses into the arms of Geller and Gas.

                         PIKUL

                         (PANIC-STRICKEN)
          What's going on? I can't walk!

                         GAS
          The procedure comes with its own
          epidural, just like when you have
          a baby. Kinda like instant
          paralysis from the waist down?
          That's why it didn't hurt you.
          It'll wear off in about twenty
          minutes.
          As they ease Pikul into a sitting position in the chair, Gas
          almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in
          one hand. He leans it against the wingback chair, and Pikul
          notices blood and flecks of skin on Gas's work gloves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          You're looking more like a
          butcher than a mechanic.

                         GAS
          Things do get kinda confused
          these days, don't they? I'm gonna
          go wash up. You two make
          yourselves at home.
          Gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great
          satisfaction. Geller eases her game-pod out of its case and
          starts to attach its two-player, Y-shaped UmbyCord to it.

                         PIKUL
          What are you doing?

                         GELLER
          We don't have to wait for the
          swelling to go down.

                         PIKUL
          You're going to port into me?
          While I'm paralysed?

                         GELLER
          You wanted to play my game,
          didn't you?

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, I did, and I do, but...
          Here? Now?

                         GELLER
          It's an instant-on world, isn't
          it?
          She lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport. It already
          looks a bit less angry than it did before. Geller caresses
          it, prods it, plays with it. Then she takes out a little
          bottle of WD-40 and sprays it around and into the port.

                         PIKUL
          What's that for? It feels cold.

                         GELLER
          New ports are sometimes a bit
          tight. Wouldn't want to hurt you.

                         PIKUL
          How come bioports don't get
          infected? I mean, they open right
          into your body...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          Listen to what you're saying,
          Pikul. Don't be ludicrous.

                         PIKUL

                         (VERY NERVOUS)
          Don't you think you could call me
          Ted?

                         GELLER
          Maybe afterwards.
          Geller gently works her UmbyJack into Pikul's bioport. She
          locks her eyes onto his, then squeezes her game-pod's ON
          teat. Instantly, her pod convulses and begins to flash and
          spark and crackle. White electronic smoke seeps from its
          crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its
          pores.
          Geller leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her
          UmbyJack out of Pikul's spine. He can't feel it, but the
          furious force of her move twists him in his chair.

                         GELLER

                         (FURIOUS)
          Shit, Pikul! I can't believe
          this! I trusted you and you blew
          my pod! You must have neural-
          surged!

                         PIKUL
          What do you mean?

                         GELLER

                         (IN DESPAIR)
          I jacked you into my pod and you
          obviously panicked. Now it's
          totally fucked! This is a
          disaster!

                         PIKUL
          I.. I was nervous, but I didn't
          panic.

                         GELLER

                         (FIGHTING HYSTERIA)
          I was forced to trust you and you
          panicked and you neural-surged,
          and you blew my pod.

                         PIKUL
          You can get a new pod...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          (her heart is breaking)
          Pikul, in this pod is the only,
          the original version of eXistenZ,
          an entire game system that cost
          thirty-eight million to develop,
          not including pre-release
          marketing costs. And I'm locked
          outside of my own game! I can't
          get it out, or me in!

                         PIKUL
          Are you serious? This is the only
          version that exists?

                         GELLER
          Security is everything these
          days. It's the only one and its
          stuck inside and it's your fault.
          Geller uses her sleeve to clean the drool off the pod with
          tragic gentleness, as though it were an injured child.

                         GELLER
          (fighting back tears)
          I've devoted my five most
          passionate years to this strange
          little creature. And I've never
          regretted it, Pikul, because I
          knew that it was the only thing
          that could give my life any
          meaning...

                         PIKUL
          But why is it my fault? I'm
          telling you, I didn't, I did not
          neural-surge. I didn't. I didn't
          feel any surging.
          Gas strolls into the garage, still wearing his work gloves,
          which now hold an agricultural-looking shotgun. It is
          levelled at Geller.

                         GAS
          It isn't your fault. It's my
          fault.
          Pikul looks at Gas in disbelief. His feet begin to writhe in
          circles, but he still can't get out of the chair; Geller
          backs away from Gas, clutching her pod protectively.

                         GELLER

                         (QUIETLY)
          Oh, no, Gas, not you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3=

                         GAS
          I wouldn't try to use that
          bioport again, `cept maybe for a
          toaster or something.

                         GELLER
          What's going on?

                         GAS
          You're worth a lot of money. If
          you're dead.

                         PIKUL
          What are you talking about?

                         GAS
          You know what I'm talking about.
          It's all over the countryside.
          Five million for her dead body.
          No questions asked.

                         PIKUL
          But, but... she changed your
          life.

                         GAS
          Yup. And now I'm gonna change
          hers.

                         PIKUL

                         (STALLING)
          But wait... Why did you install a
          bad port into me?

                         GAS
          Seems there's a big bonus for
          killing Allegra Geller's latest
          game, or whatever it is. I think
          I just did that, didn't I?
          Geller decides to try another tack. She stops backing away
          and begins to slowly approach Gas.

                         GELLER
          But can you kill a person? Can
          you do that, Gas? Can you kill
          me? Hide my body. Contact the
          crazies. Trust them to pay up.
          Hand over my now-decaying,
          fucking grotesque corpse. Really
          expect them to hand over 5 mil
          cash? Don't you ever go to the
          fuckin' movies?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GAS
          I like your script. I want to be
          in it.
          Gas cocks his shotgun. He's really going to do it. Except
          that Pikul shoots him right in the mastoid bone, just behind
          the ear, with the bioport insertion gun. The back of Gas's
          skull shatters and he goes down hard. Pikul drops the gun
          and launches himself out of his chair. He falls to his knees
          beside Gas's body.

                         PIKUL
          Oh, God, I think he's dead. I
          thought I could just distract
          him.

                         GELLER
          You did distract him.
          (to Gas's body)
          Plug your toaster into that hole,
          corpse!

          INT. DEFENDER - NIGHT

          Geller drives. Pikul hangs on in the passenger seat.

                         PIKUL
          He wanted to kill you.

                         GELLER
          Yep.

                         PIKUL
          That's two people in one day who
          wanted to actually kill you.

                         GELLER
          I've never been more popular.

                         PIKUL
          Allegra, we need help.

                         GELLER
          You're right. I've got to get
          this pod fixed.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          The Defender winds its way up a heavily wooded mountain
          road.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. CALEDON SKI CLUB - DAY

          The Defender turns off a dirt road and rumbles through an
          open gate. The stone gateposts bear a coy rustic sign which
          reads, CALEDON SKI CLUB - PRIVATE ROAD.

          INT. DEFENDER - DAY


                         PIKUL
          We're going skiing?

                         GELLER
          Nothing in the countryside is
          what it seems. It's all
          appearance versus reality, and
          the reality here is something
          unique.

          EXT. CALEDON SKI CLUBHOUSE - DAY

          The Defender pulls up beside the chalet-style ski clubhouse.
          As they get out of the truck, the same bizarre insect that
          Geller was playing with the night before lands on the
          truck's side mirror, narrowly missing Pikul as it flops
          around in the air.

                         PIKUL
          Look at that huge bug. It's got
          two heads.

                         GELLER '
          They breed them here. They're not
          supposed to get away.
          They get out and walk towards the clubhouse.

                         PIKUL
          What if somebody comes up here
          and really wants to ski?

                         GELLER
          Nobody actually physically skis
          any more, Pikul. You know that.

                         PIKUL
          I've watched some ski shows.
          Downhill racing, Austrian Alps.

                         GELLER

                         (CONTEMPTUOUSLY)
          Yeah, right.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. CALEDON SKI CLUBHOUSE - DAY

          Pikul and Geller enter the clubhouse. There is nobody
          around. It looks like a real ski clubhouse, complete with
          racks of ski pants and ski boots. But when Pikul examines
          the goods, he can see that they're old and cracked and
          falling apart. They've been there for years. `
          A man comes out of a back room, early sixties, authoritarian
          air, eastern-European. He is Kiri Vinokur, and he lights up
          when he sees Geller.

                         VINOKUR
          My darling Allegra. I am so
          pleased to see you here.
          They embrace.

                         GELLER
          Kiri Vinokur, this is my
          bodyguard, Ted Pikul.

                         VINOKUR
          Hello, yes, I heard the
          ridiculous story about this fatwa
          against you. The company is
          desperately trying to find you.
          Is it really serious? Are you in
          danger?

                         PIKUL
          If I'm her bodyguard, then she's
          in grave danger.

                         GELLER
          There have been a couple of
          attempts on my life already.

                         VINOKUR

                         (SHOCKED)
          No! That's unbearable. The
          company must stop this. They owe
          you every kind of protection.

                         GELLER
          I don't know if they can do
          anything about it. It seems to be
          open season on me.

          VINOKUR ,
          Well, you will be safe here, I
          can assure you of that. I will
          contact Antenna right away and
          have them send some people to
          come and collect you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          Kiri, no, don't. You mustn't let
          anybody know we're here unless
          you have to. I can't be sure that
          Antenna is completely safe for
          me.

                         VINOKUR
          I understand. Yes. The company
          draws many eccentric people into
          its fold. You can hide in one of
          the guest chalets. As long as you
          like. I will make sure you get
          fresh towels...
          Geller pats her game-pod case.

                         GELLER
          .and make sure I don't lose
          everything I have in here.

          INT. WORKSHOP CHALET - DAY

          In the strange atmosphere of the workshop chalet, Vinokur is
          taking Geller's pod apart. It is more like surgery on an
          alien life form than computer electronics. The room feels
          like a weird combination of a hi-tech operating room and a
          woodworking class.
          A cherubic middle-aged man - Landry - who looks more like a
          farmhand than an electronics technician, assists Vinokur as
          he works.

                         VINOKUR
          What did you port into?

                         GELLER
          Pikul's bioport.

                         VINOKUR
          Really? That's what did all the
          damage?

                         PIKUL
          It was a flawed installation - my
          first. It... it neural-surged.
          Allegra says you can fix it.

                         VINOKUR
          It fried some very expensive
          nerve boards. See? Here. These
          are kaput. It's a complex thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Nerve boards?

                         VINOKUR
          We use the nervous systems of
          specially-bred insects to create
          the electronic circuits on our
          motherboards.

                         (SMILES)
          Only Antenna Research has it.

                         PIKUL
          Wow. And where do the batteries
          go?

                         VINOKUR
          Very funny.

                         GELLER
          He's not kidding. He's a total PR
          nerd.

                         (TO PIKUL)
          It ports into you, and you are
          the power source. Your body, your
          nervous system. Your energy. When
          you get tired, run down, it won't
          run properly.

                         VINOKUR
          Landry here will finish up the
          pod-work. Meanwhile...

                         (TO PIKUL)
          Let's get that nasty bioport out
          of you and get a nice, fresh one
          in there. We have guest chalets
          out back. You're both welcome to
          stay. Now where did I put my
          bioport-plug puller..? Here it
          is.
          Vinokur hauls out a device that looks like a pair of spring-
          loaded fire tongs.

                         VINOKUR

                         (TO PIKUL)
          Lie down on that couch and pull
          up your shirt.

          INT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

          In their chalet, a cozy and inn-like'space, Pikul and Geller
          examine his new bioport while sitting on one of the chalet's
          twin beds. The region around the port looks swollen, bruised
          and tender.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          It hurts. I think it's infected.

                         GELLER
          It's not infected. It's just
          excited. It wants action.
          She attempts to jack her pod into his port using the Y-
          shaped UmbyCord, but he twists away from her.

                         PIKUL
          But I really don't think that I
          want action. Me, I mean. The
          bearer of the excited bioport.
          What I want is... not now. Not
          here. I feel too... too exposed.
          Geller sighs, then switches into her explaining-the-facts-
          of-life-to-a-child mode. They are both aware that they are
          replaying an earlier moment.

                         GELLER
          (cradling her pod)
          My baby here has now taken three
          major hits, one in the church,
          one in the gas station, and one
          on the operating table. The only
          way I can tell if everything's OK
          - the game's not been
          contaminated, the pod's not
          fucked - is to play eXistenZ with
          somebody friendly. Are you
          friendly, or are you not?
          Pikul swallows nervously, then turns his back to Geller so
          that she can port in.

                         PIKUL
          You're telling me this thing will
          run off my body's energy?

                         GELLER

                         (PORTING IN)
          That's how they work. See? You're
          hummin' along already.
          Sure enough, he is. Geller deftly twists the second jack
          into her own bioport and takes a deep breath.

                         GELLER
          All right. eXistenZ. Only from
          Antenna. Here we go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL

                         (APPREHENSIVE)
          You've got a bit of an unfair
          advantage, don't you? How can I
          possibly compete with the
          designer of the system?

                         GELLER
          You could beat the guy who
          invented poker, couldn't you?
          Geller flicks the game-pod nipple, and the chalet begins to
          melt away around them.

          INT. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          The chalet melts away and is replaced by a scruffy game
          store. A lot of kids and strange adults mill around amongst
          the dusty racks and pinball machines, examining packages of
          weird games and game devices, muttering secretively to each
          other, and it is amongst these dull rows of shelves that
          Pikul and Geller find themselves standing.
          A cashier works away behind an old-fashioned cash register
          that sits on a tall counter. The cashier, a gangly, sallow
          young man, glances at Pikul and Geller suspiciously from
          time to time.
          Pikul feels himself', his clothes, moves his arms, his
          tongue. He feels around behind him but there is no game-pod
          or UmbyCord in sight.

                         PIKUL
          That was beautiful. I feel...
          just like me. Is that kind of
          transition normal, a kind of
          smooth dissolve from place to
          place?

                         GELLER
          Depends on the style of the game.
          You can get jagged, brutal cuts,
          slow fades, shimmering little
          morphs...

                         PIKUL
          This is amazing. I had no idea.
          We... we're still ourselves, but
          we're in the game. Where are we?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          It's basically a game store I
          used to hang out in as a kid.

                         PIKUL

                         4

                         (ENCHANTED)
          Are you serious?

                         GELLER
          We're ported into a game-pod
          together, remember? eXistenZ has
          complete access to both our
          central nervous systems. Its game
          architecture will be based on our
          memories, our anxieties, our
          preoccupations...

                         PIKUL

                         (DISENCHANTED)
          Are you serious?

                         GELLER
          You keep saying that.
          (examines a game-pak)
          Look at this. Games I've never
          heard of. Biological Father. Hit
          By A Car. Viral Ecstasy. Chinese
          Restaurant.
          (reads pak back)
          In Viral Ecstasy, you are a
          virus invading a specific human
          body. You create ingenious viral
          strategies to cope with the
          efforts of the body's immune
          system to destroy you..."

                         PIKUL
          Wait a minute. That reminds me.
          What precisely is the goal of the
          game we're playing now? I mean,
          the rules, the objective...
          Nobody's ever really said
          anything about what you have to
          do in eXistenZ.

                         GELLER
          The beauty of eXistenZ is that it
          changes every time you play it.
          It adapts to the individuals who
          are actually playing it. The
          result is that you have to play
          the game to find out why you're
          playing the game.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          But that's kind of cheating,
          isn't it? Not to say confusing.

                         GELLER
          Not at all. It's a much more
          organic approach to gaming than
          classic, arbitrary, rule-
          dominated games. It's the future,
          Pikul. You'll see how natural it
          feels.

                         PIKUL

                         (DISTRACTED)
          Look at this. Could this be the
          future too?
          (picks up a game-pod)
          Ever see anything like this
          before?
          They are looking at a game-pod in a gel-pak that is even
          weirder than a tissue-pod. It has a logo and a name -

          CORTICAL SYSTEMATICS.
          Suddenly, a hand reaches into the frame and takes the pak
          away, puts it neatly back on the rack.
          Pikul and Geller look up at a man in his early fifties,
          graying, thinning hair, beefy, generally harried and
          pugnacious air. The man is Dorsey Nader.

                         NADER
          These are delicate. You have to
          be careful.

                         PIKUL
          Yes. I can imagine.

                         NADER
          Cortical Systematics is the
          latest and the hottest. Not just
          a new game, but a new system.

                         GELLER
          Will it work with an industry
          standard bioport?

                         NADER
          (ignores her question)
          I haven't seen you two before,
          have I? This is my place.
          Haimische, isn't it? Funky?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          PIKUI,
          We're new in town.

                         NADER
          Welcome to Dorsey Nader's Game
          Emporium. I'm Dorsey Nader. Is
          there anything I can help you
          with?

                         GELLER
          We're just looking.

                         NADER

                         (FURTIVELY)
          I have what you're looking for.

                         PIKUL
          You do?

                         NADER
          Follow me.
          Nader turns his back on them and walks to the back of the
          store. He stops at a warped and dirty door, turns, beckons
          to them urgently, trying not to be noticed by the
          preoccupied patrons.
          As Pikul and Geller follow Nader through the door, they do
          not escape the notice of the sour-faced young cashier, who
          writes something down hurriedly on a pad with an air of
          vengeful self-importance.

          INT. STOCKROOM. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          Pikul and Geller find themselves in a stockroom jammed to
          overflowing with packaged and naked game-related
          merchandise. They are alone with Nader, and they are all
          sitting on wooden crates.
          Nader rummages on the shelves behind him for a moment, then
          turns back to them with a gel-pak in his hands. He studies
          them for a moment, hefting the gel-pak in his hand.

                         NADER

                         (PAUSE)
          Who sent you?

                         PIKUL

                         (INSTANT RESPONSE)
          It's none of your businesz who
          sent us. We're here, and that's
          all that matters.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pikul is shocked at his own response. He turns to Geller in
          horror, worried that he's blown the game already.

                         PIKUL
          Oh God, what happened? I didn't
          mean to say that!

                         GELLER

                         (GIGGLING)
          It's your character who said it.
          It's a kind of schizophrenic
          feeling, isn't it? But you'll get
          used to it. There are things that
          have to be said to advance the
          plot and establish the
          characters, and those things get
          said whether you want to say them
          or not. Don't fight it. Just go
          with it.

                         PIKUL
          But should you be saying that in
          front of him? Nader?

                         GELLER
          Look at him.
          Pikul does. Nader doesn't seem to have heard him. In fact,
          he doesn't respond at all other than to hum the Antenna
          Research corporate-song and tap his fingers repetitively,
          caught in a small behavioural loop. Geller chuckles at
          Pikul's confusion.

                         PIKUL

                         (RE NADER)
          What's he doing?

                         GELLER
          He's gone into a game loop, he's
          locked up, and he won't come out
          of it until you give him a proper
          game line of dialogue.

                         PIKUL
          This is tricky.

                         GELLER
          Start by repeating your last
          line. Include his name so he
          knows you're talking.to him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         4-

                         PIKUL
          We're here, Dorsey Nader, and
          that's all that matters.
          Nader immediately comes out of his loop. He chuckles.

                         NADER
          You're right. That is all tha 
          matters.
          Pikul smiles, delighted. Now he takes a deep breath, closes
          his eyes, relaxes. The line comes.

                         PIKUL
          Well, Nader, you said you had
          what we want. We're waiting.

                         NADER
          You're going to need these micro-
          pods to download your new
          identities. I assume that you
          both have had those industry
          standard bioports you mentioned
          installed.

                         GELLER
          Yes, of course, that's right. We
          both have bioports.
          Here she pauses, looks at Pikul.

                         GELLER
          We do, don't we?

                         PIKUL
          I assumed we did. I mean, here.
          In the game. Of course, we might
          not.

                         GELLER
          We'd better check.
          While Nader goes into game lock-up, Geller lifts up her
          shirt. Pikul takes a look. Her bioport is there, although
          slightly rougher, puckered, more organic than in non-game
          life.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, it's there. Looks a little
          different, but it's there.
          Geller grabs Pikul's shirt and lifts it. His is there too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          I see what you mean.

                         (TO NADER)
          Yes, we both have bioports.

                         NADER

                         (UNLOCKING)
          Good. Port in and this'll tell
          you all you need to know for now.
          Pikul and Geller examine the pak, which bears the Cortical
          Systematics name and logo. It seems to be a miniature
          version of their real-life game-pod.

                         NADER
          I'm going to leave while you
          finish up here. It wouldn't be
          good for us all to be seen
          together.
          Nader gets up to leave, pauses at the door.

                         NADER
          Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
          Nader chuckles a very theatrical chuckle, then leaves.

                         PIKUL
          I assume that Nader is our entry
          point into the game.

                         GELLER
          Yeah. Kinda disappointing.

                         PIKUL
          Nader?

                         GELLER
          Yeah. Not a very well-drawn
          character. And his dialogue was
          just so-so.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah.

                         (PAUSE)
          Do we blame ourselves for that?
          The bad dialogue? Or would it be
          bad no matter who was ported in?

                         GELLER
          The game engine is just getting
          used to us. It'll get more daring
          once it warms up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         49
          Geller fumbles the micro-pod out of its vacuum-pak shell.
          She reads the instructions on the back.

                         GELLER
          OK. The pods are so small they
          plug directly into the bioport.
          Geller delicately twists the end of the micro-pod into
          Pikul's bioport. The micro-pod changes colour, pulses,
          ripples, and then slowly flows and wriggles its way into
          Pikul's bioport until it has completely disappeared.

                         GELLER
          God!

                         PIKUL
          What happened?

                         GELLER
          The whole pod just disappeared
          into your back.

                         PIKUL

                         (PANICKY)
          It disappeared into my back?!
          It... it's in my spine? It's
          winding its way around my spinal
          cord?

                         GELLER
          Don't panic, it's just a game. Do
          you feel anything yet?

                         PIKUL
          (controlling his fear)
          No, I don't. Not a thing. I don't
          feel a thing. Uh, do you want me
          to do you?
          They change positions. Pikul ports in the micro-pod and it
          duly crawls its way into Geller's bioport. Tenderly, as
          though kissing a cut to make it better, Pikul kisses her
          back, low near her bioport. Geller whirls around with sudden
          anger.

                         GELLER
          What the hell was that?

                         PIKUL

                         (CONFUSED)
          That wasn't me. That was my game
          character. I wouldn't have done
          that. Not here, anyway.
          She pauses, then kisses him on the mouth, hard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          You're right. Our characters are
          obviously supposed to jump on
          each other. Probably to create
          emotional tension when danger
          happens. No use fighting it.

                         PIKUL

                         (FIGHTING IT)
          What about our new identities? Do
          you feel yours yet?

                         GELLER

                         (CARESSING)
          They'll take care of themselves.

                         PIKUL

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm very worried about my body.
          Geller stops, sits up.

                         GELLER
          Your what?

                         PIKUL
          I mean, where are our real
          bodies? Are they all right? Are
          they hungry? What if there's
          danger?

                         GELLER
          (kissing and caressing

                         AGAIN)
          They're just where we left them,
          sitting quietly, eyes closed.
          Just like meditating.

                         PIKUL
          (reluctantly kissing and

                         CARESSING BACK)
          I don't know. I feel really
          vulnerable. Disembodied.

                         GELLER
          Don't sweat it. All your senses
          are still operating. You'll pop
          right out of the game if there's
          a problem.
          They begin to make seriously hot love amrngst the game paks
          and cartons of replacement UmbyCords. And then the game
          store melts away around them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

          Pikul finds himself sitting at an immensely long bench in
          the process of assembling insect motherboards along with
          many other workers. Pikul can still feel the warmth of
          Geller's body, but she's nowhere to be seen. A gritty,
          narrow conveyor belt runs down the middle of the bench, upon
          which floats an endless stream of motherboard parts which
          the workers pick off as they need them. The belt begins and
          ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building.
          The place, a high-ceilinged pre-fab, long and narrow with
          hundreds of blanked-out windows, houses a game-pod assembly
          line. Pikul looks down to find himself wearing a photo-ID
          card clipped to his shirt pocket that tells him he is
          somebody named LARRY ASHEN. He has to twist the card around
          because, of course, from his vantage point it is upside
          down.

                         NOURISH
          Tryin' to remember who you are?
          Pikul snaps his head up to see a long-haired, morose-looking
          worker sitting next to him, snickering. Mocking Pikul, he
          twists his own card around, comically bunching up his work
          shirt so he can read his own name, which is YEVGENY NOURISH.

                         NOURISH
          Hey, it works! I must be Yevgeny
          Nourish!
          Nourish leans over to squint at Pikul's name tag.

                         NOURISH
          And you... you are new to the
          Trout Farm.

                         PIKUL
          Yes. I... I'm... very new. Did
          you say trout farm?

                         NOURISH
          You know - raise baby trout from
          eggs and then stock the rivers
          with them.

                         (BROAD GESTURE)
          Entire place used to be a trout
          farm. Seems like most everything
          used to be something else,
          doesn't it?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pikul looks around him. The place is humming, but Geller is
          still nowhere in sight. The workers are small-town locals o_Â°
          a wide range of ages.
          Pikul looks down at his own hands, which seem to,know what
          to do: place glue on the boards, glue them down to a resin
          frame using a template, insert needle-like electrodes into
          the bodies of certain epoxied insects. The insect boards,
          Pikul notes, are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and
          frozen together like a sick collage. At least, here in the
          game they are.
          Pikul is now automatically doing flashy moves with the odd
          materials in front of him with great dexterity. Nourish
          takes note of this.

                         NOURISH
          I (with admiration)
          You might be new but you seem to
          know what you're doing.

                         PIKUL

                         (GENUINELY PERPLEXED)
          It surprises me more than it
          surprises you.
          Nourish moves back to the insect motherboard that he has
          been working on, then leans over again exactly as he did the
          first time. It has the effect of an instant replay, but not
          in slow-motion.

                         NOURISH

                         (WITH ADMIRATION)
          You might be new but you seem to
          know what you're doing.
          Pikul realizes he hasn't given the right answer. He now just
          lets it come without thinking.

                         PIKUL
          I, ah... I've been trained by the
          very best.
          Nourish unlocks and looks around with a delicate
          furtiveness.

                         NOURISH

                         (FURTIVE)
          So have I. Where do you plan to
          have lunch?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          I'm new here. I have no plans for
          lunch.

                         NOURISH 11
          I suggest the Chinese restaurant
          in the forest. Everybody knows
          where it is. Just ask.

                         PIKUL
          Won't you be going there too?

                         NOURISH
          I have other plans for lunch. But
          I do suggest that you order the
          special. And don't take no for an
          answer.

                         PIKUL
          All right, I'll do that.
          Nourish turns back to his task and begins to work away as
          though Pikul didn't exist.
          Pikul takes this cue to go back to his own board and is soon
          preoccupied with testing the board's circuits by porting it
          into a test UmbyCord that uncoils from the center of the
          bench. His strange reverie, watching himself work on auto-
          pilot at this bizarre task, is soon interrupted by a worker
          pushing a canvas and metal cart with bicycle wheels. The
          worker parks the cart behind Pikul and taps him on the
          shoulder.

                         WORKER
          Larry?

                         PIKUL

                         (STARTLED)
          Yes?

                         WORKER
          They need this in the back room.
          They asked for you.
          The worker shuffles off, leaving the cart behind him. Pikul
          turns to Nourish.

                         PIKUL
          What's that mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         NOURISH

                         (GESTURES)
          It means that they want you in
          the back room. They need more
          insect boards for the pod
          assembly bays.

                         PIKUL
          Should I just get up and go
          there?

                         NOURISH
          Yeah. I'll take care of your
          incoming boards.
          Pikul gets up to go. Nourish grabs him by the arm and
          whispers intensely.

                         NOURISH
          Remember. The Chinese restaurant
          for lunch.

                         PIKUL
          I order the special.

          INT. TROUT FARM. POD ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY

          Pikul enters the huge back wing of the Trout Farm and walks
          along a rampway, pushing his cart past the pod assembly-bay
          area. There, pods very much like the one he and Geller are
          ported into back home are being assembled - motherboards
          inserted, internal ports connected, fleshy housings like the
          corpses of small amphibians sewn up - by small teams of
          workers.
          The bays themselves are old horse stalls with straw still
          covering the dirt floors. But because the pods are primarily
          organic, the teams are more like groups of masked surgical
          workers in a series of impossibly small and filthy operating
          rooms than, let's say, auto-assembly teams in a progressive
          Saab plant.
          As Pikul wheels his cart past each stall, he digs into the
          cart's canvas bag and delivers insect boards wrapped in
          brown wax paper to the eagerly awaiting pod teams.
          In the last bay, one of the masked surgeons grabs him by the
          hand instead of taking the proferred motherboard pnd leads
          himm to an isolated corner. Her ID card says she is BARB
          BRECKEN, and her photo says she is Geller.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          GELLER,
          (slipping off her mask)
          I saw you make contact, Larry
          Ashen. What did the guy on the .l
          assembly line say to you?
          Pikul's expression shows that there is a return game line
          welling up in his mouth, tickling his tongue, perhaps.
          Perversely, he fights it, but it comes out anyway.

                         PIKUL
          He told me where to have lunch.

          EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          A ragged stream of pod-assembly workers trickles along a
          densely wooded gravel path towards a very un-Chinese
          Victorian red-brick farmhouse. A small river flows not more
          than fifty feet from the restaurant, mimicking the movement
          of the line of workers.
          The workers all file past a sign on the lawn in front of the
          building which reads, MONA ZHANG'S BEIJING CUISINE.

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          Pikul and Geller are seated at a round Formica-covered table
          with a lazy Susan serving wheel in the centre of it, all
          very Mandarin in style. Other workers sit sullenly at their
          table, wordless, suspicious.
          A restaurant dog, a mongrel with a lot a heavy, collie-like
          fur, lies basking in a pane of sunlight. in a corner.
          The waiter, a young, athletic Chinese man, comes over
          bringing rice and tea.

                         WAITER
          We have nice sea bass today.
          Shall I bring it for everyone?
          Pikul and Geller exchange a look. Pikul shrugs OK.

                         PIKUL
          We want the special.
          The waiter looks stunned. The others at their table look
          distressed. The waiter seems to lock up, almost freeze-
          framed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Did you hear me, Chinese waiter?

                         (SLOWLY)
          We want the special.
          The waiter unfreezes, smiles grimly.

                         WAITER
          The special is for special
          occasions. I cannot give you the
          special.

                         PIKUL
          But this is a special occasion.
          It's...
          Pikul pauses, waiting for the proper game line to
          materialize in his mouth. Finally, it does. He gestures
          towards Geller.

                         PIKUL
          It's her birthday.
          The waiter locks up for a moment, then unfreezes.

                         WAITER
          A birthday is a special occasion.
          I will therefore bring the
          special for everybody.
          The waiter walks away. The others at the table get up and
          move away, drift over to other tables with occasional
          furtive backward glances at Pikul and Geller.

                         PIKUL
          I guess the special isn't very
          popular.

                         GELLER
          I guess.

                         PIKUL
          But you know, really, don't you?
          You don't have to guess. I mean,
          it's your game, your little
          universe.

                         GELLER
          I don't know. You have to
          understand that, to understand
          what we've really created with
          eXistenZ.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          You're telling me, for example,
          that you don't know what the
          special is?

                         GELLER
          Correct. I don't.

                         PIKUL
          Or why we ordered it.

                         GELLER
          We ordered it because another
          game character told you to.
          That's a clue we can't ignore.
          But that's just basic games
          playing.

                         PIKUL
          I want to put the game on pause.
          Geller just looks at him, puzzled. Pikul panics.

                         PIKUL

                         (PANICKING)
          The game can be paused, can't it?
          I mean, all games can be paused,
          right?

                         GELLER
          Sure, yeah, but why? What's
          wrong? Aren't you dying to see
          what's special about the special?

                         PIKUL
          I'm feeling a little disconnected
          from my real life. I'm kind of
          losing touch with the texture of
          it, you know what I mean? I mean,
          I actually think there's an
          element of psychosis involved
          here. I mean, I don't know where
          my body really is, or where
          reality is, what I've actually
          done, or not done.

                         GELLER
          That's a great sign. It means
          your nervous system is fully
          engaging with the game
          architecture. The game is a lot
          more fun when it starts to feel
          realer than real.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL

                         (PAUSE)
          Yeah.
          Pikul stands up and screams at the top of his lungs.

                         PIKUL

                         (SCREAMS)
          eXistenZ is paused!
          The Chinese restaurant melts away.

          INT. GUEST CHALET - DAY

          The guest chalet melts back up around them. Pikul looks
          around. They are still sitting on the bed, ported into
          Geller's pod together.

                         PIKUL
          Did I do that? I guess I did.

                         GELLER
          So how does it feel?

                         PIKUL
          What?

                         GELLER
          Your real life. The one you came
          back for.

                         PIKUL
          Just sitting here, it feels
          completely unreal. I'm sure you
          knew that would happen.

                         GELLER
          You're stuck now, aren't you? You
          want to go back to the Chinese
          restaurant because there's
          nothing happening here. We're
          safe. It's boring.

                         PIKUL
          Worse than that. I'm not sure
          here, where we are, is real at
          all. This feels like the game.
          And you... you're beginning to
          t1 feel a bit like a game character
           to me.

                          (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL (CONT'D)

                         (PAUSE)
          Did we really make love to each
          other?

                         4

                         GELLER

                         (SHARP)
          Definitely not.

                         PIKUL
          It feels like we did.

                         GELLER
          Our characters did. I'm sure it
          would be very different if we
          did.

                         PIKUL
          I... I'm actually just like that
          in real life. You got the real
          Ted Pikul there, in the stockroom
          of the game store.

                         GELLER
          Well, you didn't get the real
          Allegra Geller, I can tell you
          that. no

                         PIKUL
          I didn't?
          She kisses him gently.

                         GELLER
          No. In real life I tend to lose
          control. It can get messy.

                         (PAUSE)
          Let's go back.
          Pikul looks down at the pod. He flicks the PLAY nipple. The
          room melts down around them and is replaced by the Chinese
          restaurant.

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          Pikul and Geller are back at their table in the Chinese
          restaurant. The waiter is approaching their table. He
          proudly sets down a series of dishes on the lazy Susan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         6C

                         WAITER
          Special order for the birthday
          girl. Hope you enjoy it very
          much.
          In the dishes are a variety of cooked reptiles, amphibians,
          fish and birds, all weirdly mutated and presented in a
          bizarrely beautiful fashion.

                         PIKUL
          I think I've lost my appetite.

                         WAITER
          A shame. Mutant creatures provide
          new and previously unimagined
          taste sensations.

                         (SIGNIFICANTLY)
          Shall I clear all this away?
          Geller sees that this is a crucial game moment.

                         GELLER
          No, it looks terrific. Thank you.
          We're happy.
          The waiter nods.

                         WAITER
          Very good. Enjoy.
          The waiter leaves. Geller watches him go, suspicious. When
          she turns back to Pikul, she is shocked to see that he has
          served out most of the creatures to himself and is avidly
          stripping the meat off their bones.

                         GELLER
          Pikul, what are you doing?

                         PIKUL
          I don't know. I find this
          disgusting but I can't help
          myself.

                         GELLER
          Oh, good!
          Pikul looks up from his big bowl, which is rapidly filling
          with creature parts. His fingers are'slimy and sticky, but
          he doesn't stop, his fingers working expertly on their own.

                         PIKUL
          Good? You think this is good?

                         ( AM-

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         O:

                         GELLER
          Yeah. It's a genuine game urge.
          It's something that your game
          character was born to do. Don't
          fight it.

                         PIKUL
          I am fighting it, but it isn't
          doing me any good.
          Pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone,
          gristle and flesh, a grotesque Lego set. When he's finished,
          he's made a gun very much like the one that was used in the
          attempted assassination in the church.

                         PIKUL
          Omigod, this looks awfully
          familiar. You sure this is OK?

                         GELLER

                         (NOT SURE)
          It should be OK.
          Now Pikul reaches into his mouth, pulls out a bridge of
          three teeth - one of them gold-filled - and loads them into
          the gristly magazine.

                         GELLER
          Do you have that bridge in real
          life?

                         PIKUL
          Absolutely not. My teeth are
          perfect. Don't ask me how I knew
          this thing was in my mouth.

                         GELLER
          It probably wasn't until you
          ordered the special.
          He slaps the magazine into the handle, then pulls the slide
          back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in
          the chamber.
          Then with a smile, Pikul points the weapon at Geller.

                         PIKUL

                         (CASUALLY)
          Death to the demoness Allegra
          Geller.

                         GELLER
          (suddenly very uncertain)
          That's not funny!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pikul looks at Geller and sees that there is genuine terror
          in her eyes.

                         PIKUL
          Sorry, I couldn't resist. But you
          know... I do feel the urge to
          kill someone here.
          Geller grips the edge of her bowl of hot-and-sour soup - the
          handiest weapon she has.

                         GELLER

                         (TENSING)
          Who?

                         PIKUL
          I need to kill our waiter.

                         GELLER

                         (RELIEVED)
          Oh, well, that makes sense.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Waiter! Waiter!

                         (TO PIKUL)
          When he comes over, do it. Don't
          hesitate.

                         PIKUL
          But everything in this game is so
          realistic. I don't think I really
          could...

                         GELLER
          You won't be able to stop. You
          might as well enjoy it.

                         PIKUL
          "Free will" is obviously not a
          big factor in this little world
          of ours.

                         GELLER
          It's like real life - there's
          just enough to make it
          interesting.
          - Pikul spots the waiter making his way across the room
          towards them, a big smile on his face.

                         PIKUL
          He's too nice. I won't do it.
          The waiter arrives at their table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         53

                         WAITER
          What can I do to make your lunch
          more pleasant?
          Pikul lifts the gun and points it at the waiter.

                         4

                         PIKUL
          I found this in my soup and I'm
          very upset.
          Pikul fires. The tooth-bullet hits the waiter in the
          cheekbone. A chunk of the waiter's cheekbone comes off and
          his head jerks back like a fighter taking a stiff jab.
          The waiter's sweet face instantly transforms into a hideous,
          angry, snarling mask of hatred. He pulls a meat cleaver out
          of his jacket.
          Geller immediately throws her bowl of hot-and-sour soup into
          the waiter's face. The waiter screams, then wildly wipes the
          noodles and goop out of his eyes. He raises the cleaver over
          his head.
          The waiter swings and lunges across the table, managing only
          to hack the tip of the gun off. Pikul is shocked to see the
          gun begin to bleed. The waiter, sprawling across the table,
          screams as he tries to reach Geller with his cleaver. Pikul

          44.
          fires into the waiter's shrieking, open mouth - a tooth-
          bullet into teeth.
          A piece of the waiter's skull comes off like a piece of
          coconut, the gold-filled tooth now flattened and embedded in
          it. The gun is bleeding all over Pikul's hand now. He drops
          it in disgust.
          The restaurant dog comes out of nowhere, picks the gun up,
          and runs off with it under a table, where he crouches down
          and starts to gnaw on it, growling.
          Pikul stands up shakily, begins to become aware of the
          strange, tense stillness of the other patrons in the
          restaurant.

                         PIKUL
          (loudly, to room)
          St's all right, just a little
          misunderstanding over the check.
          Pay no attention and enjoy your
          meal.
          To his surprise, the patrons actually turn back to their
          meals, albeit with a certain sinister reluctance.
          Pikul looks around wildly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          I feel a serious game urge to get
          out of here!
          Through the porthole in one of the pair of metal-clad
          kitchen doors, Geller spots someone wearing a che'f's hat,
          someone who is wildly beckoning to them.

                         GELLER
          Through the kitchen! That way!

          INT. KITCHEN. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

          Geller and Pikul enter the kitchen and take a look around.
          There are mutant amphibians and reptiles hung up everywhere,
          in bowls and on chopping blocks. The kitchen workers have
          all turned to look at the intruders.
          Suddenly, a cook steps forward from around the door. We can
          now see that it is Nourish in a chef's outfit.

                         NOURISH
          Did you like the meal I prepared
          for you?

                         PIKUL
          Yes. It was very... revealing.

                         NOURISH
          It certainly was for me. You both
          passed our little test with
          flying colours.

                         GELLER
          Why did the Chinese waiter have
          to die?

                         NOURISH
          A waiter hears many things spoken
          when people are relaxed and
          eating. A waiter has many
          opportunities for betrayal.

                         PIKUL
          He betrayed you?

                         NOURISH
          He betrayed us. Out this way,
          quickly!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          They go out a side door, and find themselves walking along
          the river that links the Chinese restaurant and the Trout
          Farm.

          EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

          The trio walk along the bank of the river that feeds the
          Trout Farm. Nourish points out a connected series of rock-
          lined, internally-lighted pools, some stagnant, like ponds,
          and some clear, with river water running through them.

                         NOURISH
          See there, the breeding pools.
          The pools are all alive with strange creatures, mutated
          fish, amphibians, and, along the small, muddy terraces that
          border the pools, reptiles. Like the dysfunctional insect at
          the gas station, these creatures do not work very well. They
          float and swim belly up, lie on their sides at the bottom of
          their pools, flop and flounder around, and in general,
          ostentatiously fail to function.

                         PIKUL
          Is that where you caught today's
          special?

                         NOURISH

                         (LAUGHS)
          The restaurant is controlled by
          us. We raise these mutant
          creatures as food and that is our
          cover, but of course, we are also
          raising them as components for
          undetectable and hypoallergenic
          weapons. Right under the noses of
          our enemies. And speaking of our
          enemies, it's important that you
          go back to work at Cortical
          Systematics. We need to maintain
          as many agents there as we can.
          I'll take care of the mess at the
          restaurant.

                         GELLER
          The Trout Farm is owned by
          Cortical Systematics?

                         NOURISH
          Yes.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         OC

                         NOURISH (CONT'D)

                         (BITTERLY)
          Their corporate slogan should be,
          "Enemies of Reality".
          A glazed look comes over Pikul. He begins to speak like a
          robotic orator.

                         PIKUL

                         (ROBOT-LIKE)
          Reality is a fragile thing. Most
          people think that reality must of
          course be the most solid thing,
          but it isn't. Reality is
          threatened now more than ever. It
          is being eroded and it is
          washing away in the deforming
          storm of non-reality, which
          masquerades as reality, and
          eventually replaces it. Deformed
          and crippled and limping and
          hideous, threatening to engulf us
          all.
          Geller looks at Pikul in admiring disbelief.

                         GELLER

                         (SOTTO VOCE)
          Where did that come from?

                         PIKUL
          The game made me do it.

                         GELLER
          I'm impressed.
          Nourish is also impressed. He smiles broadly, then takes
          Pikul in his arms and hugs him, then Geller.

                         NOURISH

                         (PASSIONATE)
          We love you two now, now that you
          have proven to be true and
          trustworthy Realists. We'll be in
          touch.
          Nourish turns around and walks back-towards the restaurant.

                         PIKUL
          "Enemies of Reality"? Or does it
          really mean, enemies of eXistenZ?
          Are the Realists the game-life
          version of the Anti-
          eXistenZialists, desperately
          want to kill you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         S'

                         GELLER
          I wouldn't take it too seriously.

                         PIKUL 1
          Of course you wouldn't. But maybe
          you should.

                         (PAUSE)
          But why is the name Cortical
          Systematics familiar?

                         GELLER
          We saw it everywhere in Dorsey
          Nader's game store, remember?

                         PIKUL
          Yes. So that makes it the game-
          life version of our own company.
          Cortical Systematics is
          equivalent to Antenna Research in
          the real world.

                         GELLER
          That's probably fair to say.

                         PIKUL
          So, then, do we meekly go back to
          work and say nothing? It sounds
          as though Nourish and his
          Realists are preparing to
          sabotage the Trout Farm. Before
          you know it, they'll be planning
          to assassinate game designers.

                         GELLER
          We're just characters in here.
          Don't mix your real-life
          loyalties into it or you'll lose
          for sure.

                         PIKUL
          Then what do we do next?

          INT. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          We are close on a Cortical Systematics logo on a game-pak.
          As Pikul and Geller pretend to examine the merchandise, they
          scan the game store for Nader. The store is quite crowded -
          same style of customers, maybe even some of the same faces,
          different clothes. They don't see Nader.
          Geller goes up to the cashier, the same gangly, sallow,
          bespectacled young man who was there the first time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         O;

                         GELLER
          I'm looking for Dorsey Nader. Is
          he here?

                         CASHIER
          Say that again?

                         GELLER
          Is Dorsey Nader here?
          The cashier glances around the store, then locks the
          register.

                         CASHIER
          Come with me. He's in the back.
          The cashier leads them through the store towards the
          stockroom door. As they move amongst the customers, both
          Pikul and Geller feel that they are being scutinized
          carefully by shoppers who turn their eyes away from them at
          the last moment, so that they can't be absolutely certain.
          And as for us - have we glimpsed some characters from the
          game that we have already seen? Possibly even Wittold Levi
          from the first scene in the church, and Frances the limo
          driver, and Gas? We aren't positive.

          INT. STOCKROOM. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          The cashier closes the door behind them, then gestures
          towards the back of the stockroom.

                         CASHIER
          You want him, there he is.
          Nader lies dead, the unnatural purple of his face eerily
          matched by the veiny purple streaks in the UmbyCord around
          his neck.

                         PIKUL
          Migod!

                         GELLER
          What happened?
          In response, the cashier starts rummaging around on one of
          the shelves. He soon finds what he was looking for, and
          turns around to face them. In his hand is a grotesque,
          slightly chewed gristle gun - the one Pikul assembled in the
          Chinese restaurant - in his hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CASHIER
          You shouldn't have killed the
          Chinese waiter.

                         PIKUL
          Why not?

                         CASHIER
          He was your contact at the Trout
          Farm. A damn good man.
          (pause; he waggles the gun)
          His dog brought me this.
          The cashier toys with the gun's claw-like hammer.

                         PIKUL
          But we were contacted there by
          Yevgeny Nourish. He seemed to
          know exactly who we were.

                         CASHIER
          That's because Nader tipped him
          off that you were coming. Nader
          was a mole for Cortical
          Systematics.

                         GELLER
          You're with the Realist
          underground.

                         CASHIER
          Yes. I was placed here to keep an
          eye on Nader.
          The cashier puts the gun back on the shelf.

                         PIKUL
          If Nourish isn't our real
          contact, who is he?

                         CASHIER
          Nourish is a double agent for
          Cortical Systematics. He was
          working with Nader to subvert the
          Realist cause, and doing it
          rather well.

                         (SNORTS CONTEMPTUOUSLY)
          After all, he got you to
          assassinate your own contact. But
          now you're going to put a stop to
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          We are?

                         CASHIER
          I assume that you both have had
          spinal port inserts, bioports,
          installed.

                         PIKUL
          We do.

                         CASHIER

                         (PASSIONATE)
          Do you both realize that neither
          of you can be buried on hallowed
          ground because of these... these
          mutilations? Does your bioport
          manual tell you that?

                         GELLER
          Are you trying to talk us into
          having them removed?

                         CASHIER
          No, no. In fact, you would be
          useless to us without them. We
          Realists are forbidden to have
          them, and so we have to use
          people like you on occasion.

                         GELLER
          I don't understand. Are you
          wanting us to jack a game into
          our bioports?

                         CASHIER
          Game? No. Not a game. A weapon.
          (a creepy smile)
          You go back to the Trout Farm,
          and in a familiar place, you find
          a mouldy old wicker basket with a
          thread-bare canvas cover.

                         PIKUL
          How will we know what to do?

                         CASHIER
          (an even creepier' smile)
          Even a child would know what to
          do.
          Someone begins to knock loudly on a door very near by. The
          cashier is oblivious, but'both Pikul and Geller hear it. The
          stockroom begins to morph away as its objects are replaced
          one at a time by chalet objects.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

          Someone is knocking at the chalet door.

          VINOKUR (0. S. )
          Sorry to interrupt you kids, but
          I thought you'd better have
          something to eat. We knocked on
          your door a few times to invite
          you to dinner...
          Pikul and Geller sit on the bed, game-pod between them,
          UmbyCord joining them to each other and to the pod. They
          look at each other. Pikul shrugs.

                         GELLER
          Come on in.
          The door opens slowly to reveal Vinokur, who stands there
          uncertainly, holding a large tray.

                         VINOKUR
          ..and when we got no answer, I
          figured you were playing eXistenZ
          to try out your new pod, and your
          new bioport. Everything's all
          right, I take it?
          An awkward moment, as though Vinokur has caught the pair
          having illicit sex. Vinokur moves into the room towards the
          table.

                         VINOKUR
          Can I leave this here for you?
          Don't bother unporting. I just
          had to be sure our star designer
          was in a good place and that
          she'd recovered her multi-
          million-dollar game system from
          her defective pod.
          Vinokur puts down the tray, which holds several plates
          covered by smaller, inverted plates to keep the food warm.

                         GELLER
          Thanks so much, Kiri. This is
          very sweet of you.

                         VINOKUR

                         I

                         (AWKWARD PAUSE)
          So I take it she has.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          Has what?

                         VINOXUR
          Recovered. eXistenZ.

                         GELLER
          Oh, yes, sure. That's why we're
          so spaced out.

                         (TO PIKUL)
          We were right into it, weren't
          we?

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, we were. And it's amazing.

                         VINOKUR
          Well, that's a relief. I'll leave
          you two alone. You can leave the
          tray outside your door when
          you're finished.

                         PIKUL
          What is that you've brought?

                         VINOKUR
          Believe it or not, it's Chinese
          food. There's a great Chinese
          restaurant on the other side of
          the escarpment road.
          Vinokur turns to go.

                         GELLER
          Kiri?

                         VINOKUR
          Yes?

                         GELLER
          Have you heard anything yet? I
          mean, about the eXistenZ test
          seminar and the shooting?

                         VINOKUR
          Oh, yes. It's come over all the
          media now. You've never been more
          famous. Your face is everywhere,
          which of course just.makes it
          worse. I...
          (a disturbed pause)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          What? Tell me.

                         VINOKUR
          They've announced the possibility
          that Antenna will delay the
          release of your new system
          indefinitely, until they can
          determine how widespread support
          for this fanatical group really
          is. I don't approve, myself. I
          don't think we should bend one
          degree to extremists.

                         GELLER
          Support for the fanatics? What
          does that mean?

                         VINOKUR
          Well, you know. They're all
          coming out of the woodwork now.

                         GELLER
          Who is?

                         VINOKUR
          (heavy, defeated sigh)
          A lot of people are taking the
          opportunity to jump on the anti-
          game bandwagon. They've now heard
          rumours about what the eXistenZ
          system is, and they say we've
          gone too far psychologically,
          medically, socially, you name it.
          And I'm afraid I wouldn't put it
          past our competitors to be
          involved in this, to try to whip
          up public opinion and kill our
          new system before it gets born.

                         (PAUSE)
          You're sure you don't want me to
          contact Antenna, even just to see
          what they have to say?

                         GELLER

                         (SHAKEN)
          Not yet, Kiri. Thanks.
          Vinokur smiles gently and leaves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          (gesturing towards the

                         DOOR)
          Your friend Vinokur is getting
          shaky. I think he's going to turn,
          you in to Antenna.

                         GELLER
          Sounds like you might approve of
          that.

                         PIKUL
          It might be the safest thing. Are
          you hungry?

                         GELLER
          Are you kidding?

                         PIKUL
          Me neither. I'm terrified to look
          under the plates.

                         (PAUSE)
          This "support for the fanatics"
          thing doesn't sound too good.
          Maybe we should stop...

                         GELLER
          We can't stop. I've been noticing
          some new... glitches. I'm not
          sure what they mean. I'm not sure
          the game is OK.

                         PIKUL

                         (GENTLY)
          Listen, to be honest, I find your
          game very confusing. I'm not sure
          I want to go back in there,
          because I'm not convinced I'm
          going to keep coming out. Do you
          really like that feeling?

                         GELLER

                         (WITH PASSION)
          Yeah, I love it.

                         (DELICIOUSLY MUSING)
          When eXistenZ is released, it's
          gonna wipe the competition off
          the face of the earth.

                         PIKUL
          Will it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          It really will do that, yes.

                         (HEAVY PAUSE)
          Don't hurt me, Pikul. Don't make
          me go back in alone. Play with
          me.

                         PIKUL
          Allegra, I'm worried that your
          game will wipe me off the face of
          the earth. I'm thinking I was
          right never to have a bioport
          installed.

                         GELLER
          (sly, quick smile)
          But you have one now. And you're
          ported in.
          She mischievously flicks the pod nipple, and the chalet
          melts away around them.

          INT. TROUT FARM SECURITY - DAY

          Trout-farm workers shuffle along a murky pre-fab corridor
          towards a smoke-enshrouded security checkpoint. A puffy-
          faced woman with a clipboard is walking down the lineup
          checking faces and ID cards. With her we discover Pikul and
          Geller, once again wearing their ID cards which identify
          them as LARRY ASHEN and BARB BRECKEN.

                         PIKUL
          That was cruel. I don't want to
          be here.

                         GELLER
          It wasn't cruel, it was
          desperate. C'mon, Pikul. You've
          just got a bad case of first-time
          user anxiety.

                         PIKUL
          I don't like it here. I don't
          know what's going on. We're
          blundering around together in
          this unformed world, whose rules
          and objectives are largely
          unknown, seemingly
          indecipherable, or even Possibly
          non-existent, always on the verge
          of being killed by forces we
          don't understand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          That sounds like my game, all
          right.
          They are now close enough to the security cubicle'at the end
          of the corridor to see the workers ahead of them being
          frisked by hand, then scanned by a wand similar to the one
          that Pikul used at the church.

                         PIKUL
          That sounds like a game that's
          not going to be easy to market.

                         GELLER

                         (LAUGHS)
          But it's a game that everybody's
          already playing! Existence, it's
          wonderful!

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

          Pikul and Geller have passed through security and now enter
          the assembly-line arena. They see Nourish at his accustomed
          place on the line, hunched over a pile of insect
          motherboards and now seeming, somehow, menacing, predatory
          in profile. The pair skirt the assembly-line area, carefully
          scanning as they go, but there is no wicker basket to be
          seen.

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY

          Pikul and Geller walk down the aisle connecting the assembly
          bays. Other workers drift casually in and out, preparing for
          their day in a desultory fashion.

                         PIKUL
          The cashier said it would be in a
          familiar place. Is there such a
          thing here?

                         GELLER
          My assembly bay.
          They make their way to the last assembly bay and slip inside
          it. There is, for the moment, nobody else there, but several
          pods have been left on the work tables half-assembled.
          Pikul spots it first, in the far corner: a large, mouldy
          wicker basket in the opposite corner. Something lumpy in it
          is covered by a thread-bare canvas sheet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Is that it over there?
          They stroll over to the basket. Geller kneels down and
          carefully begins to unwrap it while Pikul stands guard.

                         GELLER
          I'd say it's exactly as
          advertised.
          The final wrap comes off. In the basket is a necrotic,
          purpled, very diseased-looking pod.

                         PIKUL
          God, it's ugly. Even for a game-
          pod.

                         GELLER

                         (PAUSE)
          I have a terrible urge to port
          into it. What about you?

                         PIKUL
          (he thinks she's joking)
          Oh, sure. Yes. Desperate to port
          into it.
          Geller steps over to a bunch of UmbyCords draped over a peg
          and strips one off. She sits down on a rotting wooden
          folding chair next to the death-pod's basket and ports in
          one end of the UmbyCord.

                         GELLER
          Here we go. Wanna give me a hand?

                         PIKUL

                         (HORRIFIED)
          You're not serious! I mean,
          that's a diseased pod! Once you
          port into that, you become,
          you... you...

                         GELLER
          (a quick smile)
          Exactly. Help me.
          Pikul kneels beside her as she pulls up her shirt to reveal
          her bioport. Geller hands him the free end of the UmbyCord
          and he ports it into her.

                         PIKUL
          How long does it take for the
          infection to take hold?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          No time at all.

                         PIKUL
          And then you quietly port into
          all the other pods and spread the
          infection to them...

                         GELLER
          (pale, shaky)
          Oh, God!

                         PIKUL
          What's happening?

                         GELLER

                         F (SWOONING)
          Something's wrong!

                         PIKUL

                         (SUPPORTING HER)
          I'm gonna unport you now.
          Pikul tries to unport Geller, but her bioport has swollen
          and seized the jack. He gives the UmbyCord a tug.

                         GELLER
          (in sudden pain)
          0, God, don't! That really hurts!
          Pikul lets go. The death-pod, triggered off by Pikul's
          attempt to disconnect Geller, now begins to convulse in
          peristaltic waves in its wicker basket. Pikul looks around
          desperately and spots a clutch of tools hanging from nails
          on the wall.

                         PIKUL

                         (RISING)
          I'm going to cut you free!

                         GELLER
          No, don't, I'm afraid!
          But Pikul seizes a crude linoleum knife used for trimming
          oversized motherboards and, with three erratic slashes at
          the quivering UmbyCord, hacks her loose. Blood immediately
          pours out of both ends of the severed cord.

                         GELLER C
          (wide-eyed, quietly)
          Pikul. I'm bleeding to death.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          .9
          Panic-stricken, Pikul steps on Geller's end of the cord to
          stop the bleeding. It seems to work, but Geller moans
          horribly.

                         PIKUL

                         (TERRIFIED)
          I'm sorry! I don't know what else
          to do!

                         NOURISH
          I know what to do.
          Pikul twists awkwardly around to see Yevgeny Nourish
          standing just behind him. He is in the process of slipping a
          large propane torch off its wall hook.

                         NOURISH
          I know exactly what to do.
          Nourish unscrews the gas valve and ignites the torch.

                         NOURISH
          Death to Realism!
          Nourish turns the blazing torch on the pod in the basket.
          Where the cone of flame hits the pod, it begins to shrivel,
          crackle, sputter fat. The pod itself tries to ripple away
          from the searing flame as though it were alive. Nourish
          laughs and begins to play the cone over the entire surface
          of the pod.
          Geller sinks to the ground in exhaustion, holds on to
          Pikul's leg.
          The death-pod now swells and bubbles under the torch's
          flame, then explodes with a dull whump.

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

          A huge cloud, speckled black and gray, billows upwards and
          floats out over the intersecting walls of the stalls and
          into the main area of the Trout Farm's assembly line, where
          it begins to settle like granular. ash on the startled
          workers.

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY BAYS - NIGHT

          i Horrified, Nourish watches the thick cloud of infectious
          spores floating out of his reach.

                         NOURISH

                         (HORRIFIED)
          No, no!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         S:
          Gathering up her last shreds of energy, Geller suddenly
          shoves a startled Pikul off her cord and picks up the
          linoleum knife from where Pikul dropped it.
          Trailing her bloody cord, she lunges at Nourishi driving the
          rusty, curved blade into his back with great force. Nourish
          turns to Geller, the torch circling towards her, wavering.
          He tries to touch her with the flame, staggers.

                         NOURISH

                         (DYING)
          Death... death to the demoness
          Barb Brecken... to the...

                         PIKUL
          Death to who?
          (he fingers his ID card)
          Oh, yeah... Barb...
          Nourish drops the torch, falls to the ground and snaps into
          the foetal position. A wall of flame roars up around him,
          fueled by the straw, wood, canvas, pod-oils. Pikul jumps
          over to Geller and picks up the trailing cord, twists it in
          his hands until it stops bleeding.
          All four walls of the assembly bay are on fire now. The
          doorway is a flapping sheet of flame. Mixing with the
          swelling rush of the flame are the sounds of the entire
          plant going on alert: yells, screams, sirens, running feet,
          doors being slammed open and closed.
          Pikul holds Geller tightly. She is limp, weak, drained in
          his arms.

                         PIKUL
          I think we just lost the game.
          But now, strange, anomalous objects begin to appear out a
          nowhere in the flames - a chair, a tv set, a bath tub, a
          table, objects emerging into the game from the quest chalet.
          After a moment's confusion, Pikul smiles.

                         PIKUL
          Or maybe not.
          And sure enough, the Trout Farm and its flames and its black
          cloud melt away.

          INT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

          As the guest chalet melts up around them, Pikul finds
          himself back on the bed, as he expected; but he is still
          embracing the swooning Geller, which he had not expected.

                         PIKUL
          Allegra, we're back home. What's
          the matter, what's wrong?
          As Geller swims back up into full consciousness, she begins
          to talk, mumbling at first, then with terrible clarity.

                         GELLER

                         (BARELY COHERENT)
          Pikul. It's here, it's happened.
          It's come back here with us. We
          brought it back with us from
          eXistenZ.

                         PIKUL
          Brought what back? I can't
          understand what you're saying.

                         GELLER

                         (WITH CLARITY)
          We brought the disease back with
          us. My pod is diseased.
          As though realizing the implications of what she's saying
          for the first time, Geller twists away from Pikul and begins
          to fumble with her UmbyJack.

                         GELLER
          Oh God, I'm really going to lose
          it, I'm going to lose my game!
          Unport me! C'mon, unport me!
          Pikul unports her, then begins to tug at his own jack. When
          he takes a close look at the pod, he can see that it looks -
          unhealthy.
          Geller jumps off the bed and yanks open her bag on the
          table. She pulls out a tiny hypodermic syringe, unwraps it,
          flicks the bubbles out of it, falls to her knees beside the
          bed.

                         GELLER

                         (TO POD)
          I'm coming, I'm coming!
          Geller jabs the pod with the needle. As sne pushes in the
          plunger, she starts to massage it with her free hand, rub
          it, prod it. She's so close to it we think she might give it
          mouth-to-mouth.

          But this can't be possible. How
          can a game event emerge into real
          life?

                         GELLER

                         (PANICKING)
          There's a very weird reality-
          bleed-through effect happening
          here. I'm not sure I get it.
          Pikul finally gets his UmbyCord unplugged.

                         PIKUL
          What's in that needle?

                         GELLER
          It's an anti-viral serum. It
          sometimes works if you get it in
          time.
          Unconsciously, Pikul scratches at his bioport. Geller fixes
          on him with strange intensity.

                         GELLER
          Lemme see your bioport.

                         PIKUL
          What?

                         GELLER
          Lemme see it!
          Pikul turns and shows it to her. She begins to examine it
          with microscopic, clinical attention.

                         GELLER
          I know what happened. It's
          Vinokur, that bastard.

                         PIKUL
          Vinokur?

                         GELLER
          He gave you a new bioport, didn't
          he?

                         PIKUL
          Oh, no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          He gave you an infected bioport
          so that my pod would die and so
          would my game-system.

                         PIKUL
          I'm infected? Wait a minute!

                         GELLER

                         (IN TEARS)
          The poor thing was trying to tell
          us that it was sick by
          introducing the theme of disease
          into our game.

                         PIKUL
          The theme of disease? I'm fucking
          reall infected! Is it going to
          crawl up my spine and rot my
          brain?

                         GELLER
          (suddenly all business)
          All right, don't panic. I've got
          something that will help you.
          Brusquely wiping away her tears, Geller goes over to her bag
          and takes out a cork-shaped plastic capsule. She snaps open
          the capsule to reveal a knurled, plug-like electronic
          device.

                         GELLER
          I'm going to seal up your bioport
          with this anti-viral resonator.
          Geller bends over Pikul and works the device into his
          bioport until it's flush with his skin.

                         GELLER
          (inserting the device)
          It uses the Umby pick-ups for
          power. Should cleanse all your
          porting channels of infection in
          a few hours. It'11 give you a
          little skin buzz when it's done.
          Of course, we can't play until
          then.

                         PIKUL
          (controlling his panic)
          Yeah, great. Now, listen. This
          could be critical. Were you

                         (WAILING)
          Oh, God! Pikul, my pod's dying.
          Sure enough, the thing is quivering, rippling, convulsing,
          turning purple.

                         GELLER

                         (WAILING)
          I can't help it! I can't do
          anything for it!
          Geller falls to her knees beside the pod.
          As though triggered by this action, an explosion in the
          nearest chalet blows the windows and the door out of the
          guest chalet. Pikul and Geller are knocked to the floor by
          the impact of the blast.
          Waves of heat and debris billow into the room.
          A moment of eery silence, and then Pikul and Geller peek
          wide-eyed over the-edge of the bed. Flames now engulf the
          nearby chalet, all too clearly visible throught the
          shattered window frames.
          Sounds of pandemonium begin to well up from the hills below,
          and then a figure steps boldly in through the doorway. When
          the flamelight flickers over his face, Pikul and Geller are
          stunned to see that it is the cashier, and he is cradling a
          real-life submachine gun in his arms.
          The cashier screams at the bewildered and terrified pair.

                         (SCREAMS)

          You've got to get out of here.

          The cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet.
          She tries to pick up her pod, but the cashier tugs her away
          from it.

                         CASHIER
          Leave that rotting piece of meat
          here. It's done its job. Let it
          die.

                         GELLER
          But my game! My game's inside it.
          I don't want my game to die.
          The cashier unslings his submachine gun, cocks it, and blows
          the pod into streaks of slime, flesh, and slivers of insect-
          board. Geller is in shock. Pikul turns her to face him,
          speaks' forcefully right into her face, shuts everything else
          out.

                         PIKUL
          Allegra, listen to me. I think
          we're still inside the game. I
          think your real pod's out there
          somewhere, somewhere safe. I
          think it's OK to let go of this
          one, this pod. It's not the real
          one.
          A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters
          against the bed. The bed ignites with an explosive whump.

                         CASHIER
          Everybody out! now!
          The three of them scramble out into the fiery night.

          EXT. CALEDON SKI-CLUB COMPOUND - NIGHT

          The cashier leads Pikul and Geller out of the guest chalet
          and down the mountain path. The chalet next to theirs begins
          to implode as they scurry by it.
          As they flee, they realize that all the chalets are on fire.
          There are people trying to fight the fires, running
          r frantically everywhere with hand-held extinguishers. There
          is also scattered gunfire, but who's firing on whom is
          impossible to tell.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         86

          EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT

          The cashier now leads them up to the top of a hill.

                         CASHIER
          Up here. We can see everything
          from here.

                         PIKUL
          What is it that we're seeing?

                         CASHIER

                         (GLEEFUL)
          The victory of Realism. And you
          were part of it.

                         GELLER

                         (DESOLATE)
          The death of eXistenZ. And we
          were part of it.
          The cashier turns on her with his gun. He snaps out his old
          clip and slams home a new one. He cocks the gun.

                         CASHIER
          There's just one more thing.

                         PIKUL

                         (HORRIFIED)
          What are you doing? We're on your
          side.

                         CASHIER

                         (FIERCE)
          How could you be? How could
          Allegra Geller, the world's
          premiere game designer, be on our
          side?
          (off their bewildered

                         LOOKS)
          Oh, Y93.' We know who you are. You
          can't hide inside a game forever.

                         PIKUL
          Something's slipped over the
          edge, here, Allegra. Something's
          all wrong.

                         CASHIER

                         (SMILES)
          There. You see what I mean. You
          see the problem.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9'
          The cashier raises his gun to fire at Geller, but before he
          can pull the trigger, he jolts backwards and falls twitching
          to the ground.
          From the shadows of the trees, backlit by the fiery
          landscape below, steps Kiri Vinokur. In his hand he holds
          the gristle gun which Pikul assembled in the Chinese
          restaurant.

                         VINOKUR
          I tried to find you. Thank God I
          got here in time.
          (pause; waggles the gun)
          My dog brought me this.

                         GELLER

                         (BACKING AWAY)
          You didn't get here in time. My
          game is dead.

                         (FOCUSSING)
          You murdered my game.

                         VINOKUR

                         (LAUGHS)
          No, just your pod. I replicated
          the entire contents of your pod
          when I fixed your nerve boards.
          They're in safe-keeping. They're
          all in one piece.

                         GELLER
          You copied eXistenZ?

                         VINOKUR
          (soft, pleading)
          Allegra, come over to Cortical
          Systematics. Yes, yes, Cortical
          Systematics. I'm defecting and so
          are all the Antenna Research top
          brass, Pellatt, Melzack, Sherrin,
          everybody good.

                         GELLER
          You're a spy for Cortical
          Systematics.

                         PIKUL

                         (CONFUSED)
          Wait a minute. Cortical
          Systematics is just the qame
          version, it's only...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         I 9

                         VINOKUR

                         TIGNORING PIKUL)
          Not a spy, exactly. I think of
          myself as a personnel exchange
          engineer. If you want to be
          reunited with your creation,
          you'll come over to us. eXistenZ,
          by Allegra Geller. Only from
          Cortical Systematics.

                         GELLER

                         (DEFIANT)
          Only from Antenna Research.

                         VINOKUR
          But why stay with them? Look at
          that mess down there. How could
          you trust Antenna again, when
          they've endangered you like this?
          Geller seems to have lost the thread. She wanders over to
          the cashier's body and disentangles his submachine gun from
          him.

                         GELLER
          (referring to cashier)
          You know, this guy was actually
          going to kill me.
          Vinokur looks to Pikul for support.

                         VINOKUR

                         (TO PIKUL)
          Can you talk to her? I mean, we
          can take you with us too.
          But before Pikul can respond, Geller, now sitting next to
          the cashier's body on the grass, opens fire at Vinokur with
          the submachine gun. Vinokur falls with a startled expression
          on his face.
          Pikul, absolutely horrified, runs at Geller and kicks the
          weapon out of her hand, picks it up himself.

                         PIKUL
          What the fuck are you doing?!
          You've killed him! Are you gonna
          kill me next?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         A-

                         GELLER

                         (LAUGHS GIDDILY)
          C'mon, Pikul. He's only a game
          character. And I didn't like the
          way he was messing with my mind.

                         PIKUL

                         (SUDDENLY CALM)
          Didn't you? You didn't like that
          and so you killed him?

                         GELLER
          He was only a game character.

                         PIKUL

                         (QUIETLY)
          But Allegra. What if we're not in
          the game anymore?

                         GELLER
          (confused, childlike)
          Huh? If... if we... we're not?

                         PIKUL

                         (STRANGELY HARD)
          If we're not, then you just
          killed someone real. A real
          person.

                         (PAUSE)
          You see what can happen. It's
          important for me that you see
          that.

                         GELLER
          Why?

                         PIKUL
          (standing over her)
          It wasn't an accident that you
          and I ended up on the run
          together.

                         GELLER
          Not an accident?
          Pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands.

                         PIKUL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER

                         (COLD)
          That's why you never had a
          bioport. You were one of them.

                         PIKUL
          I still am one of them.

                         GELLER
          But you have a bioport now.

                         (IRONIC)
          I thought that was forbidden to
          Anti-eXistenZialists.

                         PIKUL
          I made the bioport sacrifice to
          get close to you, to make love to
          my enemy.

                         GELLER
          Why would you do that?

                         PIKUL
          To understand what I have to
          kill.

          7.

                         GELLER

                         (QUIETLY)
          Then. understand this.
          Geller produces a tiny electronic remote controller from the
          pocket of her shirt.

                         GELLER
          Understand that I suspected who
          you were from the moment you made
          that fake phone call to yourself
          in the limo. Understand that I
          knew you were my real assassin
          when you pointed the gun at me in
          the Chinese restaurant.
          She flicks up a safety cover on the remote's tip, revealing
          a toggle switch. Pikul's hands tense around the submachine
          gun.

                         GELLER
          And understand that you're dead.
          Geller flips the toggle switch. The base of Pikul's spine
          blows out, his shirt billowing with blood as his bioport
          explodes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9:
          A delighted Geller dances to her feet as Pikul staggers
          backwards.

                         GELLER

                         (GLEEFUL)
          Death to the demon Ted Pikul!
          His eyes frozen in a death stare, Pikul falls, rolls down
          the hill into the underbrush. Smoke creeping up from the
          fires below curls over him like a blanket.
          Arms raised in the air, Geller dances around on the top of
          the hill, looking down on the flames and the chaos.

                         GELLER
          (confident, laughing)
          Have I won the game? Have I won?
          Have I won?
          The hill, the trees, the flames melt down around her.

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

          We melt back up into the church, which we last saw in the
          first scene. But there are many differences between then and
          now,
          Geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before, her
          eyes just beginning to flutter open. But Pikul is sitting
          next to her, also playing the game. And next to him is
          Nourish, whom we are even more surprised to see in this
          context.
          Aad in fact, the players who are sitting in the circle of
          chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the
          movie up to this point: Nader, the cashier, Dichter, Gas,
          Vinkokur, even Frances, the limo driver.
          The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended
          - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir
          in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod-
          technology we have just seen.
          On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with
          electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality
          equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps
          they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules,
          each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which
          I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder
          version of the bioports we have become used to.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are
          two security guards, neither of whom is Pikul, of course. On
          a leash, one of the security guards holds the dog that, in
          the game, picked up the gristle gun in the Chinese
          restaurant.
          Also monitoring the action are a woman, Merle, who is the
          game's actual project manager - the real-life version of the
          game-character Levi - and her two assistants.
          There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the
          players, and now they are free to remove their thumbs from
          the game modules and slide their head-gear off.
          The two assistants - the real-life ones are both matronly
          women - begin to help everyone unplug, neatly gathering up
          the equipment in padded bags as they go.
          A broadly smiling Merle mounts the dais and stands in the
          centre of the ring of players.

                         MERLE
          Are you all back?
          The man whom we knew in the game as Yevgeny Nourish
          immediately stands and takes charge. But it is a different
          Nourish, exuberant, sensitive and artistic.

                         NOURISH
          We're back, Merle. Although I
          have a feeling some of our crew
          might not realize it yet.
          Shaky laughter from some of the players.
          Throughout the following round of comments from the garners,
          whom we now realize have been, up to now, playing characters
          in a game, we hear nothing from Pikul and Geller. These two,
          who sit next to each other and are now holding hands, remain
          enigmatically silent.

                         WAITER
          Wow. Anybody here want a bowl of
          hot and sour soup?

                         (LAUGHTER)

                         VINOKUR
          I will, if you make sure there

                         R
          are some insect boards in the

          How long were we gone?

                         MERLE
          About twenty minutes.

          It seemed like days. That's
          fantastic.

                         FEMALE ASSISTANT
          Yeah. If you stayed in the
          gameworld for most of your life,
          you could live to be five hundred
          years old!

                         (LAUGHTER)

                         CASHIER
          The twists and turns at the end
          made my head spin. Maybe there
          were too many, to fast to absorb.
          (to Pikul and Geller)
          Hey, but you two were fantastic.
          You guys are game divas! I think
          you both deserved to win.
          There is general agreement amongst the garners about this
          compliment to Pikul and Geller. The pair just smile sweetly
          and bob their heads modestly at the smattering of applause.

                         GAS
          (a little jealous)
          Well me, I was really bummed out
          at first. I got knocked out of
          the game so soon. It was fun to
          watch the rest, though. I liked
          that part where the ones who got
          knocked out of the game early got
          to be spooky customers in the
          game store.

                         LEVI
          But you were so wonderfully bad.
          So scary and crazy. I had a lot
          to do in that first scene in the
          church but I thought my character
          was kind of boring.

                         GAS
          Well, you know, I'm a gas-jockey
          in real life, so I was kind of
          disappointed that I was basically
          the same thing in the game. A
          little more fantasy, there,
          fellers.

          Interesting. Interesting. Hold
          that thought for the focus group.

                         FRANCES
          (indicating game module)
          Can I keep this? I've never felt
          anything like it! And I love this
          little thumb-hole. It's
          fantastic!
          (appreciative laughs and

                         APPLAUSE)

                         NOURISH

                         (LAUGHS)
          Nice try, but you're going to
          have to turn them in because
          they're beta versions, pre-
          production hand-made specials,
          and we need to study them after
          use for wear and tear and other
          things. But you'll get a
          certificate for helping us out
          here - I'm right about that,
          aren't I, Merle?

                         MERLE

                         (NODDING ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
          And that will entitle you to
          reserve one of the first batch of
          the TranscendenZ by PilgrImage
          game modules to hit the market,
          and at a seriously discounted
          price. You're gonna love it.
          Amidst applause and general excitement, Merle turns to the
          tripod-mounted chalkboard standing, as in the first scene,
          at the back of the dais. There we see the words that she has
          already written: TranscendenZ by PilgrImage.

                         MERLE
          Remember - it's written like
          this. Capital T, capital Z.
          TranscendenZ. It's new, it's from
          Pilgrimage - capital P. capital
          I, and it's coming soon.

          Allegra Geller now stands up, walks over to Nourish and
          gently takes his hand. He turns to see who's got him, then
          smiles broadly.

                         (SHYLY)
          I'd just like to say thank you to
          Mr. Nourish for giving me the
          chance to play the role of a star
          designer. I guess the game picked
          up on my ambitions to be like
          you.

                         NOURISH
          well, let me first say that I'm
          kinda glad I lost this game. I
          don't usually play such nasty
          characters.

                         (LAUGHTER)
          And, Allegra, you were so good in
          that role that I suspect it won't
          be long before PilgrImage is
          after you to sign a designing
          contract.
          (applause and laughter)
          And maybe you should take your
          friend Ted, here, Mr. Pikul, with
          you. He's obviously good in a
          crisis, and when you design
          games, there are plenty of them.
          Amid the renewed good-natured laughter, Geller blushes. She
          reaches out for Pikul's hand.

                         GELLER
          I guess you all could tell that
          Ted and I had a relationship
          prior to our coming here. We
          really do like to play together.

                         PIKUL
          (shy but determined)
          We do, but I'd like to assure
          everybody here that Allegra
          wouldn't really jump into bed
          with a security guard unless he
          was me.
          (laughs from the security

                         GUARDS)
          Merle holds out her hand in a gesture of appreciation
          towards Nourish.

                         MERLE
          Well, what do we say to our
          brilliant, award-winning game
          designer, Yevgeny Nourish? Does
          he have another winner on his
          hands or not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PC
          Wild applause from all garners, including Geller and Pikul.

                         MERLE
          All right, now, I have to ask you
          some questions, before the game
          half-life wears off. First, let
          me thank you for taking part in
          this test seminar. PilgrImage
          wants to deliver nothing but the
          finest to the game enthusiast,
          and you have all been a proud
          part of that process tonight.
          When we've collected all the
          head-sets and game modules, we'll
          be handing out a questionnaire to
          each of you, and I'd like your
          answers to the questions to be as
          honest, as brutal, as clear as
          you can make them. Don't hold
          back. After that, we're going to
          form a focus group where we'll
          discuss details of each of your
          experiences playing TranscendenZ.
          You've all had different but
          interlocking lives in the game,
          and I think you'll be amazed when
          you hear each other's stories.

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          While the questionnaires are being handed out by the
          assistants, Nourish confers with Merle in a corner.

                         NOURISH

                         (INTENSE)
          Merle, I was very disturbed by
          the game we just played.

                         MERLE
          What do you mean?

                         NOURISH
          It had a very strong, very real
          anti-game theme. I mean, it began
          with the assassination of a game
          designer.

                         MERLE
          or Really? But that's very creative.

                         (PAUSE)
          But on second thought, I see what
          you mean. It makes me nervous.
          You think it must have come from
          one of our game players?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         NOURISH
          It sure didn't come from me. The
          tone of it in the game was very,
          very passionate, fanatical. And
          the atmosphere of paranoia and
          betrayal was overwhelming. The
          whole thing felt unstable,
          dangerous, volatile. But worse
          than that, there was a kind of
          industrial espionage subplot.
          Stealing game-systems, jumping
          ship from one game company to
          another. That kind of thing.
          They both reflexively begin to scan the gaming group, who
          are all innocently dealing with their question cards.

                         MERLE
          So which one of them did these
          elements come from?

                         NOURISH
          Let's probe it when we do the
          focus group. I think we might
          have been infiltrated here, and
          if we have, we've got a big
          security problem.
          Pikul and'Geller, questionnaires in hand, wander over to the
          wary Nourish and Merle. Pikul is now leading the dog that
          the security guard was holding for him earlier on, the model
          for the game dog in the Chinese restaurant.

                         PIKUL
          Hi. We were just wondering if we
          could ask Mr. Nourish a question,
          away from all the others.

                         NOURISH
          Sure. Shoot.

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Long as you don't ask me to fill
          in your questionnaire.

                         PIKUL

                         (NO CHUCKLES)
          We've played your game now, and
          so we can finally agree with the
          others that you are the world's
          greatest game artist.

                         (OMINOUSLY)
          We weren't sure before.

                         SMILE)
          Well, thank you so much.

                         I

                         GELLER

                         (NO SMILE)
          Yevgeny, don't you think you
          should suffer for all the harm
          you've done, and intend to do, to
          the human race?

                         NOURISH

                         (STUNNED)
          What?

                         PIKUL
          Yes. Don't you think the world's
          greatest game artist ought to be
          punished for the most effective
          deforming of reality?

                         MERLE

                         (NERVOUSLY)
          I don't think this is very...
          (looks towards security

                         GUARDS)
          Boys? Could you come over here -
          right now!
          But it's too late. Geller reaches down and pulls a flap of
          false fur and skin away from the dog to reveal two semi-
          automatic pistols strapped to the dog's flank. Pikul and
          Geller grab the guns, pull back the slides, and cooly
          execute Merle and Nourish, who bump grotesquely together as
          they slump to the ground.
          In the stunned silence that follows, only the clatter of the
          last few shells bouncing around on the hardwood floor can be
          heard. Pikul and Geller glance at each other,. pumped, then
          fill the silence.

                         GELLER

                         (SCREAMS)
          Death to the demon Yevgeny
          Nourish!

                         PIKUL =

                         (SCREAMS)
          Death to PilgrImage! Death to
          TranscendenZ!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         33
          Now a hesitant shuffling of feet causes Pikul and Geller to
          whirl and catch the security guards coming at them with
          their pathetic scanning wands. The guards stop in their
          tracks, raise their hands, and start to back away as the
          place suddenly explodes in screams and pandemonium.
          As Pikul and Geller in their turn back towards the front
          exit, they glide past the young Chinese man who was the
          waiter in the game. The waiter stands flattened out in fear
          against a pillar with his questionnaire and his pencil in
          his hand.
          They ignore the waiter, but stop to wait for Pikul's dog to
          trot calmly past them, heading for the door.
          Now Pikul and Geller are just about to turn and follow the
          dog when the waiter unfreezes and takes a step away from the
          pillar towards them. They immediately swing their pistols
          over towards him. The waiter stops and raises his hands.

                         WAITER
          No, wait, you don't have to shoot
          me. I just wanted to ask you a
          question. _

                         GELLER

                         (WARY)
          What?

                         WAITER

                         (INNOCENT)
          Hey, tell me the truth. Are we
          still in the game?
          Pikul and Geller look at each other, then into the camera.
          The church melts down around them into blackness.

                         that bad.  He's just a little...
                             (seeing the statue)
                         Larger than life.

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

               They move past the statue, into the sprawling atrium.

                                   REED
                         He's financed some of the biggest
                         breakthroughs of this century.

                                   BEN
                         You'd never know it.

               He motions to a high-tech ORB, showing FOOTAGE of VDI's
               accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first
               private Space Station.

               All images have VICTOR front and center, glad-handling George
               Bush, Tony Blair, shady International Leaders.  The last
               image is Victor holding the AMERICA'S CUP.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Jesus.  That too?

               They reach three stern RECEPTIONISTS.

                                   REED
                         Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see --

               A receptionist cuts him off, handing them each a pass.

                                   FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                         Executive elevator, top floor.

                                   BEN
                         What's the price for a smile round here?

               They head for the elevator.  Reed carries a small, black box. 
               As they enter the elevator, steel doors shut and we CUT TO --

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - OFFICE - DAY

               A large, dark office.  Ben in the corner.  He yawns,
               watches...

               BRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars.  Planets.  They hover in the air,
               making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         My research suggests that exposure to
                         a high-energy cosmic storm born on
                         solar winds might have triggered the
                         evolution of early planetary life.

               REED stands among the holograms, speaking to a MYSTERIOUS
               FIGURE in shadow behind a desk.  An ominous, PULSATING RED
               CLOUD covers the stars.  It washes over a hologram of EARTH.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         In six weeks another cloud with the
                         same elemental profile will pass
                         Earth's orbit.  A study in space could
                         advance our knowledge about the
                         structure of the human genome, and
                         help cure countless diseases, extend
                         human life --

               The SHADOW clears his throat.  Reed speeds up, emotional.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Give kids the chance to be stronger,
                         healthier, less prone to --

                                   SHADOWED FIGURE
                         Turn it off.  Please.

               The figure's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness.

                                   REED
                         But I haven't fully explained my --

                                   SHADOWED FIGURE
                         Yes you have... Imagination.
                         Creativity.  Passion.  Those were
                         always your trademarks.

               Lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR
               VON DOOM.  35, handsome, commanding.  He looks almost...
               airbrushed.  He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk.  REED is
               on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT
               CUTBACKS.              

                                   VICTOR
                         But dreams don't pay the bills, do
                         they?
                             (a condescending smile)
                         Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. 
                         Still reaching for the stars, with the
                         world on your back.

                                   REED
                         You remember in school we talked about
                         working together.  That's what I was
                         about to explain...

               Reed presses the remote.  Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE
               slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION.  Both bear the
               VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo.  Victor smiles, more intrigued.

                                   VICTOR
                         So it's not my money you want.  It's
                         my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't
                         trust you, why should I?

               Victor is a step ahead.  Reed pauses, thrown for a beat.  Ben
               wakes up, suspicious.  Victor notices.  He notices
               everything.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         That's my job.  To stay a step ahead. 
                         To know what other men don't.

               Ben gets close to Reed, turning toward the door.

                                   BEN
                         I can't take this.

                                   REED
                             (low, quiet)
                         Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
                         
               A beat.  Victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension.  And...

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         He's right, Ben.

               They turn to see...SUE STORM (demure, stunning) standing in a
               corner...possibly for the whole presentation.  A little cold:

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         It's just business.

                                   VICTOR
                         I think you both know my Director of
                         Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

                                   BEN
                         Heya Susie.
                             (under breath, to Reed)
                         One more thing he's got.

               Sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes
               off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug.

                                   SUE
                         Ben, it's been too long.

               She gives Reed a polite handshake.  Victor watches carefully. 
               Reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze.  A little tongue-tied.

                                   REED
                         You're, you've, I mean, how have you
                         bee--

                                   SUE
                         Never better.

               Victor sizes them up.  He puts a hand on Sue's shoulder.

                                   VICTOR
                         This isn't going to be a problem, is
                         it?

                                   REED
                         Not at all.

                                   SUE
                         Ancient history.

               Victor smiles, eyeing Sue.

                                   VICTOR
                         Good.  Then you're just in time to
                         hear the great Reed Richards ask me
                         for help.
                             (to Reed)
                         You know, you made a lot of folks at
                         MIT feel like a junior high science
                         fair.  So you'll excuse me if I savor
                         the moment.

               Ben tightens.  A hard beat.  Reed sucks it up.

                                   REED
                         You back this mission, and I'll sign
                         over a fair percentage of any
                         applications or --

                                   VICTOR
                         The number's seventy-five.  And it's
                         applications and patents.

                                   BEN
                         What about his first born?

                                   REED
                             (quiet)
                         Ben, the money's not important.  We
                         could save lives.

               Sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings.

                                   VICTOR
                         Twenty-five percent of a billion is
                         enough to keep the lights on, isn't
                         it?  Maybe even pay off your fourth
                         mortgage on the Baxter Building.

               They look at Victor.  How does he know all this...?

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Deal...?

               Reed looks at Ben, who shakes his head softly no.  But
               Reed...drops a nod.  Done.  Victor smiles, offers a
               handshake.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Well then, to our future.  Together.

               Victor squeezes.  Hard.  His other hand on Sue's shoulder.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

                                   REED
                         Hilarious.

               As Reed and Sue lock eyes, Ben watches Victor.  Wary.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

               Director of Communications LEONARD enters, checking files.

                                   VICTOR
                         If Reed's right, then this little trip
                         will double our stock offering.

                                   LEONARD
                         And if he's not...?

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed's always right.  Good thing he
                         doesn't always know what he's got...

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

               Reed and Ben step into the elevator.

                                   BEN
                         He knew about NASA.  What if he made
                         the call to shut us down --

                                   REED
                         Ben, think about all the people we can
                         help if this works --

                                   BEN
                         Maybe you should think about yourself
                         for once.  You always let this guy
                         push you round --

                                   REED
                         We got what we wanted.  That's
                         enough.

                                   BEN
                         I know, I know.  I'm just worried
                         about what he wants... Speaking of
                         which...

               Reed follows Ben's eyes to...SUE.  She joins them.  Doors
               shut.

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

                                   SUE
                         You sure about this, Reed?

               He nods, head down.  He doesn't want eye contact.

                                   REED
                         Those solar winds are flaring, but I
                         factored them into my coordinates and --

                                   SUE
                         I was talking about us.  Working
                         together.

               Sue holds her eyes on Reed.  He is clearly uncomfortable in
               her gaze.  Did the elevator just get smaller?

                                   REED
                             (thinking, talking fast)
                         Well, uh, based on our history...you
                         can handle the biogenetics, and I'll
                         focus on the molecular physics.  Or,
                         uhm, maybe I should take the biotech,
                         you work the microscopes, since you
                         have some background in electropho--

                                   SUE
                             (droll, a little annoyed)
                         Right.  That's exactly what I meant.

               She shakes her head -- same old Reed.  He looks at her --
               what did he say wrong?  Ben smiles, patting Reed on the
               shoulder.

                                   BEN
                         Way to not overthink it.
                             (to Sue)
                         So when do we leave?

                                   SUE
                         I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in
                         the morning to talk about resources
                         and crew.

               She offers a business card.  Reed doesn't take it.

                                   REED
                         I, uh, think I remember the number.


                                   SUE
                         It's been changed.

               Beat.  Ben grimaces.  Reed takes the card, his eyes down.

                                   REED
                         As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could
                         pilot the mission --

                                   SUE
                         Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun,
                         but we already have a pilot on our
                         payroll.  You remember my brother
                         Johnny...

               Off Ben's curdling smile, we DISSOLVE TO --

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY

               A helicopter shot through trees.  We soar over timberland,
               and find something massive looming on the horizon:

               A SPACECRAFT.  A sleek take on a space shuttle.  Modern tech
               combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford. 
               The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. 
               WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred
               foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.

               EXT. GANTRY OVERLOOK - DAY

               Ben stares up at the craft.  A sneer on his face.

                                   BEN
                         Can't do it.  I cannot do it.

                                   REED
                         External SRBs, orbital system engines. 
                         Its just like the shuttles you flew
                         in --

                                   BEN
                         No.  I cannot take orders from that
                         underwear model.  That wingnut washed
                         out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria
                         Secret wannabes into a flight 
                         simulator.

                                   REED
                         Youthful high spirits.

               They walk toward the base of the scaffolding.

                                   BEN
                         They crashed it into a wall.  A flight
                         simulator.

                                   REED
                         I'm sure he's matured since then.

               CLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead. 
               PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's
               driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE.  PICK UP
               Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         When have I asked you to do something
                         you absolutely said you could not do?

                                   BEN
                         Five times.

                                   REED
                         I had it at four.

                                   BEN
                         This makes five.

               INT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Reed and Ben unpack gear into lockers.  Suddenly --

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Captain on the bridge!

               Ben goes to attention on reflex: Johnny snaps a picture with
               a digital camera.  Then advances, as Ben realizes who it
               is...

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick:
                         $59.  The look on your hard-ass former
                         CO's grill when he finds out he's your
                         junior officer: priceless.

               Ben eyeballs Johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him. 
               Johnny flinches.  But Ben just reaches for Johnny's zipper,
               adjusts his uniform.

                                   BEN
                         I can handle the ship.  I can even
                         handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I
                         don't know if I should be flying or
                         playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the
                         hell came up with them?

                                   SUE
                         Victor did.

               Sue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying
               a stack of flightsuits.  She hands them out to the guys.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         The synthetics act as a second skin,
                         adapting to your individual needs to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Keep the hot side hot, and the cool
                         side cool!

                                   REED
                         Wow.  Fantastic.

               Reed stares at Sue in the skintight outfit.  She wonders,
               maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out?

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Material made from self-regulating
                         unstable molecules.  I've been working
                         on a formula for this.

                                   SUE
                         Great minds think alike.

                                   VICTOR (O.S.)
                         Guess some think faster than others.

               Victor enters, wearing his custom-tailored flightsuit.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         I hired Armani to design the pattern. 
                         These colors will look great on
                         camera.

               A DOOR OPENS.  Leonard enters, in a sharp suit.

                                   LEONARD
                         They're ready for you, sir.

                                   VICTOR
                         Showtime.

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - HALLS - NIGHT

               Leonard leads Victor through the halls.  Victor checks
               himself in mirrors as he walks, fixing his hair, his uniform.

                                   LEONARD
                         Our numbers are through the roof.  The
                         IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a
                         share.  The bank's five times
                         oversubscribed --

                                   VICTOR
                         It's not just the money.  I could make
                         money in my sleep.

                                   LEONARD
                         Then what is it?

                                   VICTOR
                         History, Leonard.  History. 
                         Everything else is conversation...
                             (a beat)
                         How's the other matter?

               Leonard pulls out a BOX.  Opens it: a TEN KARAT DIAMOND RING.

                                   LEONARD
                         Harry Winston sends his regards.

               They hit a set of big doors.  Victor stops and looks into the
               reflective, metallic surface on the wall.  He fixes one last
               strand of hair.  Perfect. Then he opens the door to... 

               SNAP!SNAP!SNAP!  WHIP-PAN a row of CAMERAS snapping shots of --

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - NIGHT

               Retrofitted into a makeshift press area.  Victor sits on a
               platform, with reporters stretched out below him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Today we stand on the edge of a new
                         frontier.  In the furthest depths of
                         outer space...we will find the secrets
                         to inner space.  The final key to
                         unlocking our genetic code lies in a
                         cosmic storm...

               BEHIND THE ACTION: Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben walk past.  News
               crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture. 
               Our "Fantastic Four" are not exactly big news.  Not yet.

                                   BEN
                         Isn't that your speech?

                                   REED
                         He's made a few changes.

                                   BEN
                         This is your dream, Reed.  You should
                         be the one up there.

                                   REED
                         Victor's better at these things.

               Just past the press area, they see...one woman standing,
               waiting.  This is DEBBIE, Ben's fiancée.  And for the first
               time in the entire film...Ben SMILES.  They hug, kissing. 

               Johnny and Reed watch.  Reed glances at Sue, who walks ahead. 
               Debbie slips a photo into Ben's flightsuit.  A tender beat.

                                   BEN
                         I'll be watching over you.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Just get back soon, or I start looking
                         for a new groom.

               Ben looks at the little ENGAGEMENT RING on her finger.

                                   BEN
                         Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that
                         in for a bigger rock.

                                   DEBBIE
                         I don't care about rocks, I care about
                         you.
                             (to Reed)
                         You bring him back in one piece, or
                         you can forget being Best Man.

               Reed nods, smiles.  Debbie gives Ben a last kiss.  Ben turns
               to Johnny, who gives a cocky smile.

                                   BEN
                         What the hell you smiling at?  Just
                         keep your mouth shut, and your mind on
                         those SMBs --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Actually, the engines are SMEs.
                         Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. 
                         Couple generations past your last
                         ride.
                             (at the threshold)
                         I'm not as dumb as you look.

               Ben just glares at Reed.  This is going to be a long trip. 
               As they follow after Sue, we CUT BACK TO --

               VICTOR ON STAGE

               Mid-speech.  Playing behind him is REED'S HOLOGRAM: stars
               give way to a pulsating red cloud...

                                   VICTOR
                         Think of a world without genetic flaws
                         -- no asthma, allergies, baldness,
                         breast cancer...

               Ben and Reed hear the speech.  Ben bristles.

                                   BEN
                         What's wrong with being bald...?

               Victor smiles at the crowd, commanding.  A true leader.

                                   VICTOR
                         Darwin discovered evolution.  Now we --
                         I -- will define it.  Only in America
                         could...

               The red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the Earth.

                                   VICTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         ...a little country boy from Latveria
                         build one of the biggest companies in
                         the world, and truly reach the stars. 
                         Now if you'll excuse me, history
                         awaits...

               On those words, the HOLOGRAM TRANSFORMS TO...Von Doom's
               SHUTTLE on the launch pad.  BOOM!  THRUSTERS FIRE WHITE HOT. 
               Smoke billows across the pad.  Ready for take off.

               Victor walks past the hologram and exits.  His departure
               perfectly timed with the shuttle LIFTING OFF.

               We push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves
               Earth's atmosphere.  BOOM -- booster rockets fall away and
               the shuttle fires its thrusters.  The hologram transitions
               to...

               A shot of the SPACE STATION high above the Earth.  The
               shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with
               engines afire.  As the shuttle approaches the station we CUT
               TO --

               EXT. DEEP SPACE - SAME

               THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above
               Earth.  THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME

               Victor and Sue lead the others into the command center.

                                   JOHNNY
                             (a "dad voice": to Ben)
                         If you behave, maybe next time
                         daddy'll let you drive.

                                   BEN
                         Keep talking, there won't be a next
                         time.

               Reed is focused on THE EARTH.

                                   SUE
                         Long way from the projection booth at
                         the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?

               Reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would
               bring that up.  It's the first time she's been nice to him so
               far.  He smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with
               Sue.

                                   REED
                         Yes.  Yes it is.

               Johnny and Ben exchange a look.  Reed keeps looking at the
               stars, eyes wide, like a little kid.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               They enter the nerve center of the space station.  Victor
               goes to a computer console on the observation deck below. 
               The windows are closed, so there's nothing to observe.

                                   VICTOR
                             (to ground; via comm-link)
                         Leonard, how's the feed?

                                   LEONARD (V.O.)
                         Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.

               Victor glances at a camera mounted into the console.

                                   SUE
                         We can monitor the cloud's approach
                         and observe the tests from here.

                                   BEN
                         Is it safe?

                                   REED
                         The shields on the station should
                         protect us.

                                   BEN
                         Should?

                                   VICTOR
                         What's wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million
                         dollars worth of equipment not enough
                         for you?

               Ben turns to Victor.  A little tension.  Reed cuts it:

                                   REED
                         Let's start loading those samples. 
                         Get your suit ready, Ben.

               Victor keeps his eyes on Ben.

                                   VICTOR
                         So you still do all the heavy lifting?

               Victor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Maybe you should have stayed back in
                         the lab.  Field work never suited you.

               Reed doesn't defend himself.  Ben steps up.

                                   BEN
                         He does the talking.  I do the
                         walking.  Got it?

               Victor holds tight to his smile.  He nods, condescending.

                                   VICTOR
                         Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm
                         going to borrow Susan for a second.

                                   REED
                         Sure.

               Ben and Johnny read his eyes, as we CUT TO --

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - LATER

               Ben preps for a space walk, putting on a helmet and boots. 
               Johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart,
               each containing a variety of plants.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Please tell me your dawg's not trying
                         to rekindle things with my sister.

                                   BEN
                         'Course not.  Strictly business.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

                                   BEN
                         Hey, two hearts got busted last time. 
                         Maybe she's not over it either.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the
                         year, more coin than God?  Or Reed,
                         the world's dumbest smart guy worth
                         less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's
                         a toss-up.

                                   BEN
                         Put your tiny little mind at ease.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Don't you wander off, boy.

               Johnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door.  He
               looks through a small window to see Ben give the thumbs up. 
               THE AIRLOCK DOOR opens, and Ben gracefully steps into space.

               INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

               Sue descends the stairs at Victor's behest.  Joins him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

                                   SUE
                         I understand the business reasons.

                                   VICTOR
                         Well, when you're looking at your
                         future, it never hurts to find closure
                         about the past.

               Sue's eyes narrow.  What is this about...?

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Susan, every man dreams that he'll
                         meet some woman he can give the world
                         to.

               He presses a button and the observation deck's outer windows
               open up, revealing a spectacular, romantic view of the EARTH.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         In my case, it's not just a metaphor.

               While she stares out the window, Victor reaches into a
               pocket, revealing a RING BOX.  Sue looks unsettled.

               INT. SPACE STATION - NEARBY CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

               Reed checks data on a work station, set on a wall.  The
               results of his calculations are not what he expected... He
               sees WIND VELOCITY digits rise.  He does a double-take when
               he sees the readout: EVENT THRESHOLD, T-MINUS 10:00.

                                   REED
                         No...no...impossible.  It's...too
                         fast.

               INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

               Behind his back, Victor holds the ring box in hand.

                                   VICTOR
                         You've been with me two years now.

               Sue doesn't know where this is going.  She treads lightly.

                                   SUE
                         It's been a good two years, Victor...
                         The company's accomplished so much.

                                   VICTOR
                         Right, of course, the company... But
                         you see, I've come to realize all the
                         accomplishments in the world mean
                         nothing without someone to share them
                         with --

                                   SUE
                         Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done
                         something to make you think...

                                   VICTOR
                         Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of
                         taking big steps.  And this is the
                         biggest step yet.  If it helps, think
                         of this as a promotion.  A merger of
                         sorts...
                             (getting closer)
                         Four little words that can change our
                         lives...

               He is about to spring the ring on her.  She looks like a deer
               in headlights.  She opens her mouth, and...WHAM!  Doors slam
               open.  REED RUSHES INTO THE ROOM.

                                   REED
                         The cloud is accelerating!

               Victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         I don't know what happened.

               Sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify Reed's
               claim.  Starts punching buttons.  Confirms Reed's findings
               with a nod.  Victor hardens, in control.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         We've got minutes until it hits, not
                         hours...Victor, that storm's deadly --
                         the radiation's lethal.  We need to
                         abort.

                                   VICTOR
                         Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all
                         this way to lose our nerve at the
                         first little glitch.  Just close the
                         shields...

                                   REED
                         Ben's still out there --

                                   VICTOR
                         So reel him in.  But we came here to
                         do a job.  So let's do it.  Quickly.

               EXT. SPACE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

               Ben is carefully arranging SAMPLE BOXES OF PLANTS.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Ben, we need you back inside.

               Ben turns to see Reed and Johnny staring from a window.

                                   BEN (INTO RADIO)
                         I ain't done arranging your flowers,
                         egghead.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Ben.  This is serious.  Turn around.

               Ben sees Johnny motioning for Ben to look behind him.  Ben
               turns and sees: THE COSMIC STORM, rumbling toward the
               station.  Not close, but not far.  That gets Ben's attention.

                                   BEN (INTO RADIO)
                         Roger that, on my way.

               He turns back towards the ship.  BEHIND HIM, the storm grows.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME TIME

               Victor rushes into the room, looks at the monitors.  Sees the
               others near the airlock on one screen, and the approaching
               cloud on another.  Anxiety creeps across his face.

                                   AUTOMATED VOICE

               Reed and Johnny stand by the airlock, waiting for Ben.  They
               heard the automated voice.  It panics Reed.

                                   REED
                         Come on, Ben, come on...

                                   VICTOR (ON RADIO)
                         Reed, we're running out of time.

               EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

               A wake of turbulence from the cloud hits Ben, making it
               harder to maneuver.  The cloud's tendrils snake toward him.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               They can see Ben outside the window, still twenty yards away. 
               The entire corridor rumbles.  Lights flicker and spark.  They
               watch helplessly.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               Sue watches the monitor, also helpless.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny... Reed...

               Victor, annoyed by the indecisiveness, marches right up to
               Sue.  Practically shoves her aside as he hits the INTERCOM.

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed, you need to get up here so we
                         can close the shields!  Now!

               Sue glares at Victor.  His lack of compassion shocks her.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Not until Ben is back inside!

                                   VICTOR
                         It's too late for him, and soon it'll
                         be too late for all of us.

               Victor doesn't bother to wait for a response.  He takes over
               the console, punching keys.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing?

                                   VICTOR
                         Raising the shields.

                                   SUE
                         You can't leave them out there.

               Sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster.

                                   VICTOR
                         Watch me.  Reed had his chance.  You
                         can't help them any more than I can.

               Beat.  She takes a step toward the door.  Not sure what to
               do.

                                   SUE
                         I can try.

               With one final glare, she bolts from the room.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               Reed bites his lip.  Thinks.  He decides.

                                   REED
                         Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the
                         command center.  Close the shields.
                         
                                   JOHNNY
                         What about you?

               One look from Reed tells Johnny, he won't leave without Ben. 
               Johnny eyes Ben, steels his courage.  He's not going either.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (to Ben)
                         Come on big guy, you can do it!

               INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Victor watches the shields slide down.  Alone.  An island.

               The exterior air lock door slides open.  In agonizing,
               weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside. 

               The leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a
               hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange
               stains.  Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him.  Ben
               hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether.

                         TEN...

               Johnny punches controls to close the exterior airlock door...

               Reed opens a first aid kit, grabs a thermo-elastic blanket...

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               Clutching the diamond ring, Victor stands defiantly.  Showing
               absolutely no concern for the others.  Interested only in the
               event itself.  Lights and equipment FALL, CRASHING around
               him.

               A control panel EXPLODES in Victor's face.  He jumps back,
               and into the falling equipment.  Collapses under the weight.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - SAME TIME

               Sue rounds a corner, sees Reed and Johnny.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny!  Reed!

                                   AUTOMATED VOICE
                         FIVE...FOOOOUUUR...

               SLOW MOTION: Everyone frozen in position as:

               -- JOHNNY is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel.
               -- REED REACHES out for Ben and the airlock door.
               -- VAPOR STREAM pours down on Sue from a blown gasket.
               -- THE SPACE DUST burns into Ben's skin.

               SLOW MOTION: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door closes, a
               SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben
               in the back, ripping through his suit.  The exterior door
               shuts and seals.  The station loses all power.  DARKNESS.

               EXT. SPACE STATION - DAY

               As quickly as it came, the cloud passes on and whirls away,
               leaving the space station intact.  Power quietly flickers on. 

               Silence.  Time resumes.  All four pick up exactly where they
               left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them.

               INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Victor emerges from the rubble.  He stands, checks his body. 
               A few scrapes, nothing serious.  A thin, throbbing CUT on his
               head.  He touches the wound, but it is not bleeding.

               INT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY

               Reed and Johnny scramble to open the interior air lock door. 
               Sue joins them, as they pull Ben in.  They try to remove his
               helmet.  We don't see his face, but he's clearly unconscious.

                                   REED
                         He's not responsive --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Ben!  Ben!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               A BLACK SCREEN:

                                   JOHNNY'S VOICE
                         Ben, wake up!  Wake up!

               SUBJECTIVE CAMERA, BEN'S POV: The blurry image of Johnny
               comes slowly into focus, standing beside a hospital bed.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Where...where am I?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Back on Earth.  Victor's medical
                         facility... We're in quarantine.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Reed? ... Sue?

                                   JOHNNY
                         They're fine.  Everybody else...is
                         fine.

               Johnny looks away, as if he can't bear to lay eyes on him.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         What's wrong with me?

                                   JOHNNY
                         I swear to you they've done everything
                         humanly possible.  The best plastic
                         surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had
                         the best --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Give me a mirror...

               Johnny picks up a hand mirror on the bed table before Ben can
               reach it, reluctant to give it to him.

                                   JOHNNY
                         They said that's not such a good idea,
                         the shock alone could --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Give me the god damn mirror!

               Ben grabs it from him.  Then slowly raises it to look and see
               that...except for some serious stubble, Ben's totally normal.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Unfortunately, the doctors just
                         couldn't do anything to fix your face!

               He cackles as he heads for the door.  Ben heaves the mirror
               at him, breaking it into hundreds of pieces.  He turns to the
               side-table, and grabs that picture of DEBBIE.  It calms him.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING - DAY

               A modern facility of glass and stone, nestled in the forest. 
               In stark contrast to the lush greenery surrounding it.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/SUE'S ROOM - DAY

               Reed walks down the hall.  His hair is GRAYING at the
               temples.  He passes Johnny, who is smiling, still enjoying
               his joke on Ben.  Johnny slows, looking at Reed's hair.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Nice 'do.  Going for the "grandpa"
                         look?

               Reed passes a mirror, slowing, seeing his gray hairs.  He
               keeps going.  He passes a partially open door.  He stops when
               he catches a glimpse of Sue asleep in bed.  He sees a vase of
               flowers.  He grabs a couple lilies, and enters.

               But Reed sees...the room is already FILLED with expensive
               flowers.  All from VICTOR.  Reed is trumped once again.

               A DOCTOR writes on Sue's chart.  A wall TV plays a press
               conference with Victor, outside the FACILITY.  He looks worse
               for wear.  A few hairs out of place, and a small BANDAGE on
               his face.  We PUSH INTO the press conference --

               Victor pauses.  For the first time.  Just a flicker.

                         And you'll have it.  I've never come

                         then you're all cleared. 

               The Doctor takes his clipboard, and walks out.  Reed steps to
               Sue, with the drooping flowers in his hand.  Quiet:

                                   REED
                         Sue...I want to tell you...I'm...

               WHOOSH.  A NURSE rolls in with a tray bearing ten more
               extravagant bouquets.  Reed looks resigned.  He walks out.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         She's allergic to orchids.  Put that
                         Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed.  The
                         African lilies?  They're her
                         favorites.

               Reed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash. 

               Sue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               A SEXY NURSE wheels a testing station into Johnny's room. 
               He's stripped down to Calvins, changing into a ski outfit.

                         Finish the tests, I know -- could you
                         give me a hand with this zipper?

                                   NURSE
                         You know this is not a ski resort.

                         Not yet.

               Johnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful
               fiberglass object the size of a briefcase.  In the blink of
               an eye, he unfolds it into a LONG SNOWBOARD.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Luckily grandma still sends care
                         packages.

               The nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up.

                                   NURSE
                         You are trouble.

               They both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital
               read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast.

                         That'll give you a minute to freshen
                         up.

               He hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the
               door.  The machine beeps: Johnny's temperature is 209
               DEGREES.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL PATIO - DAY

               Ben finds Reed on a patio with a panoramic view.  Reed works
               at a laptop computer.

                         How long was I out?

                                   BEN
                         Solid.

               Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid.

                         How you doing?

               Reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen.

                         I don't know.  I just keep going over
                         and over the numbers.

               Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen.

                                   BEN
                         It was a freak of nature.  Last I

                         ball.  Let it go.

               Reed considers.  But he can't let it go.  He opens his
               computer back up, returning to work.  Ben shakes his head,
               looks out at the view.  His eyes catch on something, wheels
               turning.

                         Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.

               Reed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE.

                                   REED
                         What?  Come on.  She's got a good
                         thing with Victor --

                                   BEN
                         I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen
                         your screws?

                                   REED
                         He's smart, powerful, successful --

                                   BEN
                         Well maybe you should date him.

               Reed looks at Ben, resigned.

                                   REED
                         Ben.  He'll give her the life she
                         deserves.  She ended up with the right
                         guy.  Things worked out for the best.

               Reed steps away.  Ben stands alone, an idea sparking.

                                   BEN
                         Do I have to do everything myself?

               INT. HELICOPTER/EXT. MOUNTAIN SUMMIT - DAY

               The chopper hovers over this pristine peak.  JOHNNY and his
               NURSE sit in the chopper-bay, prepping their ski gear. 
               Johnny's customized snowboard has wild, acrylic patterns.

               His Nurse wears a hot pink cat-suit, her skis dangling out. 
               Their bodies are close: a sexy, competitive flirtation.  They
               look down at a death-defying black diamond run.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Me like-y.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         Stay right.  Left is trouble.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I though we went over this.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         Last one down springs for room
                         service.

               She pulls down her goggles, jumps out.  Johnny drops out
               after her, hitting the snow.  He smolders: literally.  The
               snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt.

               He takes off after her and the chase is on:

               EXT. BLACK DIAMOND RUN - DAY

               The Nurse knows every inch of the trail, slicing expertly in
               and out of the trees through deep powder.  Johnny's a speed
               freak, maximizing velocity, closing the gap between them. 

               Ghostly FLAMES shoot off his hair: his ski cap catches fire,
               flies off.  Jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket.

               The Nurse looks back: In a burst of speed, Johnny draws even. 
               She looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him...

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         You're on fire!

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not this again --

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         No: You're ON FIRE!

               Johnny sees his gloves are burning, flicks them off in alarm. 
               His body SHUDDERS: the back of his ski suit catches on fire. 
               A burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket.

               Nurse loses concentration, falls.  Johnny races away like a
               missile, screaming in exhilaration.  He looks back -- no
               nurse.

               He tries to put out his flaming clothes, and accidentally
               VEERS to the LEFT.  He fails to notice the giant CHASM in
               front of him.  He faces forward and...

               SCREEAAMMS!  LAUNCHING off the cliff, LEGS FLAILING, trying
               to catch ground.  FLAMES begin to TRAIL his body as he FALLS
               towards the rocks below.  He tries to will his body away. 

               Instead, his body becomes engulfed in flame.  He is a HUMAN
               TORCH!  And for a moment he HOLDS THE AIR -- the fire giving
               him some kind of...LIFT.  He maneuvers just over the rocks,
               almost making a 90 degree turn.

               He looks back at the rocks in disbelief.  But the lift
               doesn't last long. He quickly CRASHES, landing HARD into a
               snowbank.

               He opens his eyes; tries to move but can't.  He's trapped
               under snow and ice.  With all his strength, he tries to move,
               NO DICE.  Panic sets in. His eyes go wide as the snow around
               quickly begins to melt.  Johnny is on fire, and within
               seconds he's sitting in a small POND, steam rising from the
               water.

               The nurse races toward the steam.  Scared, panicked.  She
               finds Johnny...smiling, sitting naked in an impromptu hot
               tub, staring at his hands.  His body.  Exhilarated.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Care to join me?

               She smiles and unzips.  The FLAMES DISSOLVE TO...CANDLES IN --

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               On an expansive parapet with a billion-dollar view, Victor
               prepares a romantic dinner-setting as his staff scurry about. 
               He checks every fork and knife, with a slightly manic energy.

                                   VICTOR
                         How's the IPO?

                                   LEONARD
                         Stable.  We're looking at low
                         twenties.  It's a good number,
                         considering the fallout from --

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed's disaster.  You know, I half-
                         think he did this to me on purpose.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

               But Victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing.

                                   VICTOR
                         Get me on the AM shows, Larry King,
                         cover of the Journal...
                             (staring into silver tray)
                         I've got to do something about this
                         scar.  Make sure they only shoot my
                         right side.

                                   LEONARD
                         Actually, uh, people seem to think the
                         scar "humanizes" you.

                                   VICTOR
                         And that's a good thing?

               Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect.  It
               glistens in the silver tray.  His eyes are bloodshot,
               sleepless.

                                   LEONARD
                         You know, maybe you should get some
                         rest --

                                   VICTOR
                         Later.  First, I've got some
                         unfinished business.  A deal that
                         needs closing...

               Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread.  A beat.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? 
                         You could have any woman in the world
                         but --

                                   VICTOR
                         That's why.  Because I could have
                         any other woman... You know, when
                         they asked Caesar "why England," he
                         said, "because it's not mine."

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - LATE AFTERNOON

               Two dozen EMPLOYEES sit and eat.  Others serve themselves at
               the buffet.  Ben and Sue walking into the dining hall --

                                   SUE
                         I can only stay for one drink, Ben. 
                         I've got to meet with Victor.

                                   BEN
                         Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

               They turn a corner and find Reed, entering by another door.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Hey Reed, what are you doing here?
                             (before he can answer)
                         Great, why don't you join us?

               He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. 
               Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the
                         buffet.

               Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING

               The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  The
               room is darker, more romantic.  Ben finishes the last shrimp
               on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.

                                   BEN
                         Pardon me...

               Sue and Reed stare at him.  Ben's stomach growls again.

                                   REED
                         Are you alright?

                                   BEN
                         I think I need to lie down.  Bad
                         shrimp.

               This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well,
               unsteady when he walks away.  He looks down at his stomach.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Really bad shrimp.

               ANGLE: Fireplace.  Sue looks gorgeous in the light.  A beat. 
               A long beat.  Reed doesn't know where to start with this
               woman.

                                   REED
                         Feeling better?

                                   SUE
                         Yes, thanks.

                                   REED
                         That's good.  That's uh...good.

                                   SUE
                         You always had a way with words.
                             (an awkward beat)
                         I should be getting back.

               Sue gets up to leave.  Exasperated, Reed tries to think of
               something, anything, to say.

                                   REED
                         I'm really happy for you and Victor.

               She slows down, looking at him.  She was hoping for more.

                                   SUE
                         You're happy for me and Victor.

                                   REED
                         I can tell you guys are enjoying what
                         was the best part of our relationship --

                                   SUE
                         Which was?

                                   REED
                         Passion.

               We see surprise on Sue's face, and...

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         For science.

                                   SUE
                             (frustrated)
                         You are such a dork, Reed... You never
                         got it and never will unless it's
                         explained to you in quantum physics.

               As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around
               her BENDS.  The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.

                                   REED
                         What?  What did I say?

               She looks more disappointed than angry.

                                   SUE
                         It's never what you say.  It's what
                         you don't say. What you don't do...

               She lets that hang.  A lot of history here.  Quiet, hurt --
               she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.

                                   REED
                         I...I...I just wanted to --

               As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.

                                   SUE
                         It's been two years, and all you can
                         say is you're happy for me and some
                         other guy...
                             (standing up, hurt)
                         You know, Victor may be a lot of
                         things, but at least he's not afraid
                         to fight for what he wants...
                             (Reed looks down)
                         And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. 
                         To be heard...seen... Reed, look at
                         me.

               He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her
               cheek and her bewitching eyes.  He drops his fork, shocked.

                                   REED
                         Uh, Sue...?  I can't.

                                   SUE
                         What?  What do you mean you --

                                   REED
                         Sue...look at your hands.

               She raises her hands, but we don't see them.  We only see a
               medical waistband...floating.  Her watch...floating.  Her
               clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.

               Sue is invisible.  She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a
               GLASS off the table...

               SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed
               instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two
               feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- 

               Then snaps back into place.  Reed stares at his arm in
               disbelief.  Sue's eyes widen as well.  The rest of Sue
               reappears.  They look at each other: mutual alarm.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         You guys will not believe what just
                         happened!

               They look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for
               the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

               CLUNK.  The candles burn low on the table.  Victor strides
               out, heading for the door.  He runs his hand through his hair
               to comb some strays.  A CLUMP comes off in his fingers.  He
               PAUSES.  He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  His SCAR. 

               It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD).  Victor
               peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. 
               Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING

               DOUBLE DOORS burst open.  Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently
               walk.

                                   SUE
                         It has to be the cloud.  It's
                         fundamentally altered our DNA.

                                   REED
                         Let's not jump to conclusions, we need
                         a massive amount of evidence before
                         making that leap.

               Reed glances over his shoulder.  He stares.  Sue follows his
               gaze to see: Johnny's FINGERTIPS are on fire.  He SNAPS his
               fingers.  They GO OUT.  He's totally unharmed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Now what is up with that?

                                   REED
                             (deadpan)
                         The cloud has fundamentally altered
                         our DNA.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?

                                   SUE
                         Apparently I can disappear.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Please tell me you go silent too. 

               Only one thing on Reed's mind --

                                   REED
                         We have to find Ben.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive
               bursts of flame.  He turns it on and off, like the "CLAPPER."

                                   JOHNNY
                         Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame
                         off --

                                   SUE
                         Johnny.

               He does it again.  Flame on, flame off.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Stop it.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay, "mom."

               Reed's about to knock on Ben's door when he hears the
               banging, moaning and pleading inside.  Johnny smiles.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my
                         nurse!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         Ben, are you there?

               A creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and
               gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the
               contours of Ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough
               and craggy.  SOUND of grinding heavy rocks.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         Open up Ben, we need to talk.

               It all stops.  A beat, then all four legs of the bed give way
               and it crashes to the floor.  Under the covers, he groans in
               pain, and his voice is DEEPER, GRAVELY, but definitely CLEAR:

                                   BEN
                         LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed decides they can't wait any longer.  He kneels to the
               floor.  He concentrates, not sure if it will work...
               Suddenly, his arm STRETCHES, THIN ENOUGH TO CREEP UNDER THE
               DOORJAMB.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed's arm wriggles under the door.  It bends upward, swiping
               clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob.  Rubbery fingers
               find the latch and unlock the door.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed focuses, and pulls.  His arm snakes out from under the
               door and snaps back into place.  His flesh and bones
               reforming before their eyes.  Johnny stares at Reed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Ewwwwwwww.  That is disgusting.

               They hear a tremendous SMASH from inside the room.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               They open the door.  The room is trashed.  Every stick of
               furniture smashed to splinters.

                                   REED
                         ...Ben?

               Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used
               to be.  They rush to it.  Looking out they see SOMETHING
               LARGE in the distance, running away.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What is that thing?

                                   SUE
                         I think that thing is Ben.

               Reed looks out, emotions roiling.  Is that his best
               friend...?  Suddenly, Victor comes around the corner (bandage
               bigger).

                                   VICTOR
                         What's going on?

                                   SUE
                         Victor, are you feeling alright?

               He considers, but never shows weakness.  He nods.

                                   VICTOR
                         Just a little banged up.  A couple
                         scrapes.  Why?

                                   REED
                         Ben did this.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ben did this?

                                   REED
                         He's had some kind of...reaction to
                         exposure from the cloud.  And he's not
                         the only one.

                                   SUE
                         We need to find him.

               Victor redirects his attention to Sue.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Victor, I'm sorry I --

                                   VICTOR
                             (cold)
                         Just find him.

               Victor strides off, leaving the others.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Anybody know where the big guy's
                         going?

               We PUSH IN on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed
               knows exactly where Ben is going.

                                   REED
                         He's going home.

               EXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

               A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance. 
               CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo
               trains.  We PUSH IN on the main track, where...

               A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.  We hear a cargo DOOR slide
               open, then WHUMP!  Big FEET hit the ground.  Someone, or
               someTHING barrels into the night.

               EXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

               A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.  SOUND of breaking
               glass.

               INT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

               SERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.  Jackets rip,
               shoes split.  He needs an extra extra extra large.

               EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.  It's Ben.

               CLOSE ON: The dial pad.  Big fingers try to push keys but
               they're too large.  Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more
               and more frustrated.  He manages to press "0" with his pinky.

                                   BEN
                         Hello, Operator?

               Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a
               modest, working-class home.  His eyes go soft when he sees
               Debbie grab the phone.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Deb... It's me.  I need you to step
                         out front.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Out front?  You home, baby?  I got
                         a surprise for you.

               He blinks hard.  Sad, dark.

                                   BEN
                         I got a surprise for you too.

               EXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT

               Debbie steps out.  There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the
               door.  She looks out.  The wind blows softly.  Something
               shifts in the darkness.  Debbie pulls her robe tighter.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Ben?

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Don't come any closer for a sec.  This
                         is gonna be kind of a shock... You
                         remember when we said "together
                         forever no matter what"?

                                   DEBBIE
                         Baby, you're scaring me.

               A hanging beat.  And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE
               HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he
               once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.

               Debbie sees him.  Fear washes over her, not sure what to
               think.  He reaches out, a little tentative.  She flinches
               back.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to
                         Ben?

                                   BEN
                         Deb, it's me.  It's still me.

               He reaches out.  She recoils.  It's too much for her.  Tears
               swell in her eyes.  Covering her mouth, she backs away.

               He takes a step closer.  She backs away faster, tripping over
               her robe, falling into the street.  A car screeches to a
               halt.  Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries
               back.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!

               Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS.  Lights flicker on.  Ben knows he
               has to go.  He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time
               he'll see her.  She trembles, terrified.  His eyes go moist.

                                   BEN
                         I love you, Deb.

               With that, he turns away.  The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters,
               falls to the ground.  A tragic tableau.  As more lights go on
               around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.

               INT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY

               Victor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: "VDM" emblazoned
               on a gold plate.  Leonard waits not-so-patiently.

                                   VICTOR
                         Make sure you find Ben, bring him back
                         here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't
                         need this to hit the press.

                                   LEONARD
                         Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at
                         eight, then a nine-thirty interview
                         with the Journal --

                                   VICTOR
                         Front page?

                                   LEONARD
                         Top left, like you asked.
                             (a smile)
                         Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who
                         knows...maybe Washington.

               Victor turns to Leonard, disappointed with him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Leonard.  Think bigger.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               We swoop toward this epic monument.  On a steel girder above
               the road, we see...a STATUE.  BEN.  He sits on the edge of
               the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding,
               muttering.

                                   BEN
                         A few days in space, it'll be great,
                         what's the worst that could happen?

               A PIGEON flutters past him, and drops a white gooey gift on
               his shoulder.  Ben just glares up at the heavens.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Perfect.  Thanks.

               He hears the sound of someone SOBBING.  He turns to see...a
               distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase.  The man drops his
               case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.

               The Businessman looks out, ready to jump.  He doesn't see Ben
               (or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You think you got trouble?  Take a
                         good look, pal, how bad could it be?

               The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified.  Ben steps forward.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Okay, easy there, buddy.

               Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY!  His
               arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight
               while his legs thrash over speeding traffic.  Cars and trucks
               SKIM right underfoot.  Ben shakes his head.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You had to choose my spot, didn't you?

               Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam!  The
               Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP!  He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing
               hard on the highway!  A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben.  They point. 

               Ben looks up, deer in headlights.  He sees a massive TRUCK
               bearing down on the Businessman.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         This is really not my day.

               Ben DROPS to the street.  WHOOMPF!  He lands in front of the
               Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and
               turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.

               The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide.  The truck SWERVES,
               but cannot stop!  Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little
               scared.  He shuts his eyes, and...

               SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK!  A football move.  The
               truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to
               the windshield!  It looks like a metal car-compactor.

               The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders. 
               CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A
               FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT!  Windows shatter, fires flicker. 
               One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER.  COPS clamber out.

               EXT. CAB ON HIGHWAY - DAY

               Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back.  They see the action
               on the bridge.  Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the
               destruction.  He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped
               in his cab.  Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.

               He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the
               airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon.  He tries to grab
               the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG.  He struggles.

                                   BEN
                         A little help here?!  You wanna hit
                         that button, sir?

               The driver is too woozy.  Ben can't get to the button. 
               Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE
               DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab!  COPS round the corner. 
               They see Ben holding onto the Driver.  They raise their guns.

                                   COP
                         FREEZE!  PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT
                         DOWN!

               Ben looks at the cops.  PEDESTRIANS stare, point.  He
               realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man
               in hand.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - APPROACH - DAY

               At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops.  The
               whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic.  We PUSH
               TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...

               REED, JOHNNY, SUE.  They look through smoke and mayhem to
               see...their first full look at Ben.  Reed stands gutpunched.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not even Ben deserves that.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it.  He lunges
               behind a truck.  The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them
               back.  Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.

               He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on
               walkways overhead.  He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING
               MOTORISTS.  He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - GRIDLOCK - DAY

               Reed, Sue, and Johnny race toward the flames.  All other
               people head in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  BRIDGE POLICE herd
               the crowd away from the accident.

                                   BRIDGE COP
                         Back!  We're evac-ing the bridge. 

               Reed, Sue, and Johnny slow down, swap glances.

                                   SUE
                         What now?  Reed...?  What do we do?

               MOVE IN ON REED.  A first test of leadership.  But he is not
               a leader.  Not yet.  Sue gets closer to him.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Ben's out there.  Let's go get him.

                                   BRIDGE COP
                         Maybe you didn't hear me.  Those cars
                         are gonna blow sky high, any second.

                                   REED
                         Look, we've got a friend out there in
                         trouble.  We need to get to him before --

                                   BRIDGE COP #2
                         Nobody gets past this point.

               A hard beat.  Reed signals Sue with a look, a nod.

                                   SUE
                         What?

                                   REED
                             (mutters)
                         We need to get past them.

               He motions to her body.  She understands.  She concentrates,
               and starts to turn invisible.

                                   BRIDGE COP #1
                         What the hell is this?  A magic show?

               But her clothes don't go invisible.  Beat.  Reed mutters:

                                   REED
                         Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.

                                   SUE
                         What...?
                             (realizes)
                         Oh.

               She unbuttons her blouse.  Not thrilled with the idea.  She
               wriggles out of her pants.  Down to her skivvies.  She
               reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses
               concentration and becomes visible.  The sight of Sue in her
               undies grabs the COPS' attention.  Everyone watches, stunned. 

               The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of
               bricks.  Cops are transfixed.  So is Reed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         This is wrong in so many ways.

                                   REED
                         You've been working out.

                                   SUE
                         Shut up.

               Sue takes a deep breath.  Closes her eyes.  Focuses.  Nothing
               happens.  She's embarrassed and furious.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you
                         should strip down next, see how it
                         feels to have fifty people staring --

               ...and she DISAPPEARS.  Entirely.  Undies float.  Jaws drop.

                                   REED
                         Uh, Sue?

               She stops ranting.  Realizes she's gone invisible.

                                   SUE (INVISIBLE)
                         Oh.  Well then...

               The undies drop.  The cops stare open-mouthed.  They turn to
               look at Reed, astonished.  He sheepishly shrugs his
               shoulders.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I'm gonna need serious therapy.

               A beat.  She walks away.  The cops watch her, gaping.  By the
               time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone,
               disappearing into the clouds of smoke.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               A news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best
               angle on the action.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY

               Reed races through wreckage.  He tries to see over a big
               TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!

               He finally sees...BEN.  Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO! 
               His face snakes right in front of Ben.  Ben jumps.

                                   BEN
                         What the --!

                                   REED
                         Ben.  Are you okay?

                                   BEN
                         Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?! 

               He motions to Reed's neck.  Then to his own body:

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause
                         I sure ain't Ben anymore.

               Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.  Not yet.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT!

               Ben spins, looking for Sue.  He can't see her.  But he does
               see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!

               BOOOOM!  The first car BLOWS!  BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!  Empty
               cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming! 

               Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms
               FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.

               FLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. 
               Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving
               him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,
               SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks
               the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.

               Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The
               air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.

               She looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields
               SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames
               hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from
               her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her... 

               Sue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE
               FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast
               deflects off the street and into...

               An oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF
               THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail
               slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.

               THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE
               WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck
               TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the
               front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!

               He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across
               the concrete, digging grooves into the street.

               ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward
               the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down
               at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The
               HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!

               Ben SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS! 
               His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. 
               Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic,
               painful.

               He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. 
               His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the
               truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing
               over Ben.

               Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps
               back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary
               cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...

               The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers
               joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised,
               touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable. 

               Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats;
               he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE.  Ben steps
               toward her, but she stops him with a look.  She places
               something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.

               Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground.  He stoops over
               to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING.  His big fingers can't grip
               it.  He tries in vain.  Hopeless, pathetic.  A beat.  And... 

               A hand grabs the ring.  It's Reed.  Quiet, close.

                                   REED
                         I swear to you, I will do everything
                         in my power until there is not a
                         breath left in me: you are going to be
                         Ben again.

               Off the wounded look in Ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Victor sits with remote in hand, staring at his plasma TV. 
               ON THE TV: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new
               Fantastic Four.  For the first time they strike a heroic
               pose.  Leonard enters, with a phone in his hand.

                                   LEONARD
                         Uh, sir...Larry King called, to
                         cancel.
                             (seeing the TV, a beat)
                         Apparently, there's a bigger story.

               Victor sees Reed put his arms around Sue as he covers her
               with the jacket. And the penny drops: he's FURIOUS.  As it
               hits him, he feels something odd.  He looks down at his
               hand...at glints of gleaming METAL poking through flesh.

               EXT./INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - DAY

               An impromptu command center -- a series of police tents,
               surrounded by EMERGENCY VEHICLES, NEWS VANS, FIRETRUCKS.

               INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - TENT - DAY

               Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny sit together, getting changed. 
               They get ready to go, but the CHIEF FIREMAN enters, stopping
               them.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         There's some folks outside, want to
                         talk to you.

                                   REED
                         We're not going public with this. 
                         We're scientists, not celebrities.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         Too late, son.

               He turns on a little TV MONITOR in the corner.  NEWS FOOTAGE
               plays on all stations, with the tagline: FANTASTIC FOUR.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
                         That's what they're calling you.  The
                         Fantastic Four.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Nice.

               Johnny heads for the exit.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny, slow down.  Let's think this
                         through, a second.

               Johnny pauses.  Rubs his chin once.  And...

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay.  Done thinking.

               He runs out.  Sue, Ben, and Reed swap glances, knowing Johnny
               cannot be their spokesman.  They take off after him, out to --

               EXT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - PRESS FIELD - DAY

               CLICKCLICKCLICK!  Fifty cameras flash.  The field is full of
               press.  Our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd.

               Johnny eats up the attention.  Ben turns, self-conscious. 
               Reed notices.  The Chief Fireman turns to them.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         So which one of you's the leader?

               Johnny does not hesitate.

                                   JOHNNY
                         That'd be me.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         No seriously.

               A beat.  Sue and Ben turn to Reed.  The Chief hands him a
               mic.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
                         You're on, son.  They all want a
                         statement.

               All eyes go on Reed.  He looks out, gulps hard.  A long beat.

                                   REED
                         Uh, during our recent mission to the
                         Von Doom space station, we were
                         exposed to as yet-unidentified
                         radioactive energy, most likely some
                         kind of nucleotide compoun--

               Nobody came for a science class.  A crush of questions
               overwhelms Reed:

                                   VARIOUS REPORTERS
                         What happened on the bridge?  Does it
                         hurt to stretch?  Were you really on
                         fire?  Is it true that one of you can
                         fly?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Working on it.  And it's a lot harder --

                                   SUE
                         We don't know much more than you do,
                         at this point.  Which is why we will
                         be going directly to the lab, where we
                         can diagnose our symptoms and --

                                   REPORTER #2
                         Symptoms?  So it's like a disease?

               Reed looks at Ben's face, feeling the guilt.  Ben is lost in
               thought, looking at Deb's ENGAGEMENT RING.  Johnny leaps in.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Symptoms?  Please.  If having powers
                         is a disease, then yeah we got it. 
                         And we are gonna blow your minds. 
                         There's a new day dawning.  The day of
                         the Fantastic Four.

                                   REPORTER #3
                         That thing doesn't look too fantastic.

               The Reporter nods toward Ben.  Ben's fists tighten, the sound
               of rocks crushing together.  Reed feels the pain.

                                   REED
                         Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero
                         who's been through a terrible orde--

                                   JOHNNY
                         What he's trying to say is: every team
                         needs a mascot...

               Reporters laugh.  Ben turns his head away.  Reed burns.

                                   REED
                         Look, we went up to space to find a
                         way to understand DNA, to cure
                         disease, save lives.  Well, now it's
                         our DNA, our disease, our lives on the
                         line...
                             (a beat)
                         Thank you.  No more questions.

               Reed, Sue, and Ben get up to go.  The press waits a beat,
               then surges.  Ben spins, holding up one finger.  A giant.

                                   BEN
                         Be nice.

               The press step back, intimidated.  Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's
               FACE FREEZES.  It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in --

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               Establishing shot of a historic New York building.

               INT. BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               BANKERS sit around a table.  LAPTOPS hum.  The lead banker is
               power-broker NED CECIL.  The men keep their eyes on Victor.

                                   NED CECIL
                         Well, Victor, the bank would like to
                         congratulate you.  On the fastest
                         freefall since the Depression.  We
                         can't even give your stock away.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ned, you know I can turn this around.

               Ned motions to the paper, the picture of BEN.

                                   NED CECIL
                         You promised a cure-all, and came back
                         with this.  Who the hell's going to
                         invest in a biotech company that turns
                         its workers into circus freaks?

               Victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS
               FLICKER, losing feeds.

               Victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do
               that?)  He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal.

                                   VICTOR
                             (pointed)
                         I really appreciate all your support.

                                   NED CECIL
                         You've got a week, Victor.  One week
                         to turn this around.  Or we pull
                         out...
                             (a beat)
                         This meeting is over.

               Victor looks at him, blood boiling, and we CUT HARD TO --

               INT. BANK - HALLWAY - DAY

               Victor and Leonard stride out.  Victor is writhing.

                                   VICTOR
                         Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know
                         preferred stock from livestock.

               Leonard is thinking all business.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir.  Reed's comments at that press
                         conference killed us.  How are we
                         going to turn this around?

               Victor considers.  His mind races, eyes narrow.

                                   VICTOR
                         Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can
                         cure these freaks, then I can cure
                         anyone.  What better way to restore my
                         reputation?

               Leonard nods, impressed.  Victor is a man in motion.  As they
               step into sunlight, we cut to...CLICKCLICKCLICK in --

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

               REPORTERS snap pictures.  A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping
               in front of a towering HIGH-RISE.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny and
               get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON,
               which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle
               position.

               COPS hold back the surging press.  Ben keeps his head down,
               self-conscious.  He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Smile, Ben.  They want to like you. 
                         Give 'em your good side.  Or your less
                         bad side.

               Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS.  Stiff, tentative:

                                   BEN
                         Uh...don't do drugs.

               The kids FLINCH.  Ben trudges on.  Johnny smiles bright,
               doing hand-signs for F4.  Sue pulls him toward --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

               The Fantastic Four enter.  They are greeted by JIMMY
               O'HOOLIHAN, an old-time doorman with a kind smile.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr.
                         Richards.  All that for you?

               He motions to the flashing cameras outside.

                                   REED
                         I'm afraid so...

               He searches for the name.  Sue steps up.

                                   SUE
                         Jimmy.  Good to see you again.

               He smiles at Sue, then at Reed.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Good to see you too... Don't worry,
                         sir.  I know how crowded that head of
                         yours is.

                                   REED
                         Any visitors while I was away?

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Just the usual.  Told 'em you were
                         circling round outer space.

               He opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK.  Reed looks
               sheepish.  He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue.

                                   REED
                         We had a tough year.

                                   BEN
                         Yeah, nine years straight.

               Reed looks at Ben.  Thanks a lot.  DING.  Elevator doors
               open.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               They enter.  Reed hits the top button, for the 20TH FLOOR.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Twenty?  From outside the place looks
                         a lot taller.

                                   REED
                         Oh, it is.

               The doors close, but...the ELEVATOR does not move.  A beat.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Either we're moving really fast...or
                         not at all.

               A digital readout on the panel: EXCEED MAXIMUM WEIGHT.  A
               sign reads: MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 2000 pounds.  They turn to Ben.

                                   BEN
                         I'll take the stairs.

               Doors open.  He lumbers out.  As the doors close behind him,
               he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Reed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               The elevator rises.  Reed roils with guilt.

                                   SUE
                         How come Ben can't turn it on and off
                         like us?

                                   REED
                         That's what we're here to find out.

                                   SUE
                         If it happened to him, then it
                         could...

               Happen to all of them.  Reed nods softly.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Wait.  You mean there's chance we
                         could be full-on-24-7-fantastic? 

                                   SUE
                         Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run
                         around on fire for the rest of your
                         life?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I
                         can't be the only one who thinks
                         this is cool.

               Reed considers.  But Sue cuts him short with a look.

               DING!  The elevator stops.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

               The elevator opens.  They step out.  They might be on the
               20th floor, but Reed owns the building from here to floor
               sixty.  It's a massive atrium, lit by skylights far above -- 

               Reed leads them into another area filled with separate
               "apartments" and all the amenities of home.

                                   REED
                         We should stay here until we can
                         define the extent of our changes...

                                   JOHNNY
                         This place is deluxe.  You got cable?

                                   REED
                             (hearing Ben's FOOTSTEPS)
                         ...and figure out how to reverse them. 
                         Let me show you to your rooms.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

               The press has died down, but there are still plenty of
               cameras.  A MAYBACH SEDAN rolls up.  Victor emerges, wearing
               sunglasses.  This time, the press pay no attention to him. 
               No cameras flash.  Victor tightens, and enters the building.

               INT. SUE'S ROOM - DAY

               Sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair. 
               She notices a familiar book on a shelf: a SCRAPBOOK.

               She flips through it.  It's filled with pictures of Reed and
               his inventions -- a lot less fancy than Victor's multimedia
               globe.  She stops at a picture of her and Reed in COLLEGE.

               A noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to
               see...VICTOR.  He smiles, standing at the door, watching her.

                                   VICTOR
                         God, I've been so worried about you.

               She notices the scar on his head.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, your scar --

                                   VICTOR
                         I told you, I'm fine.  It's you I'm
                         worried about.

                                   SUE
                         I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --

                                   VICTOR
                         Please, no apologies.  I've arranged
                         for your things to be moved to one of
                         my condos.  You'll have round-the
                         clock care.

               He goes for her bag.  But she stops him.  A half beat.

                                   SUE
                         Thank you, that's generous, but I
                         think I should stay here.  With my
                         brother.  Until we get a handle on
                         this.

               Victor is not used to being rebuffed.  He gives a thin smile.

                                   VICTOR
                         Sue.  I think you should let my
                         doctors have a look at you.

               A tense beat.  Standoff.  Made more tense by --

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         Victor!  What are you doing here?

               They turn to see Reed approaching, with files in hand.

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm starting to wonder the same
                         thing... How much do you know about
                         what happened to you?

                                   REED
                         Not much.  We need to run tests to see
                         the extent of the damage.

               Victor pauses.  He looks at Sue, knowing she's here to stay.

                                   VICTOR
                         Well, let me know if there is anything
                         I can do.  We're all in this together
                         now.

               Victor shakes Reed's hand.  His GRIP is so tight that Reed's
               fingers STRETCH.  Victor lets go, and turns to Sue, who puts
               her hand out.  He smiles, and shakes.  He heads off.

               Reed looks at his hand.  Shakes his wrist.  He looks at
               Victor.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALL - DAY

               Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger.  Reed catches
               up.

                                   REED
                         Victor wait... I just wanted to say,
                         I'm sorry the mission didn't go as
                         planned --

               Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed.  Lights flicker.

                                   VICTOR
                         Didn't go as planned?  It was a
                         catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of
                         four people --

                                   REED
                         I ruined?  With all due respect, I
                         told you to abort --

                                   VICTOR
                         Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my
                         name, billions of dollars on the line,
                         and I will not let you make me look
                         like a fool --

                                   REED
                         Victor, if we could understand what
                         happened to us --

                                   VICTOR
                         I don't want to understand it.  This
                         isn't one of your science projects.  I
                         just want to fix it.  Fast!

               Reed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing.  Lights dim.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         There a problem, Vic?

               They turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway. 
               Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body.

                                   VICTOR
                         No problem, Ben.

               He turns back to Reed.  Close, quiet.  Lights flicker.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Just pay your goddamn electric bill,
                         and get to work on a cure.

               Victor steps away, toward the elevator.  He passes Ben, who
               just smiles and waves "goodbye."  Before Victor's finger taps
               the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit
               responded to him).  Reed exhales, shaken.  Victor steps into --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               The doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE.  He SLAMS his
               fist into a STEEL WALL.  The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING.

               Victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC
               SHELL under the skin.  He stares at it in horror.  The dark
               surface pulsates with electric energy.  What is he
               becoming...?

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               Sue works the controls.  Reed approaches Ben with an
               ELECTRODE NEEDLE.  He tries to stick the needle into Ben, but
               it SNAPS.

                                   BEN
                         You got a chisel round here?

                                   REED
                         If we're going to identify the source
                         of the mutation, we need to isolate
                         your recombinant DNA so we can
                         activate positional genomes.

               Ben looks to Sue for translation.

                                   SUE
                         We need to give you a physical, so we
                         know what got zapped.

                                   BEN
                         Well why didn't you say so?  You want
                         me to lift some weights or something?

               Reed shakes his head.  He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE.

                                   REED
                         No, just sit back.  We have a good
                         sense of your strength from the
                         firetruck.  We need to find the source
                         of your strength.

               He turns on the X-ray machine.  The graph shows SOLID ROCK. 
               The rays don't penetrate.  Sue and Reed look confused.

                                   BEN
                         How bad is it?  You know I used to
                         smoke.

               Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too
               short to wrap around Ben's arm.  Reed stands stumped.  He
               looks at his tray full of instruments.  He picks up the
               little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER.  But it looks miniscule compared
               to Ben.

               Reed has an idea.  He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS. 
               He pulls of a real HAMMER.  He approaches Ben.

                                   REED
                         Okay, this might smart a little.

               He taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS!  SLAMMING
               UP!  RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS!  The ultimate kick in the
               crotch.  Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK,
               wincing.

                                   REED (CONT'D)

                         We'll...continue this later.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               From their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe
               Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber.  Flames escape
               through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched!

               Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000
               degrees Kelvin.  They are essentially taking his temperature. 

               INSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look
               at: the chamber walls begin to glow red.  Machines go
               haywire.

               His feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot
               or two.  He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter.

                                   REED
                         Back it down, Johnny!

                                   JOHNNY
                         I can go hotter!

               He won't stop.  Reed pulls a switch on the wall.  FOAM sprays
               out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames.  He stands there,
               covered in thick FOAM.  His body steams.  So does his temper.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         You're really cramping my style here.

                                   SUE
                         You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter,
                         you're approaching supernova --

                         Sweet.

                                   SUE
                         That's the temperature of the sun.

                                   REED
                         Not only could you kill yourself, but
                         you could set fire to Earth's
                         atmosphere and destroy all human life
                         as we know it.

               Reed looks at the control panels.

                         He cooked the equipment.

               Reed and Ben sit in chairs, facing each other.  A beat

               DENTS.  Reed looks down at his clipboard.  A little awkward.

               Reed and Sue, tables turned: Reed observes her through a
               prismatic device measuring light refraction.  He "sees" her
               through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature.  He's
               having a hard time concentrating.  He focuses on his work.

                                   REED
                         It's not "invisibility" per se. 
                         You're bending the light around you
                         with some kind of malleable force
                         field.  That's what you projected on

                         What about you?  You haven't eaten in
                         days.  How come you're never on this
                         side of the microscope?

               He tightens, uncomfortable with being center of attention. 
               She reaches for his arm, like a specimen.  He pulls away, but
               she sees a glimpse of BRUISES on his ARMS.  She slows down.

                         I've had some headaches.  Migraines.

               A beat.  Reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.

                                   REED
                         You should be able to bend light
                         around other objects, even people, if
                         you could control your emotional state
                         better --

                                   SUE
                         Excuse me?

               She is annoyed.  Reed is oblivious.

                                   REED
                         I'm saying, if you had a little more
                         self control, you could locate the
                         trigger.  Can you remember the exact
                         emotions when --

                                   SUE
                         Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.

                                   REED
                         Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate
                         that feeling?  Some memory or...

                                   SUE
                             (staring right at him)
                         I'm sure I can come up with something.

               She looks at Reed, eyes narrow.  She becomes invisible.  As
               she focuses on Reed -- and gets angry -- a small, clear FORCE
               FIELD forms around her body.  The force-field BENDS LIGHT
               around a MICROSCOPE, which goes INVISIBLE.  Reed steps out to
               ask...

                                   REED
                         How's that coming -- whoa --

               The FORCE-FIELD shoots in all directions, knocking everything
               over in a fifteen foot radius.  Reed is thrown from his
               chair.

                                   SUE
                         I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
                         do that... You must think that was
                         some kind of latent hostility or --

                                   REED
                         What in the world would give me that
                         idea?

               An awkward beat.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         I mean, you broke up with me, right?

                                   SUE
                         Are you kidding?

                                   REED
                         No, I distinctly remember: you walked
                         out my door.  Ergo...

               She didn't want to get into this.  She looks down,
               vulnerable.

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  I was ready for the next step,
                         you weren't, ergo, I walked.

                                   REED
                         I think it was a little more
                         complicated than --

                                   SUE
                         I just wanted to share an apartment. 
                         What was so complicated about that?

               The question stumps him.  A beat.  He struggles.

                                   REED
                         There were a lot of variables to
                         consider --

                                   SUE
                         No.  There weren't.  There was you. 
                         And me.  No variables, no math.  It
                         was actually the simplest thing in the
                         world.  But your head got in the way...
                         like it always does.

               Her words penetrate.  He knows she's right.  He looks away.

                                   REED
                         Sue...I just...I thought...

               He struggles for the words.

                                   SUE
                         Same old Reed.  Too much thinking...

               He opens his mouth, but...WHAM!  Doors open.  Johnny enters,
               wearing a CHARRED SHIRT.  He points to the burned scraps of
               his shirt.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay guys, we have a serious problem.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               ANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from
               various closets/containers:

                                   REED (V.O.)
                         Our uniforms were exposed to the storm
                         like us.  So they can transform like
                         us, becoming invisible, changing size
                         on demand or remaining impervious to
                         flame.

               REVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves
               in a mirror wearing the uniforms.  No boots, no gloves.  Not
               yet.  (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes).

                                   BEN
                         You look like an eighties rock band.

                             (to Ben)
                         The suit will stretch.  You should try
                         it --

                                   BEN
                         I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

                                   JOHNNY
                         He's right.  These costumes are...
                         missing something.  I can't put my
                         finger on it --

                                   REED
                         They're not costumes.

                                   SUE
                         We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we
                         need to stay here till we've stabilized.
                        
               Johnny shakes his head, frustrated.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I'm getting sick of being trapped
                         here.  NASA wasn't even this strict!

               He marches out.  Sue turns to Reed, who says nothing.  Sue
               heads out, leaving Ben and Reed.  A beat.  Ben looks at Reed.

                                   BEN
                             (looking at uniform)
                         Maybe it's missing a utility belt. 

               Off Reed's dark look, we hear:

                                   VICTOR (V.O.)
                         So what's the prognosis?

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON: an X-RAY.  Victor's ARM.  The metallic
               transformation is higher now.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor
               and his DOCTOR.  In the wall behind them: ancient armor
               (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not).  It adds a little
               menace to the room.

                                   DOCTOR
                         Your tissue, your organs, your entire
                         biophysical structure is changing. 
                         Every system is still functioning,
                         somehow --

                         And they're changing into...

                         I don't really know.  A compound
                         organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than
                         titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than
                         diamonds --

                                   DOCTOR
                         At this rate, the infection should be
                         complete in two, maybe three weeks --

                         What do you mean "complete"?

                                   DOCTOR
                         I wish I could tell you.  I can't
                         pretend to know what we're dealing
                         with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --

               Victor hardens, razor sharp.

                                   VICTOR
                         What?

                                   DOCTOR
                         The Center for Disease Control.  If
                         this thing is contagious --

               WHHM!  Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look at me.  I have a life.  I'm the
                         face of a billion-dollar-company... We
                         need to keep this confidential,
                         understand?

               Victor's grip TIGHTENS around the man's throat.

                                   DOCTOR
                         But...this disease...is progressive...
                         degenerative...

                                   VICTOR
                         That's terrible news...

               With one cobra-swift move, Victor thrusts his metallic arm
               into the doctor, killing him instantly.  Victor retracts his
               arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               A SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter
               Building, spending hours searching for the cure.  He checks
               charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.

               Finally, he sits at his long desk, looking at a wall where
               Ben's CHARTS are projected (both Ben and Thing's anatomies). 
               Reed wears the uniform under his labcoat.  He checks his
               equations over and over, making notes upon notes.

                                   REED
                         Nothing...nothing...nothing...

               He hits the end of the slides.  The wall fills with white
               light.  Frustrated, Reed SLAMS his head into his desk, CRASH! 
               Something FALLS off the end of the desk.

               Reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face.  He steps
               over to see...a PLANT SAMPLE from space, glass box shattered. 
               Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm --

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Of course...of course...the cloud...

               THE COSMIC STORM swirls, terrifying.  We slowly PULL BACK TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MAIN LAB - NIGHT

               The STORM is a computer-image on screen now.  Behind the
               screen are six chalkboards full of Reed's calculations and
               the scribbled beginnings of a MACHINE.

               We PULL BACK to see his arm stretched across the room writing
               on the end of another chalkboard.

               He's moving fast, excited, almost a little manic.  He
               hears...a CREAK.  He slows down, but doesn't look up to see
               SUE enter.

                                   SUE

                         particles are still charged.  With the
                         right amount of energy, those ions
                         could create the elemental profile of
                         the cosmic storm.

               He rifles through a desk drawer, then heads out.  Sue stands
               there, looking at the storm.  Concerned.  Then we CUT TO --

               slows down, staring at this sprawling space, jam-packed with
               GEAR, GADGETS, BLUEPRINTS, INVENTIONS.  Awe-inspiring,
               overflowing.

                                   SUE
                         You really need to get a janitor.

               She stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         This must be what it looks like inside
                         your head.

               Reed finds his electron microscope.  He turns to Sue,
               defensive:

                                   REED
                         There's a system to it.

               She starts to pull out a MODEL of the FANTASTICAR.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Wait!  Sue, don't touch tha--

               The little car sets the whole shelf off balance.  A WAVE OF
               INVENTIONS COME CLATTERING DOWN!  Reed moves fast:

               He LUNGES toward Sue, STREETCHING his ARMS AROUND the SHELF,
               pushing Sue away, just as the INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND! 

               Reed and Sue hit the floor.  A close call.  Now more
               closeness: Sue and Reed lay face-to-face, with Reed's wrapped
               around her.  A heated beat.  Their first real intimate
               moment.

                                   SUE
                         Sorry.  My fault.  I won't...touch
                         anything.

               As if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, Sue and
               Reed stand, backing off.  As they part, we see:

               BEN watching from the doorway.  Melancholy.  He disappears. 
               We slowly MOVE TO...A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in a VENT GRATE.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches a bank of videoscreens.  He has the Baxter
               Building under surveillance.  He sees Reed and Sue on
               monitors.  He toys with Sue's diamond ring in his gloved
               hand.

               A door opens.  Leonard enters.  He sees the screens.

                                   LEONARD
                         Is Reed any closer to a cure?

               Victor looks at that image of Reed and Sue on the screen.

                                   VICTOR
                         The only thing he's closer to is
                         Sue...

               But Victor sees something between Reed and Sue on the wall. 
               He leans closer, and the camera ZOOMS IN, as if responding to
               his will.  He ZOOMS all the way to a CLOSE UP of:

               REED'S BLUEPRINTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER.  Victor's
               eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Make me a reservation for two at
                         Cipriani tonight.

               Victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old VIDEOTAPE.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         And get this over to Ben Grimm.

               Victor leans forward, fixated on that machine.  As he gets
               closer, his screens go STATICKY.  He absentmindedly picks at
               his SCAR.  In shadows, we see skin peeling off.

                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Close your eyes, baby.  Keep 'em
                         closed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT

               BEN GRIMM stands front and center.  Not the Thing.  But BEN
               GRIMM.  A normal man.  He smiles wide, shaking his head.

                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         You surprised?

               Now we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN.  The
               Thing watches the old videotape.  He smiles sadly at his old
               life.  He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart.

                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)
                         Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the
                         fire department didn't shut this down.

               ON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a
               SURPRISE PARTY.  Full of people.  Ben Grimm is a popular guy. 
               On screen: Reed hugs Ben.  They pose for pictures together.

                                   THE THING
                         God.  I was good looking.

               We hear the party sing "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."  Debbie kisses Ben. 
               Thing's eyes start to mist.  On screen: Ben blows out
               candles.

                                   DEBBIE (ON SCREEN)
                         What did you wish for, honey?

                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)
                         I already got it.  Everything I want.

               As they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek.  The tape ends,
               and he sits in darkness for a beat.  A long, lonely beat.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLS - NIGHT

               Ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat. 
               As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:

               REED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall.  His ARM is
               STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner.  Ben just
               shakes his head, keeps moving.  And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM... 

               UP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL.  The
               muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut.  Finally, we reach... 

               REED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in
               his other hand, measuring distance.  His skin STREEETCHES. 
               His face tightens, pained.  We hear the faint SQUEAK of his
               skin.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Damn, Stretch!

               Reed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall.

                                   JOHNNY
                         How far's that rubber bend?

               Reed keeps moving, slowly.  His muscles and tendons laboring.

                                   REED
                         That's what I'm trying to calculate. 
                         And it's not rubber.  It's muscle,
                         tendon.  I seem to have the ability to
                         manipulate the malleability of my
                         molecular structure and redistribute
                         my density to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Right, whatever, have fun.

               And Johnny is GONE, ducking under Reed's arm into --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP.  It starts
               to POP in his hand, the bag swelling.  He casually turns on a
               TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES.  The Jiffy Pop swells, ready
               to blow.  He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the
               games:

               Cool stunts, hot girls.  Johnny's brow furrows, a thought
               forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT

               A FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora. 
               Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO --

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

               Dark.  Lights flicker.  Steam rises through the grates.  A
               shadow emerges.  Ben.  He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a
               classic Brooklyn tavern.  Neon sign.  Music, life inside. 
               Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes
               through the door into --

               INT. O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT

               A big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a
               place over the bar.  Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT.  He
               moves through the crowd.  People clear out of the way.

               Ben reaches the bar.  He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH!  SMASH! 
               The stool SNAPS like a toothpick.  He hits the ground hard. 
               Glasses shake.  A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly.

                                   BEN
                         That's not funny!

               They go silent.  They drop bills onto tables, filing out,
               scared of this monster.  ERNIE works the bar.

                                   ERNIE
                         Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first
                         mook from Brooklyn to go to outer
                         space, so pay him some respect!

               But the patrons keep filing out.  Ben looks down, weary.

                                   BEN
                         Ernie.  Sorry for killing your
                         business.  I'll take the usual, then
                         I'm out... Better make it a double.

               Ernie heads for the booze.  Ben gives a sad shake of his
               head.  Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the
               bar.  A beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  Meet ALICIA
               MASTERS.

                                   ALICIA
                         Who killed the party?

               She turns to him, unafraid.  He notices her blank stare, lack
               of focus, and white cane.  Alicia is blind.

                                   ERNIE (O.S.)
                         Make it a triple.  On the house,
                         Benny.

               Ben takes his drink, but SMASH!  His grip shatters the glass,
               spilling all over himself.  He smiles ruefully.

                                   BEN
                         If there's a God, she hates me.

               He grabs a bar-rag to dry off.

                                   ALICIA
                         I don't think She's real big on hate.

                                   BEN
                         You wouldn't say that, if you could
                         see me.

               She knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward Ben.

                                   ALICIA
                         Can I...?  See you...?

               Ben doesn't say anything.  A little unnerved by this woman.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         It's okay, I won't bite...
                             (feeling his arm)
                         ...not that I could.

               She puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and
               gentle touch allows Ben to let her.  She smiles softly.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         Such a sad face... You know, sometimes
                         being different isn't a bad thing.

                                   BEN
                         Trust me, this ain't one of those
                         times.

               She smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out.

                                   ALICIA
                         See you round, Benny...

               Right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         I'm Alicia, by the way.

               Ben watches her disappear.  He sees a few people staring.  He
               lowers his head, turns back to the bar, and finds a new
               drink, in a steel MARTINI SHAKER.  He knocks it back.

               EXT./INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Lights twinkle.  A MAITRE D' leads us through fancy digs. 
               Heads turn, whispers flutter.  SUE steps out, joining...
               Victor at a prime table.  He pulls out her chair, wearing
               gloves.

                                   VICTOR
                         Thank you for coming out to see me.

               She nods, a little self-conscious.

                                   SUE
                         You said it was urgent.

                                   VICTOR
                         It is.  There's something we need to
                         talk about.  Something I need to ask
                         you...

               Sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.

                                   SUE
                             (slow, careful)
                         Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I
                         want you to know I appreciate
                         everything you've done for me, but I
                         just don't --

                                   VICTOR
                         Susan.  What are you doing?

               He is cold as ice.  If he's hurt, he'll never show it.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         You think I brought you here to talk
                         about us?  Please.  This is business.
                             (leaning forward, intense)
                         I need to know: how close is Reed
                         to finding to a cure?

               She pauses.  Then:

                                   SUE
                         He's working round the clock.  But the
                         data needs to be tested, analyzed
                         before --

                                   VICTOR
                         Same old Reed.  All analysis, no
                         action.  Wasn't that the problem with
                         you two?

               She holds tight, keeping cool.

                                   SUE
                         If these molecules aren't stable, they
                         could make us worse, maybe even kill
                         us.

                                   VICTOR
                         Then why is Reed dragging his feet? 
                         Maybe he likes having his prize
                         specimen under glass...
                             (closer, cruel)
                         It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally
                         the perfect woman for him...because
                         you're his science project.

               The words sting.  She can't help but hear some truth in them.

                                   SUE
                         Please don't make this personal --

                                   VICTOR
                         Oh, I think you already have.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, we can't do anything until the
                         research is ready.

               Victor's fist CLENCHES -- metal SFX.

                                   VICTOR
                         "We," huh?

               Victor SCREECHES his chair back, PUSHING the table so hard
               that he SPILLS water.  Heads turn, all eyes on Sue.  Victor
               gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Don't forget who you work for, Susan. 
                         So get to work.  And do your job.

               He walks out.  As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out
               of his pocket.  He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the
               dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.

               Sue sits embarrassed.  She slowly...disappears.  People gasp. 
               She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT
               through the air.  At a TABLE FULL OF BUSINESSMEN --

                                   BUSINESSMAN
                         I wish my wife would disappear.

               The other men laugh, but WHHM!  The man's wine SPILLS into
               his LAP!  Sue walks out.  The restaurant is left buzzing. 
               Lights twinkle.  And we FADE OUT.  A beat.  Then we CRASH
               INTO --

               EXT. NYC ARENA - ESPN MOTO X GAMES - DAY

               The X games in full effect: A maze of mountainous dirt hills
               and ramps...where MOTO-BIKES launch into the air to the
               delight of 20,000 fans.  The Riders spin and flip, performing
               aerial acrobatics on their 250CC motor bikes.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have
                         a special guest for you... Johnny
                         Storm of the Fantastic Four!

               JOHNNY emerges, wearing his blue uniform, waving to the
               crowd.  He steps up to the pit where RIDERS prep.  He
               beelines to RONNIE RENNER.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan.

               Ronnie gives a tight nod.  He doesn't like being upstaged by
               this circus freak.

               The other bikers approach.

                                   KENNY BARTRAM
                         Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take
                         her for a spin?

               He motions to his BIKE.  Johnny eyes this mean machine.

                                   RONNIE RENNER
                         Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some
                         tricks...if you can keep up.

               We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO --

               INT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY

               Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny. 
               Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with
               the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart. 
               Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER
                         A rock-solid double-flip!

               The CROWD goes wild.  Now it's Johnny's turn.  He hits the
               hill and pulls the exact same move.  With even more height!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Look at that lift, ladies and
                         gentlemen!

               Johnny sticks the landing.  The crowd swells.  Ronnie
               tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump,
               and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and
                         whipped!

               He lands clean.  The crowd is ready to explode.  Johnny REVS
               his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning. 
               He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A
                         720?

               Johnny lands.  The crowd roars.  Ronnie bears down on the
               last hill.  He leans over his handlebars.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         He's going for a Kiss of Death!

               Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING
               STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And...
               
               JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to
               streak off his back!  He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL! 
               LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS!  SPINNING LIKE A TOP!  A
               FLAMING BLUR!

               And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts
               to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING!  He FLAMES ON, spiraling
               upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                             (hand over mic)
                         Is he......flying?

               A beat.  Time suspended.  And...WHHM!  He PLUMMETS back down! 
               LANDS on his bike in mid-air!  And sticks a perfect landing,
               maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie.  Johnny
               swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face.  What
               the hell just happened??

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         You've just seen the first...the
                         first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH!

               A new name is born.  The crowd goes berserk.  Standing
               ovation.  Riders rush up to Johnny.  Kenny sees his bike:

               THE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF.  Johnny smiles.

                                   JOHNNY
                         My bad.  Sorry about that.
                             (a glance to Ronnie)
                         Thanks for the lesson, bro.

               HOT GIRLS swarm.  As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a
               scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING

               Sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  She focuses
               on one piece of mail that she's holding.  Her hand begins to
               disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as
               well.  Sue smiles at the success.  Intrigued.  Quiet:

                                   SUE
                         That's new...

               Reed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  He keeps his head down,
               preoccupied.  Sue shifts focus.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Have you read these...?  From all
                         over.  People want us to fight crimes... 
                         save their kids...solve their problems...
                             (no response from Reed)
                         ...when we can't even solve our
                         own.

               She puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Reed.  How close are we to a cure?

                                   REED
                         No way to know.  Without more
                         tests, experiments.

               She considers.  Victor's words echo in her head.

                                   SUE
                         We're not specimens, we're patients. 
                         This isn't just another science
                         project to you, is it...?

               Reed looks up, a little surprised.  He opens his mouth, but --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!!

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY

               CRASH!  BANG!  Ben stalks around the room, furious.  Reed and
               Sue rush in.

                                   REED
                         BEN!  What?  What's going on!?

               Ben points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES.

                                   X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         So what can you tell us about the
                         outfit?

               REVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.  He is
               peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit,
               revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a "4" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST.

               Behind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge
               18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air.

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Not too much, but I will say that it's
                         all weather and no leather.  Kind of
                         Armani meets Astronaut.

               Ben, Sue, and Reed stare at the wall-sized TV.  Mouths agape.

                                   SUE
                         He didn't.

                                   BEN
                         Oh, he did.

                                   SUE
                         What did he do to the uniform?!

               She turns to Reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back
               his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.

                                   REED
                         He talked me into it.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         So what are your superhero names?

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies
                         call me Torch.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         What about the rest of the team?

               Johnny hadn't really thought about them.  He spitballs:

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Uh, we call my sister the invisible
                         girl...the Invisible Girl.

                                   SUE
                         Girl...?!

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         That's easy to remember.  And Reed
                         Richards?  He's the leader.  So
                         what's he?  Mr. Fantastic?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader.

               Reed shrugs.  He doesn't hate the name.

                                   BEN
                         Could be worse.

               Case in point: a photo of Ben fills the TV.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         What about this one?  What do you call
                         this Thing?

               Johnny smiles, looking right into camera.

                                   JOHNNY
                         That's it.  Just The Thing.  We would
                         have gone with The Rock, but it was
                         taken.  And "Thing" pretty much sums
                         it up.

               A LAUGH from the studio audience.

                                   BEN
                             (matter-of-fact)
                         Okay.  I'm gonna go kill him now.

               He turns to go.  Reed wraps an arm around Ben.

                                   REED
                         Ben!  Slow down a second and --

               He sees a photo of himself on screen.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         Is it true what they say?  That he can
                         expand any part of his anatomy?

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Actually, between us, I think he's got
                         some problems staying rigid.

                                   REED
                             (finishing his thought to Ben)
                         ...wait for me...

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         Which may explain why this woman's
                         not smiling.

               They put up a shot of Susan.

                                   SUE
                         I'm driving.

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Dude.  That's my sister.

               EXT. NYC ARENA - DAY

               The Thing rounds the corner.  Sees a crowd of girls lined up
               near a red PORSCHE parked out front...with "TORCHED" on the
               plates.  Ben slows down, smiles.

               EXT. NYC ARENA - A LITTLE LATER

               Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in
               the line.  Sue and Reed approach, glare like angry parents. 

               Johnny finds the Valet, who looks ill...his car is gone.

                                   JOHNNY
                             (looking around)
                         Where's my ride?

               The Valet blows his whistle...and a 4 X 4 solid cube of RED
               JUNK METAL slides down the street and stops at the curb in
               front of Johnny.  The Valet timidly holds out the keys...

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         What the?!  Is that my --

               Before he can finish, Johnny gets PELTED IN THE HEAD with the
               license plate.  It rattles to the ground, face up.

               Johnny rubs the sting out of his head.  Looks up and sees Ben
               in the distance, dusting off his hands.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (shouting: to Ben)
                         You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
                             (seeing Sue)
                         What?!

                                   SUE
                         You gave us names?  What are you, the
                         "face" of the Fantastic Four now?

               Ben marches up.  Hands balled into fists.

                                   BEN
                         It's about to be a broken face.

                                   REED
                         This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need
                         to be careful until we're normal
                         again.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What if some of us don't want to be
                         "normal" again?  We didn't all turn
                         into monsters like --

               Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil.  Stops himself. 
               Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.

               Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the
               head.  Ben stops.  Turns around more shocked than hurt.

                                   BEN
                         Did you just --

               Ben gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL.  This time in the face.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!  You want
                         to fly?  Fly.

               Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps
               in the way!  Too late!  WHAMM!  Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO
               REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.  Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's
               fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet. 

               BAM!  Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a
               BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side.  WHOOSH!  He
               leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.

               The crowd stands stunned.  So do Reed and Sue.  Cameras pop. 

               Johnny slowly pulls himself up.  The paint on the truck
               begins to bubble around his hand.  Beaten, bruised, he
               stands.  Heating up.  Both his hands are now flaming fists of
               fury.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's see if we can get blood from a
                         stone.

               He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them. 
               High Noon.  They start to RUN toward each other...

               When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM,
               stops them both in their tracks with just a look.  Like a
               mom:

                                   SUE
                         You two need a time-out.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Blockhead started it!

               Ben just stalks off.  The crowd clears, scared.  A PAPARAZZI
               snaps a picture.  Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens.

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Sue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry.

                                   SUE
                         Damn it, Johnny.

               She goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk.

                                   REED
                         You need to control yourself and think
                         before you --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if
                         we got these gifts for a reason?  What
                         if we have some, you know...like,
                         calling?

                                   REED
                         A higher calling like getting girls
                         and making money?

               Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Is there any higher?

               Reed looks at him, disgusted.  Johnny waves to the crowd,
               hand flaming.  People SHRIEK, snap pictures.  Johnny smiles at
               Reed.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         This is who we are Reed.  Accept it. 
                         Or better yet: enjoy it.

               Johnny steps into the sea of fans.  Reed stands alone.

               EXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY

               Sue wades through the throng of New Yorkers.  Tries to catch
               up with Ben...whose presence parts the crowd like Moses.

                                   SUE
                         Ben!  Slow down...

               Ben glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.  She catches up.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. 
                         He's always been a hothead --

                                   BEN
                         It's not him.  It's them.
                             (pointing to crowd)
                         I can't live like this.

                                   SUE
                         Just give Reed a little more time.
                         You know how he works -- analyzing
                         every little step before he takes
                         one --

                                   BEN
                         It's easy for you to be patient.

                                   SUE
                         No, it's not.  I thought I was done
                         waiting for Reed... We're all in this
                         together now, Ben.

               He slows down, gets closer, intense.

                                   BEN
                         Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got
                         no idea what I'd give...to be
                         invisible.  Your nightmare...is my
                         dream.

               She opens her mouth, but has no response.  She doesn't know
               his depth of pain.  As he disappears into the alley, we CUT
               TO --

               INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               The news plays on the TV.  Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the
               screen on an image of...THE THING.  He turns to Victor, who
               sits with the rest of the bankers.  Cold, sterile
               environment.

                                   NED CECIL
                         This is how you "turn things around"? 
                         These freaks are on the front page and
                         your company's in the obituaries.

               Victor has a larger bandage on his face now.

                                   VICTOR
                         I have a plan to use their publicity
                         for --

                                   NED CECIL
                         Victor, stop.  The bank's lost enough
                         already.  This isn't a negotiation. 
                         It's a notification.  We're pulling
                         out.

               A cold, silent beat.  Victor leans forward.

                                   VICTOR
                         You need to look long-term here. 
                         Without risk, there's no --

                                   NED CECIL
                         Reward.  We all know the sales
                         pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we're
                         done buying... Gentlemen.

               He motions to his men.  They all stand.  Victor is the lone
               man sitting.  PUSH IN on Victor's face, his inner rage
               palpable.  A few quick surges of electricity emanate from his
               body.  This man is getting stronger, more electric.

               INT. BANK - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - DAY

               After hours.  The floor is slick with water -- puddles in
               every direction.  Ned Cecil comes out of the elevator,
               heading for his car.  As he goes, the structure lights start
               to flicker.  Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by
               one, furthest to closest.  He looks around.  Unnerved by the
               darkness.

                                   NED CECIL
                         Hello...?

               A hanging beat.  Victor steps out from shadows.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                             (relieved, almost)
                         Von Doom?  Gave me a little shock.  No
                         hard feelings, right?  Nothing
                         personal.

               Victor says nothing.  Ned keeps going.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                         You know, you could always move back
                         to Latvura, start fresh.

               He mispronounces Latveria, dripping condescension.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                         Maybe that's where you belong, back in
                         the "old country."

               That does it.  A surge of electricity courses through Victor. 
               His eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to
               THE GROUND.  The electric spark hits the water and...

               ELECTRIC CURRENTS RACE ACROSS THE GROUND, SLITHERING
               LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric
               snakes), heading straight for Ned.  His eyes go wide.  And...
              
               NED IS ELECTROCUTED!  His body spasms.  THUD!  He slumps,
               dead.  Smoke rises from his body.  Victor stands, power
               swelling.

               For the first time, his SCAR SPLITS OPEN, revealing a METAL
               GLOW beneath the skin.  He remains scary calm.

                                   VICTOR
                         It's pronounced Latveria.
                             (looking down at the dead body)
                         This meeting's over, Ned.

               Victor walks away, the final lights going to DARKNESS.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Victor enters, still adrenalized.  He turns to the light
               switch, and the lights come on.  He approaches his screens,
               and the monitors flicker to life.  His powers are growing. 

               One MONITOR rolls the news.  IMAGES of the FANTASTIC FOUR. 
               Victor leans closer, and the VOLUME automatically goes up.

                                   NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                         ...the Fantastic Four put on quite a
                         show last night.  They landed in every
                         major headline in the northern
                         hemisphere.  In related news...

               An IMAGE of VICTOR on screen.

                                   NEWSCASTER (ON TV) (CONT'D)
                         Reports have surfaced that Von Doom
                         Industries may be filing for
                         bankruptcy.  You may remember that it
                         was Victor Von Doom who...

               Victor turns away from the screen.  The volume goes down.  He
               focuses his eyes on REED.

               Leonard enters, stepping closer, seeing the faint flicker of
               VICTOR'S METALLIC SCAR.  His eyes narrow, concerned.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, is everything okay?  What
                         happened to your...?

               Victor keeps his eyes on the screen, totally engrossed.

                                   VICTOR
                             (under breath, seething)
                         Reed... He got what he wanted...
                             (looking at Sue)
                         Everything he wanted...he took from me.

               He leans ever closer, so the static starts to swallow Reed. 
               A hard, deadly beat.  Victor's eyes narrow, zooming
               into...REED'S RESEARCH: SLIDES on the wall.  He zooms into
               key words:

               DANGER, UNSTABLE IONS, MUTATION, OVERLOAD.  And Victor gives
               a slow, thin smile.  A new plan forming.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Now I'm going to take it back.  Piece
                         by bloody piece...

               His fist clenches.  We hear METALLIC SFX.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

               Reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal
               man could balance.  But he is not normal.  His arms are
               wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine. 
               He stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees...

               VICTOR overseeing a group of TECHNICIANS.  They are boxing up
               Reed's work -- all of his equipment, research.  Victor wears
               a bandage, covering his scar.  Reed eyes a glint of METAL.

                                   REED
                         Victor, are you...are you okay? 

               Victor turns away.

                                   VICTOR
                         Don't worry about me.  Worry about
                         yourself.

               Reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.

                                   REED
                         What are you doing here?

                                   VICTOR
                         What I should have done a long time
                         ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. 
                         This all belongs to me.

               Reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.

                                   REED
                         But I'm not done with the machine --

                                   VICTOR
                         Which is precisely the point.
                         Analysis is over.  It's time for
                         action.  My men could have mass-
                         produced this by now.

               Reed shakes his head, defending himself.

                                   REED
                         Mass-produced?  This isn't a
                         toaster.  You have no idea how it
                         works.

               Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the
               intricate DIAGRAM of the MACHINE.  He points to parts:

                                   VICTOR
                         Re-create the storm, invert the
                         polarity here, reverse the mutation
                         there.  Don't talk to me like I'm some
                         schoolboy.  I've got the same Phd you
                         do.

               Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with
               his machine.  He points to a SECURE CHAMBER on the blueprint.

                                   REED
                         The storm needs to be handled exactly
                         right, or it could make our mutations
                         worse, much worse, maybe even kill
                         us...

               Victor slows.  Is Reed getting to him?  Or giving him ideas?

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Victor, please.  We need time to
                         verify the data... We can't afford any
                         mistakes -- there's only enough ions
                         for two or three attempts.

               Victor considers.  He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle.

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed.  I'm not asking permission.
                             (a final verdict)
                         We'll build it, while you check the
                         specs.

               Victor walks out.  Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

               The SHIELDS slowly rise.  FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work.  They
               wear the VDI jackets.  Reed watches, worried.

               Sue enters.  She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI
               logo.  And she is deeply worried.  She steps over to Reed. 
               Sparks fly behind them.  Drills scream.

                                   SUE
                         Can I talk to you?

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed.  Quiet, urgent:

                                   SUE
                         Don't let Victor push you into making
                         a mistake --

                                   REED
                         He was going to take away all my data,
                         equipment --

                                   SUE
                         Better than your life.  Victor's not
                         the one who has to get into that
                         thing.  We are.

               Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool.

                                   REED
                         Which is why I'm working twenty hours
                         a day, checking every variable --

                                   SUE
                         Every variable but yourself.  You
                         don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in
                         your head like --

                                   REED
                             (finally losing it)
                         I'm not the only one in there.  I got
                         you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling
                         around in there.

               Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst.  A beat.

                                   SUE
                         So clear it out.  Get out of your
                         head.  Get out of here...

               He looks at her, knowing what she means.  Where she means.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

               Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,
               mind tossing and turning.  People stare, point.  A LITTLE
               GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.

                                   LITTLE GIRL
                         Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My
                         kitty is stuck in a tree.

               She gestures to a tree next to Ben.  Looks up.

                                   LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                         Please save Miss Lucy.

               Ben rolls his eyes.  Looks up.  Considers climbing the tree,
               but thinks better of it.  He has another idea...

               Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap
               out of it.  MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!

               The cat falls into frame.  At the last instant, Ben sticks
               out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  He hands
               the cat to the girl.  Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. 
               He just moves on.

               EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

               Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE
               SCULPTURE of his bust.

               He stops, steps back to take a look.  It's exquisitely
               rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the
               haunting anguish in his eyes.  Ben is amazed, and touched,
               but...

                                   BEN
                             (under breath)
                         Eyebrows are a little big...

               A beat.  He stares at these images of himself.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         I figured the only way to get you here
                         was to stick that in the window.

               He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway.

                                   BEN
                         How'd you know it was me?

                                   ALICIA
                         I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?

               He steps toward her.  But he sees...a PARTY in the back part
               of the gallery.  Ben pauses, a little insecure.

                                   BEN
                         I'm not really dressed for a party.

                                   ALICIA
                         Relax, it's casual.

                                   BEN
                         No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty... 

               She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO --

               INT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT

               WHOOSH!  A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at
               BEN.  Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING
               CHISELS for his cracks.  Intricate, intimate work.

               Ben enjoys every moment.  He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in
               the corner.

                                   BEN
                         Those yours too?

                                   ALICIA
                         My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into
                         stone.  I was wondering when you'd
                         walk by.

                                   THE THING
                         You know, you could'a run an ad in the
                         personals.

                                   ALICIA
                         "Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,
                         rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual
                         relationship."

                                   THE THING
                         This ain't permanent.  My friend
                         Reed's working on a cure...I think.

               She gets closer, running her hands across his arm.

                                   ALICIA
                         Bennie.  You feel pretty good as is.

               Ben bristles.  He doesn't want to stay this way.

                                   THE THING
                         You don't know what it's like out
                         there.  Walking around like some kind
                         of circus freak.  People staring,
                         whispering --

                                   ALICIA
                         I wouldn't know anything about that.

                                   THE THING
                         I mean...

                                   ALICIA
                         Tell me.  When you grew up in
                         Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you
                         know?
                             (a beat)
                         You went your own way then.  You
                         didn't listen to people.  So why start
                         now...?

               As he ponders that, we hear a CROWD SWELLING on the CUT TO --

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Fans swarm JOHNNY.  He signs autographs, poses for pictures. 
               Then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch LIMO.  A
               tinted window rolls down.  Victor's face emerges.

                                   VICTOR
                         Need a ride, Johnny?

               EXT./INT. LIMO - NIGHT

               Johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous MODELS.

                                   VICTOR
                         A few fans.  Hope you don't mind.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Gotta take care of the fans, right? 

               He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look, I built my business knowing what
                         people want.  And right now, the
                         people want you.

               Johnny eyes the models, all lusting.

                                   JOHNNY
                         And we don't want to let the people
                         down now, do we?

                                   VICTOR

                         No we don't.  Which is why we need
                         to strike while the iron's hot. 
                         I'm talking action figures,
                         videogames, sponsors --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Videogames?  You serious?

               Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         You talk to Reed and Sue about this?

                                   VICTOR
                         Johnny.  Let's be honest here.  Ben,
                         Reed, Sue.  Good people, all.  But
                         stars?
                             (shaking his head, a beat)
                         I don't want to break up the band, but
                         you're the one they want.  Don't you
                         think it's time to go solo...?

               Victor subtly nods to the models.  They envelop Johnny.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Take the car for a spin.  Think about
                         it.  Is this the life you want?  Or
                         would you rather live in Reed's
                         lab...?

               The car stops.  Victor gets out.  He stands on the pavement. 
               As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny. 
               The door shuts, and...

               WHHHMMMPF!  The windows all suddenly STEAM UP!

               INT. HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

               STARS on the ceiling.  A VOICE drones about the galaxy.  In
               the LAST ROW, we find: Reed and Sue.  Reed is thinking about
               work.

                                   REED
                         I could get Ben to tap into the
                         Baxter's main power to generate enough
                         voltage --

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look
                         up.

               He slowly looks up.  The stars seem to calm him.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Remember our first date here...?  God,
                         I was so nervous.

                                   REED
                         You were?

                                   SUE
                         Of course I was.  I'd read all your
                         papers on bioethics.  Some of them two
                         times just so I'd have something to
                         say to you.

               Reed smiles softly, thinking back.

                                   REED
                         You know, I bribed the projectionist
                         ten bucks to keep it open late?

                                   SUE
                         I gave him twenty.

               They laugh.  Sue looks up to the stars.  Quiet:

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         I didn't want that night to end.

               Reed looks at her.  Wrestles with a decision.  Then quietly:

                                   REED
                         Sue, you were right.  It wasn't
                         complicated.  I just wasn't ready to
                         be...to become...
                             (a beat)
                         You can be a little intimidating. 

               She knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         You always talked about how you liked
                         the kind of man who could approach
                         you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't
                         afraid to tell you what he wanted.

                                   SUE
                         I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted
                         you to be that man.

               Someone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         When I walked out, I waited ten
                         minutes outside your door.  Ten. 
                         Waiting for you to come find me.

                                   REED
                         Why didn't you say something?

                                   SUE
                         That would have kinda defeated the
                         purpose.  And Reed...
                             (closer, emotional)
                         I'm saying it now.

               Their eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their
               faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue
               disappears.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                             (quiet, playful)
                         Come find me.

               Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...

                                   SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                         That's my nose, genius... These are my
                         lips.

               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft,
               tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

               EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT

               Ben and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns. 
               A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips
               her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal.

                                   ALICIA
                         Look around.  I'll get us drinks. 
                         They always let blind girls cut the
                         line.

               She walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves. 
               The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is
               the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling
               hard.

               Ben steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained
               smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. 
               He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.
               
               Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him,
               thinking he's just an inanimate statue.

                                   PATRON
                         I don't know about this one.  It lacks
                         a certain...realism.

               Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN
               GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
                         She's always had a thing for runaways
                         and strays, but this is ridiculous.

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #2
                         I know.  Did she really think these
                         sculptures would sell?

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
                         Like anybody would want this thing in
                         their house.  That girl's a one-woman
                         charity.

               Ben just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the
               room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He
               glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten
               seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning. 

               We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging
               where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for
               him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his
               heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance. 

               THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --

               EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT

               A pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN
               sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. 
               Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a
               metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then...

                                   VICTOR (O.S.)
                         This seat taken?

               Ben turns to see...VICTOR.

                                   BEN
                         What are you doing here?

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm worried about you.

                                   BEN
                         About me?  How sweet.

                                   VICTOR
                         Come on.  Let me buy you something to
                         eat.  Looks like you could use the
                         company.

               Ben considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat.

               INT. DINER - LATER

               Victor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a
               foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge
               plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other
               customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles
               the plates.

                                   THE THING
                         'Scuse me.

                                   VICTOR
                         I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't
                         changed that much for Reed, Sue and
                         Johnny.  At least they can go out in
                         public.  But for you?  People staring.
                         Whispering behind your back...

                                   THE THING
                         If you're trying to cheer me up you're
                         doing a helluva job --

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm just saying, I know what it's like
                         to lose something you love.  To see it
                         slip away, and know it's never coming
                         back.

               The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.

                                   THE THING
                         Reed's gonna fix me up --

                                   VICTOR
                         For your sake I hope you're right. 
                         I'm sorry if that sounds a little
                         skeptical.

                                   THE THING
                         Skeptical...?

               Ben doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure
               points.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look, he's a brilliant man, we should
                         trust he's working as hard as he can. 
                         You're his best friend.  So what
                         possible reason could he have for
                         taking his time?
                             (a beat)
                         I mean, other than getting close to
                         Sue?

               Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't
               help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close.  Reed
               turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN.  He
               sits waiting, scowling.  They stop laughing immediately.

                                   BEN
                         Yeah, I have that effect on people.

               The construction of the TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER is complete. 
               The Technicians are gone now.

                                   REED
                         Ben --

                                   BEN
                         Oh, you remember my name do you?  You
                         happen to remember what you swore to
                         do with every breath in your body?

                                   REED
                         We're working as hard as we can --

                                   BEN
                         Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.

               He motions to Reed and Sue together.

                                   REED
                         Come on, this is nothing.

               Sue looks a little hurt.

                                   BEN
                         Glad "nothing" could take you away
                         from your work.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I don't know if this thing'll
                         change us back or make us worse. 
                         I need you to be patient for a little
                         while longe--

               He POKES his finger into Reed's chest, which INDENTS around
               it like the Pillsbury Doughboy.  Ben pushes Reed back.  Hard.

                                   BEN
                         Look at me, Reed.  Look at me!

               He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin.  He
               THROWS Reed back.  Reed slams down to the ground.

                                   REED
                         I am looking.  That's why I can't make
                         a mistake!  I've got to get it right,
                         and it's not right yet!  We need to
                         test this.

               Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed.

                                   BEN
                         I spent my whole life protecting you,
                         from the schoolyard to the stars.  For
                         what?  So you could play Twister with
                         your girlfriend while I'm the freak of
                         the week?

               Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back.  Reed slams
               into the wall, and stays down this time.

                                   SUE
                         Ben!  Stop it!  Or I'll stop it.

               She starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields.

                                   BEN
                         Stay out of this Susie.

               As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to WRAP Ben
               up like a python.  They struggle.  Ben runs back into a wall
               to shake Reed.  Their faces are close, heated.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Good thing you're flexible enough to
                         watch your own back.  'Cause you're on
                         your own now.

               Ben seems to relax and Reed lets go.  Ben walks out.  Sue
               comes to Reed's side.  He's bleeding.

                                   REED
                         I'm OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop
                         him.

               She heads out.  Reed slowly stands.  He looks at the
               transformation machine.  It's not ready.  But...Reed steps
               toward it.  As he walks, his image goes grainy in --

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every
               step.  This is what Victor has been waiting for.  His screens
               flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull
               back.  He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE.  Hits a countdown. 
               And he grabs his UNIFORM...

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sue hustles down the long hall.  Ben turns a corner, passing
               the elevators, heading toward a FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She gets
               there too late.  Doors close, going down.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               Ben pounds across the lobby.  He sees Johnny coming in.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Christmas come early!  Check it out!

               He holds up an ACTION FIGURE of BEN: a horribly bloated body
               topped by a tiny pinhead.  Johnny pushes a button and --

                                   BEN ACTION FIGURE
                         IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!

               WITH ONE ARM, Ben shoves Johnny into a wall.  With his other
               hand, Ben grabs the toy and SMASHES it into the wall, inches
               from Johnny's head.  The toy lodges into the plaster.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey!  That's a prototype!

                                   BEN
                         Go back to the drawing board.

               He strides away.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               DING.  Sue speeds out of the elevator.  No sign of Ben.  She
               runs into...JOHNNY who shakes off the encounter.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny?  Did you see Ben?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm
                         done with this freak show.  I'm moving
                         back to the real world.

                                   SUE
                         Is that what you call it?  "Real"?

                                   JOHNNY
                         At least it beats living in a lab like
                         somebody's science project.

               This hits home.  Sue is quiet.  Johnny turns to go.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny, slow down.  Think.  You know
                         mom didn't raise us to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Look around, sis!  She's not here.  So
                         you can stop talking to me like I'm
                         your little boy --

                                   SUE
                         As soon as you stop acting like one. 
                         Come on, you're smarter than this. 
                         You think those people out there care
                         about you?  You're just a fad to them.

               He pulls away from her, taking a step out the door.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's try something new: you live
                         your life.  And I'll live mine.
                             (beat)
                         And just for the record: they LOVE
                         me.

               He strides into the night, leaving Sue alone.  A dark night. 
               The Fantastic Four is no more.  The family is split apart.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               The transformation chamber is up and running.  Numbers count
               down.  The storm swirls in the chamber.  Reed now wears the
               UNIFORM.  He opens the door:

               HE'S GOING TO USE IT ON HIMSELF.  HE IS FINALLY TAKING
               ACTION.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor sits enthralled.  He leans forward, breathless.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Reed gets closer.  His heart races.  So does Victor's.  A
               moment of truth for both of them.  REED STEPS INTO THE
               MACHINE.

               Reed looks up at the cosmic storm.  He opens his arms, ready
               to risk his life.  And...WHHHM!  He JOLTS in JUMP-CUT-MOTION,
               RECONFIGURING, JERKING out of control, and we CUT TO --

               VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               His screens GO BLACK.  He looks out the window to see...a
               flash atop the BAXTER BUILDING.  The tip of the Baxter glows. 
               The rest of its lights GO OUT, FLICKERING in a power surge.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               Lights go haywire.  Sue knows immediately...

                                   SUE
                         Oh god, Reed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Lights flicker in darkness.  The door rips open.  Sue lunges
               inside.  She sees through smoke and sparks...REED sways in
               the chamber.  A beat.  Did it work?  Then...

               Reed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND.  His eyes flutter back.  Dead...? 
               His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard,
               while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted.

                                   SUE
                         What did you do, Reed?  What did you
                         do?

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches every second on his monitors.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Sue struggles to lift Reed -- half of his body is STRETCHED
               OUT, devoid of any semblance of bone structure.  One side of
               his face looks like it's MELTING OFF.

                                   REED
                         I can...make it work.

                                   SUE
                         Reed, stop, you need to rest your --

                                   REED
                         The power...I need...more power...to
                         control...the storm --

                                   SUE
                         You need a doctor.

               Reed loses consciousness.  Sue carries him out.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches, his eyes narrow, looking at his hands.

                                   VICTOR
                         More power...?

               He reaches out for his phone, and...his SPEAKERPHONE
               AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON.  His powers growing.

                                   VICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D)
                         Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat.

               EXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Ben sits alone, looking at city lights.  A man without a
               home.  Without a family.  A hard beat.  HEADLIGHTS slash
               across Ben.  He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a
               LIMO.

                                   LEONARD
                         Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter
                         building.  It's...Reed.

               Ben considers.  Despite it all, he's a good friend.  And a
               good man.  As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC
               IN --

               INT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

               LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS.  A young crowd dances and
               grinds to the beat.  Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF
               FLAME swirl around the ceiling.  We follow them to:

               A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. 
               He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get
               a look at his various parlour tricks.

               He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN.  Closer.  Candles around
               them start to melt.  Beads of sweat drip down her face.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What do you say we get out of here? 

               She pauses.  And...a very LARGE MAN steps up.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         This your boyfriend?

               The Boyfriend doesn't look too happy.

                                   BOYFRIEND
                         Is that all you do?  Bar tricks and
                         stealing chicks...

               Johnny does one more trick...taps the guy's drink...igniting
               it into a burst of flame.  The Boyfriend drops the glass,
               which SMASHES on the ground...catches the floor on fire.

               The boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out.

                                   GIRLFRIEND
                         What are you doing?!  You could have
                         burned somebody!

               The boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk
               off.  She turns back for one last comment...

                                   GIRLFRIEND (CONT'D)
                         You know, if I had your power I'd be
                         doing something with it, not wasting
                         my time doing cheap bar tricks,
                         hitting on some other guy's girl.

               Johnny looks a little embarrassed.  The couple leaves. 
               Johnny glances around.  His FANS look down, away.  He sees
               how quickly they can turn.  The crowd parts slightly.  He
               looks very alone.

               INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Leonard leads The Thing inside.  The ominous chamber sits
               with its door open.  Victor enters from the control station.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ben, come in.

                                   BEN
                         What is this?  Where's Reed?

                                   VICTOR
                         Where do you think?  With Sue.

               Ben looks at the flickering lights.  Suspicious.  Victor
               turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark
               room.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                             (quiet)
                         I'll take it from here, Leonard.

               Leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here.

                                   LEONARD
                         Yes sir.

               Leonard disappears fast, as Victor turns back to Ben.

                                   BEN
                         What do you want, Vic?

                                   VICTOR
                         To help you.  I've run every test
                         known to man.  And they all yield the
                         same result: the machine is ready.

               Ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but...

                                   BEN
                         Reed said it'd be weeks till --

                                   VICTOR
                         He also said we'd avoid that storm in
                         space.  And we know how that turned
                         out.

               Ben nods.  Reed was wrong before.  Ben gets closer to the
               machine, drawn to it.  He wants to believe, so badly.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         He couldn't generate enough power for
                         the machine to reach critical mass. 
                         Yet another mistake for "Mr.
                         Fantastic."

                                   BEN
                         And you can?  Power it up?

               Victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little SPARK
               around him.  The lights...?  Or his skin...?

                                   VICTOR
                         Yes.  I've found a new energy source.

               He keeps his arm behind his back -- his fingertips course
               with ELECTRICITY.  It starts to build, sparking up his arm.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm
                         again?

               Ben keeps his eyes on the machine.  His dream is alive.

                                   BEN
                         Let's do it.

               INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The chamber doors open.  Thing enters.  He looks around this
               sterile box.  An animal in a cage.  Victor pushes a control;
               the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal.  Thing shuts
               his eyes.  He just wants to be Ben again.

               FROM THE CONTROLS: Victor initiates the transformation
               sequence.  As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in
               the lab.  Energy pumps into the chamber.  The storm swirls
               faster.  Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --

               -- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both
               hands...and WHHHM!  A countdown begins in the control panels. 

               SLOW MOVE IN on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window. 
               The chamber activates.  The storm strikes hard.

               The Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony. 
               Struggling violently inside.  To escape?  Extend the moment:
               Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes.

               EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT

               The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie
               glow.  Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of
               the Baxter Building.  The rest of the city lights dim
               slightly.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Reed lies in bed, weak, recuperating.  When the power surges,
               we MOVE in on him: he looks up in alarm, knowing that
               someone's using the chamber.  He starts to get out of bed,
               straining to stand with every muscle left in his body.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM - SAME TIME

               Sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications.  The lights
               dim.  Power failure.  She looks up...

               EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

               Johnny walks alone.  A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky. 
               He looks up.  His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes
               where it's coming from.  He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               INSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris,
               crackling with light.  The chamber rattles dangerously, as
               the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building. 

               And then it's over.  The light dies down...somewhat.  It
               still pulses along with the chamber.  The chamber door SLIDES
               OPEN.

               Beat.  And...BEN GRIMM steps out.  Not The Thing.  No more
               rocks.  BEN GRIMM.  Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN. 

               He slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large.  He
               collapses.  He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.

                                   BEN
                         Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK
                         YOU...VIC?!

               Ben sees a SPARK in shadows.  That spark is...

               VICTOR'S ARM.  Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to
               Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY.  His skin is part
               flesh, part metal.  Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.

               HE IS DOOM.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Vic... What the...?

                                   DOOM
                         Everyone thought I was safe behind
                         those shields...

                                   BEN
                         Victor, the machine worked for me.  It
                         can work for you --

                                   DOOM
                         It did, Ben.  It worked perfectly. 

               Ben starts to realize...

                                   BEN
                         You planned this...?

               Doom smiles, reaches out his hand -- ELECTRICITY builds from
               his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.

                                   DOOM
                         I've always wanted power.  Now I've
                         got an unlimited supply...

                                   BEN
                         And no Thing to stand in your way. 

               DOOM smiles, nods, stronger than Ben now.

                                   DOOM
                         Take a good look, Ben.  This is what a
                         man looks like who embraces his
                         destiny.

               Doom clenches his fist and BLASTS Ben, sending him flying
               backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         One down, three to go.

               Suddenly, WHOOSH!  The lab door flies open.  Reed enters. 
               Doom steps back into the shadows.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Right on cue.

               Reed's eyes go wide.  He sees Ben crumpled in the corner.

                                   REED
                         Oh god Ben.  Are you okay?
                             (amazed)
                         You did it, you really did it...

                                   DOOM
                         No, Reed.  I did.

               Reed slowly turns to see...DOOM.  His body, his face.

                                   REED
                         Victor...?  What, what happened to
                         you?  What did you do to your --

                                   DOOM
                         Exactly what I said I would: I built a
                         better, stronger being.  And
                         outsmarted the great Reed Richards --

                                   REED
                         Victor, this isn't the way to --

                                   DOOM
                             (a dark smile)
                         You always know best.  So tell me. 
                         What happens when you superheat
                         rubber?

               Doom BLASTS an electrical BOLT at Reed, KNOCKING Reed through
               the huge window!  Reed's body RUBBER-BANDS from the blast.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

               Reed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               Doom looks out the window, smiling at his old friend's fall.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - FRONT LOBBY - NIGHT

               DING!  The elevator opens.  Doom strides out.  He passes our
               friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Mr. Von Doom?  Are you oka--

               Doom casually SWIPES, sending him through revolving doors.

                                   DOOM
                         Never better, Jimmy.  And it's Doctor
                         Doom now.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

               Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali
               watch.  He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't
               get a grip.  His ARM streeetches, and SNAP!  He falls like a
               SLINKY, out of control.  Half his body loose, half hard.

               He drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out.  He catches
               Reed's face, holds it close.

                                   DOOM
                         Why the long face?

               Doom whips Reed into the night.  As Doom turns, people cower,
               horrified by his face.  They clear out, and...

               Doom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic
               veins.  A monster.  Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with
               an iron fist, and bounds into the night.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

               Smoke billows, windows are shattered.  Sue races inside,
               seeing Doom's devastation.  Silence, deadly silence. 
               Then...she sees a pile of WRECKAGE shift.  BEN crawls out.

                                   SUE
                         Ben?!

               She helps him out of the rubble.  He is beaten, battered.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Sue!

               Johnny comes running in.  He sees the wreckage.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --

                                   SUE
                         No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.

               He nods.  A beat between them.  He looks around, sees Ben.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Jesus, Ben!
                             (eyeing him)
                         I go away, look what happens.  You got
                         a lot of explaining to do.

               He motions to the wreckage.

                                   BEN
                             (struggling, weak)
                         The machine works.  And Vic's gone
                         Mister Hyde on us --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Really?  With a name like Von Doom? 
                         Never saw that one coming.

               Sue looks around.  Only one question.  Dead serious:

                                   SUE
                         Where is Reed?

                                   BEN
                         Victor must've taken him.

               INT. VON DOOM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to
               the opening scene.  Those mysterious CRATES loom in shadows. 
               He wears a green HOOD, and METAL MASK over his scarred face. 

               Doom's eyes turn toward...the other end of the table.

                                   DOOM
                         Chemistry 101, Part Two.  What
                         happens to rubber when it's super-
                         cooled?

               We now see what he sees: Reed sits in a chair with TUBES
               INJECTED into his skin FREEZING HIM SOLID!  Ultra-cold vapor
               coats him.  Doom steps closer, a sadistic smile.

               Reed tries to move but can't even ball his hand into a fist.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Allow me.

               He PRESSES DOWN on one of Reed's fingers, which makes a
               horrific CRACKING SOUND.  Reed's face twists with pain.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Painful...?

               Doom seems to enjoy every CRACK.  He leans closer.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         You don't know the meaning of the
                         word.

               Doom lets up on Reed and reaches into a crate, and pulls out
               a military-issue ROCKET-LAUNCHER.  He aims at the city
               skyline, locking onto his target: JOHNNY STORM.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         But you will.

               Johnny's HEAT SIGNATURE glows.  The screen flashes: TARGET
               ACQUIRED.  Doom looks back at Reed, his launcher aimed
               casually over his shoulder.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Flame off.

               BOOOOM!  He fires without looking!  A MISSILE blasts into the
               sky.  THE MISSILE LIGHTS UP THE DARK NIGHT beginning its wide
               turn towards its target.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING

               Johnny, Ben, and Sue hear the missile being fired and turn to
               the window -- it BANKS, coming STRAIGHT for them.  They move
               to --

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING BALCONY - NIGHT

               Johnny rushes toward the edge, to get a good look at the
               missile streaking closer.  As he moves, the missile SHIFTS
               slightly with HIS MOTION!  His eyes narrow, thinking.

               He FLAMES ON a HAND.  He waves his flaming hand, and the
               MISSILE locks onto the fire!  Johnny darkens, realizing...

                                   JOHNNY
                         Great.  Heat-seeker.

               His mind races.  He makes a decision, and steps up onto the
               ledge, hundreds of feet above the street.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Sis.  Let me take care of you for
                         once.

                                   SUE
                         But Johnny...you can't fly.

               Johnny considers, a half-beat.  He looks out.  Under breath:

                                   JOHNNY
                         Well then this'll be one hell of a
                         basejump.

               Sue reaches out to stop him, but Johnny DIVES HEROICALLY OFF
               THE EDGE!  He FLAMES ON!  The missile follows his arc.  As he
               drops, his clothes BURN OFF, revealing his UNIFORM.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (under breath)
                         Come on...come on...come on...

               He falls lower, lower.  And...he...BANKS!  SWOOPS UP! 
               FLYING!

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         FLAME ON.

               Sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.

                                   BEN
                         We need to help Reed --

               Sue shakes her head, sympathetic.

                                   SUE
                         Ben, you got what we all wanted. 
                         You need to stay here.  It's too
                         dangerous.

               She heads off.  Ben watches her go, helpless.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               Ben steps back into this ravaged room.  Through the shattered
               window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away.  A hard beat.

                                   BEN
                         What...what have I done?

               EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT

               Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and
               turn, gaining on him, bearing down.  Cars slow, stop.  More
               people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight.

               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Eerily silent.  Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He
               hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom
               even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer. 
               And...

               A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being
               manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next
               to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm.

                                   SUE
                         What has he done to you?

               Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness.

                                   DOOM (O.S.)
                         How romantic.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, please --

                                   DOOM
                         It's Doctor Doom to you.

               He steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin.

                                   SUE
                         We know the machine works.  It worked
                         on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can
                         turn you back --

                                   DOOM
                         Do you really think fate turned us
                         into gods so we could refuse these
                         gifts?

               She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.

                                   SUE
                         Victor.  You always thought you were
                         god.

               Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.

                                   DOOM
                         Sue please, let's not fight.

                                   SUE
                         No, Victor... Let's.

               She HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him
               back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. 
               Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity.

                                   DOOM
                         Susan...... You're fired.

               BOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. 
               She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING
               to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her
               strength to...GO INVISIBLE.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Marco...

               A hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Polo.

               He SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to
               the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible.

               In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and
               out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through
               the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...?

               EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

               Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet
               behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots:

               A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast,
               Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. 
               VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly.

               He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes
               in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit -- 

               JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles
               through the air, we CUT BACK TO --

               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               From their vantage point, they see the missile explode. 
               Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck.

               Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes
               every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes
               a CRACCCKKKKING sound.

                                   DOOM
                         One more down.  Now it's just the
                         scientist and his specimen.

               Sue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He
               has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips
               and get the words out.

                                   REED
                         Sue.  The only thing I ever knew
                         without thinking was...
                             (his lips fully freezing)
                         I...love...

               He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue
               whispers to him:

                                   SUE
                         Me too, Reed.

               Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow.

                                   DOOM
                             (quiet, cruel)
                         And so four became none.  It's my time
                         now.

               BOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH!

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Actually, Vic...

               Reed recognizes the voice.  So do we.  Doom turns to see... 

               BEN GRIMM, AKA THE THING.  Back in rocky, fighting form.

                                   BEN
                         IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!

               Doom turns, just as --

               BAM!  Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever
               been hit.  The force sends Doom back through the air, toward
               the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive "V"
               sculpture.  It SNAPS, crashing onto him.  A few sparks.  Then
               nothing.

               Nothing at all.  No more movement.  Doom is dead.

               Ben turns to Reed.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Damn, I've been wanting to do that.

               Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting
               the tubes from Reed.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                             (Reed's words)
                         Victor's "not that bad," huh?  Just "a
                         little larger than life"?  Maybe
                         you'll listen to me next time before --

               WHMM!  The WRECKAGE shifts.  They turn to see...Doom EMERGES. 
               He stands, power coursing.  And he CHARGES at Ben!  Ben
               charges back.  And these two behemoths...

               SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!!

               EXT. VON DOOM BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

               Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air.  On the ground,
               PEOPLE scream and duck for cover.  Doom and Ben SMASH through
               the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street.

               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS

               BOOOOM!  Doom and Ben, locked in combat, drop through the
               glass, landing in a large HOTEL POOL.  People scream, run.

               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

               UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD.  Their combined weight
               CRACKS the floor of the pool.  A YOUNG BOY watches underwater
               through his MASK.  Doom and Ben square off, but...

               The CRACKS OPEN WIDER!  And they're PULLED toward the HOLE! 
               WHOOSH!  The water is all sucked out of the hole.  The boy
               holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to --

               INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               A HOTEL GUEST sees water FLOOD into the hall.  Roaring rapids
               head straight for him.  He jams his key into the lock,
               turning desperately, just barely leaping out of the way as
               the wave carrying BEN and DOOM SMASHES through a window to --

               EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

               SMASH!  Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the
               TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO --

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

               CRASH!  Water floods the street.  Doom and Ben land in a
               large GARBAGE TRUCK.  The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING
               from the inside.  Grunts, growls.

               CRASH!  The truck suddenly STOPS.  COP CARS SPEED CLOSER,
               sirens screaming.  And --

               BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck.  SMASH!  Ben
               lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks
               the WINDSHIELD.  Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water
               flooding the street around him.  COP CARS converge on Doom. 

               Doom turns his attention to the cops.  His limbs SPARK with
               electricity, ready to fire at the cars.

               EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

               Ben sees the cops and Doom.  He knows the cops are dead meat. 
               He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.

                                   BEN
                         Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your
                         car?

               She nods and quickly gets out, shaking.

                                   OLD LADY
                         The clutch sticks a little.

                                   BEN
                         Not gonna be a problem.

               Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom.  WHMM!  It FLIES
               through the air, and WHAM!  Hits hard, knocking Doom back
               twenty feet!  As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and --

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

               BOOM!  Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS!  CRASH! 
               Windows shatter.  The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE,
               snapping the pole.  Doom steps out, unharmed.

               Ben CHARGES toward him.  Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY
               POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a
               giant STUN-GUN!  Electric sparks FLY through the air into -- 

               BEN!  The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet!  He goes
               FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --

               WHOOMPF!  Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street! 
               Water rushes into the crater.  Ben lays there, incapacitated.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME

               On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP.  Doom
               strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the
               death-blow.  Currents surge.  Right before he swings down --

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         I can't let you do that.

               Simple, strong.  Doom turns to see...REED.  Alone.  Bruised
               and battered.  Slowly stepping toward him.  Doom smiles.

                                   DOOM
                         And you can't stop me.

               He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING
               DOWN!  Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air.

               Something invisible.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Hello Susan.

               She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD. 
               Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It
               skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet.

               Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         What is this?  The pitiful three?

               Doom steps toward them, but --

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Four.

               WHOOOSH!  Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a
               flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.

               Johnny takes his place alongside the others.  The four of
               them stand as one.  Johnny turns to Thing.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Had a little relapse, huh?

               Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Welcome back.

               They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed
               and melted, making him look all the more menacing.

                                   DOOM
                         This is going to be fun.

               Electricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at
               the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a
               thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!

               He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He
               holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in
               buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up. 

               He LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of
               control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires
               SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move:

               Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables. 

               Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges
               surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --

               Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid-
               flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize
               fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field
               and --

               SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar
               starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! 
               They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But -- 

               Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is
               holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas
               holding the world.  People run out, safe.

               ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.

                                   REED
                         JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD!

               Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the
               wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE. 

               Doom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The
               impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed.

                                   SUE
                         Can't...hold...on...

               Doom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands,
               vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! 

               He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he
               forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.

               Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body,
               RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without
               breaking.  He strains, agonizing.

                                   REED
                         Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.

                                   JOHNNY
                         But all these people...

                                   REED
                         Now.

               Johnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting
               build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything.
               Johnny GRABS DOOM.

                                   THING
                             (quiet, smiling)
                         Flame on, kid.

               FLASH!  Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,
               which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.  Reed
               doesn't miss a beat.  He's in total command now.

                                   REED
                         Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,
                         frustration --

                                   SUE
                             (looking at Doom)
                         I'm sure I can come up with something.

               She concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and
               the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.

               Sue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER
               BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which
               WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field). 

               Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them.
               Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it
               in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the
               point that it's blinding.  People look away.

               Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the
               ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her
               knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As
               everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And --

               DOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body
               GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look
               devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed.

                                   DOOM
                         Is that the best you can do...?  A
                         little heat...?

               Reed stays perfectly calm.  He shakes his head.

                                   REED
                         Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101:
                         what happens when you supercool hot
                         metal...?
                             (to Ben)
                         Ben...

                                   BEN
                         Got it, teach.

               He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT.  The water GEYSERS UP!  Ben
               kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays
               toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...

               The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and
               SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!

                                   DOOM
                         No.

               Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING
               DOOM.  GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling
               metal.  DOOM screams.  His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE. 

               The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely
               obscuring Doom from view.  A beat.  The steam clears to
               reveal:

               DOOM.  A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of
               METAL.  Frozen forever.  Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The
               Fantastic Four -- exhale.  They stand as one, in roiling
               smoke.  A beat.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Damn, I love this job.

               Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.

                                   BEN
                         Job, huh...?

               Will they accept their mantle?  Reed shrugs.

                                   REED
                         Well, we do have the suits...

               They give weary smiles.  A team.  Sue gets close to Reed.

                                   SUE
                         You know, about what we said up there,
                         I think maybe --

               THHM!  He KISSES HER.  His neck extending.  Strong, powerful. 
               He pulls back slightly, smiles at her.  A new strength in
               him.

                                   BEN
                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

               Sue looks at Reed.  A long way from that conference room.

                                   SUE
                         Hilarious.

               As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding.  The sun
               rises around them.  The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn
               of a new day.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

               INT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - BANQUET ROOM - DUSK

               Reed and Sue kiss on the deck of the Circle Line as it chugs
               around New York City.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Dude, that's still my sister.

               A PARTY IN PROGRESS.  Drinks, food, music.  We see in the
               crowd a familiar faces: O'HOOLIHAN (cast on his arm),
               bartender ERNIE, others.  JOHNNY and BEN stand behind Reed
               and Sue.

               Reed and Sue pull apart.  Reed turns to Ben, excited.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I've been crunching the numbers
                         on the machine.  I think if we can
                         rework the power settings...

                                   BEN
                         Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.

                                   ALICIA (O.S.)
                         That's my Benny.

               She hands Ben a big METAL MUG.  Ben takes the mug.  He
               CLINKS, but SHATTERS her glass.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         We're going to have to work on your
                         touch.

                                   BEN
                         I like the sound of that.

               Alicia gets close.  A soft smile.  Reed turns to Sue.

                                   REED
                         Sue, can I talk to you for a second?

               Reed leads her out.  Ben and Johnny swap a glance.

               EXT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - DECK - DUSK

               A romantic view of the city-scape.  Reed stands with Sue.

                                   REED
                         I found a broken gasket, from space --

                                   SUE
                         A gasket?  Reed, we're at a party.

               He opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just
               about the size of......a RING.  Sue slows down.

                                   REED
                         If one of us were to wear it...

               She sees Johnny and Ben inside, watching -- in on a secret. 

               Reed looks her square in the eye.  Unflinching.

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  What are you doing?

               Reed drops to his knees.  His head stays eye-level, while his
               body drops.  Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.

                                   REED
                         No more thinking, no more variables...
                         Sue Storm...will you...
                             (she's gone)
                         Sue?  Sue?  You there?

               Dead silence.  And then...

               THE RING DISAPPEARS.  SUE IS WEARING IT.

                                   SUE (V.O.)
                         Yes.

               Reed goes to kiss her.

                                   SUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         That's my nose, genius... These are my
                         lips.

               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.

               INSIDE: the party applauds.  Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move
               through the crowd to join Reed and Sue.  As they go --

                                   BEN
                         No more cracks about how I look.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.
                             (weaving around bodies)
                         Clear the way, wide load coming
                         through.

               Ben glares, fists clenched.  Johnny smiles, mischievous, as
               they hit the balcony.  And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the
               air, blazing the NUMBER "FOUR" enclosed in a circle of flame
               (their future callsign), over the city skyline.  The crowd
               oohs and aahs.  Ben watches, unimpressed.

                                   BEN
                         Showoff.

               People drink, laugh, dance.  We slowly PULL BACK from the
               party, the boat, the city, and...CUT TO --

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               CLOSE ON: the MELTED FACE of DOOM.  He is placed in a wooden
               crate.  LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his
               cell.

               As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of
               ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body.  Leonard's CELLPHONE goes
               STATICKY.  His eyes narrow.  Could it be...?  And --

               SLAM.  The door closes.  We can read the destination through
               stenciled lettering: LATVERIA.  And we pull back to reveal
               the box is on the deck of:

               A FREIGHTER SHIP.  The ship pulls away, steaming into the
               horizon, as we...

                                                       FADE OUT.



                                         THE END
FANTASTIC MR. FOX

          EXT. WOODS. DAY

          An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome
          fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans
          against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing
          on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.
          He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that
          descends into the valley below.
          A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a
          paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears
          men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:

                         FOX
          What'd the doctor say?

          MRS. FOX
          Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-
          four hour bug. He gave me some pills.

                         FOX

                         (REASSURINGLY)
          I told you. You probably just ate some
          bad gristle.
          Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They
          walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the
          path. Fox points:

                         FOX
          Should we take the short cut or the
          scenic route?

          MRS. FOX
          Let's take the short cut.

                         FOX
          But the scenic route is so much prettier.

          MRS. FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK, let's take the scenic route.

                         FOX
          Great. It's actually slightly quicker,
          anyway.
          Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a
          quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her
          waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off
          down the scenic route.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          EXT. FARM. DAY

          A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and
          a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A
          sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from
          the bushes outside a fence.

          MRS. FOX
          What is a squab?

                         FOX
          You know what a squab is. It's like a
          pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of
          bird we can eat.
          Fox motions toward the edge of the property.

                         FOX
          Should we go through the hole under the
          horse fence or climb the rail over the
          bridle path?

          MRS. FOX
          Well, I guess the horse fence would be a
          little safer.

                         FOX
          But the bridle path puts us out right
          next to the squab shack.
          Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods
          nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.

                         FOX
          What's wrong? I've never seen you like
          this. You're acting all skittish. Don't
          worry. I've been stealing birds for a
          living since before I could trot.

          MRS. FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK, let's take the --

                         FOX
          No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me
          the scenic route already.
          Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:

                         FOX
          By the way, you look unbelievably
          beautiful tonight. You're practically
          glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She
          stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her
          cheek.
          (NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this
          shot which can be literally lit from within.)
          With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and
          Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race
          along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window
          where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing
          hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond
          children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever
          sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and
          shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,
          bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely
          pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden
          shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
          rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.
          Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his
          finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs
          impatiently. They duck inside.
          They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in
          his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above
          them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his
          mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:

                         FOX
          What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!
          Look at this.

          MRS. FOX
          Get away from there.

                         FOX
          Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...
          (pointing to different spots)
          I guess if you come from over there, and
          you're standing at the door to the squab
          shack, this little gadget probably
          triggers the --
          (gesturing to Mrs. Fox)
          Move out of the way, darling. That's
          right where it's going to land.
          Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.

          MRS. FOX
          Come on! Stop it! Let's go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly
          from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of
          them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox
          and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.

                         FOX
          No, it just falls straight down right
          here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-
          loaded.
          Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,
          voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says

                         QUIETLY:

          MRS. FOX
          I'm pregnant.
          Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.

                         FOX
          Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,
          that's great news!

          MRS. FOX
          If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I
          want you to find another line of work.
          Pause. Fox nods.

                         CUT TO:
          A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,
          green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a
          river running through the middle.

                         TITLE:
          2 YEARS LATER ( 12 Fox-Years)

          EXT. HOLE. DAY

          The entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with
          holly bushes.

          INT. HOLE. DAY

          A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two
          bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a
          newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the
          temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin-
          striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at
          the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          She is dressed in a paint-splattered, cream-colored,
          Victorian-style dress.

                         INSERT:
          A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of
          it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox.

                         FOX
          Does anybody actually read my column? Do
          your friends ever talk about it?

          MRS. FOX

                         (STILL STIRRING)
          Of course. In fact, Rabbit's ex-
          girlfriend just said to me last week, "I
          should read Foxy's column," but they
          don't get the Gazette.
          (yelling into the next room)
          Ash! Let's get cracking!

          Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.

                         (SIGHS)
          I want to say I hate my job, but that
          would make it seem more important to me
          than I want people to think it is.
          Mrs. Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of
          bread. A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the
          bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is
          smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.

                         ASH
          I'm sick.

          MRS. FOX
          You're not sick.

                         ASH
          I have a temperature.
          Mrs. Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his
          forehead.

          MRS. FOX
          You don't have a temperature.
          Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:

                         ASH
          I don't want to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          MRS. FOX
          Hurry up. You're going to be late.
          Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast
          and coffee. Fox whispers to her:

                         FOX
          I love the way you handled that.
          Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:

          MRS. FOX
          Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first
          thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be
          extra nice to him, because he's going
          through a very hard time right now, OK?
          Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white
          cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into
          them. He says aggressively:

                         ASH
          Where's he going to sleep?

          MRS. FOX
          We're going to make a bed for him in your
          room tonight.

                         ASH
          I can't spare the space. Put him in Dad's
          study.
          Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:

                         FOX
          Dad's study is occupied by Dad.
          Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He
          looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:

                         FOX
          I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
          It makes me feel poor.
          Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says

                         SOFTLY:

          MRS. FOX
          We are poor -- but we're happy.
          Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating:

          Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are
          better above ground.
          Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of
          coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:

                         FOX
          I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My
          father died at seven and a half. I don't
          want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm
          going to do something about it.
          Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of
          toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands
          and picks up his cup of coffee.

                         FOX
          Well, I'm off.
          Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on
          the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his
          newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts

                         CHEERILY:

                         FOX
          Have a good day, my darlings!
          Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white
          cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his
          teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves
          briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks
          puzzled.

                         FOX
          What's he wearing?
          Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves
          back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded
          up section of his newspaper.

          A clipping from the real estate section. There is a

          INT. TREE. DAY

          A door opens into a wide, low space with peeling paint. There
          is an old chair against the wall, a bare light bulb hanging

          from the ceiling, and a layer of dust over everything. A
          skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as Fox
          comes into the living room:

                         WEASEL
          Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous.
          Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping
          stone hearth --
          Weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank. He and Fox
          peer into the next room. A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick
          tinkers with some pipes under the kitchen sink. He is Kylie.
          Weasel snaps at him:

                         WEASEL
          What'd I tell you? I'm showing the
          property. You're not supposed to be here.

                         KYLIE
          (checking his watch)
          Oh, cuss. What time is it? I'm sorry.
           Weasel sighs. He waves his arm in Kylie's direction and says
          distractedly, slightly annoyed:

                          WEASEL
           This is Kylie. He's the super.
           (aside to Fix)
          He's a little --
          Weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw. Fox nods. He
          points at a bucket on the floor next to Kylie among bolts,
          tools, and washers.

                         FOX
          What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Just minnows. You want one?

                         FOX
          Certainly. Thank you.
          Kylie reaches into his bucket and hands Fox a live, wriggling
          minnow. Fox swallows it whole.
          Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry
          compounds in the distance. Black smoke pours out of a
          farmhouse chimney on each property. A sign on a water tower
          in the first compound reads Boggis Farms and has a picture of
          a chicken on it. A sign on a silo in the second compound
          reads Bunce Industries and has a picture of a goose on it. A
          sign on a windmill in the third compound reads Bean, inc.

          Weasel says pointedly from across the room:

                         WEASEL
          May I ask what you do for a living, Mr.
          Fox?
          Fox's eyes narrow as he looks out, entranced, with his mouth
          slightly open. He says almost inaudibly:

                         FOX
          I used to steal birds, but now I'm a
          newspaper man.

                         WEASEL

                         (PLEASED)
          Oh, sure. I've seen your by-line.
          Fox snaps out of his reverie and says suddenly:

                         FOX
          Good afternoon, gentlemen.
          Fox shakes hands abruptly with Weasel and starts across the
          room. Weasel is about to ask something when Fox stops in the
          doorway, looks back, and says:

                         FOX
          Oh, and Kylie -- thank you for the
          minnow. It was superb.
          Kylie smiles. Fox exits.

          A beaver dam across a bend in a fast stream. A still pond
          sits above it. There is an entrance tunnel tucked beneath a
          rock.

          INT. BEAVER DAM. DAY

          A large room of twig, stick, and mud construction. A card on
          the door reads Badger, Beaver, and Stoat, L.L.P, Attorneys at
          Law. An anxious badger sits at his desk reviewing some
          documents. Fox paces the floor with his hands clasped behind
          his back.

          Bull-cuss! I'm sugar-coating it, man!
          This is Boggis, Bunce, and Bean! Three of
          the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers in
          the history of this valley!
          An uneasy otter secretary peers in at them from the outer
          office. Fox looks intrigued.

                         FOX
          Really? Tell me about them.
          Silence. Badger sighs. He loosens his tie and settles in.

          All right...

                         CUT TO:
          A fat man with a huge moustache. He wears a tweed suit which
          stretches at the buttons so much that they look like they are
          about to snap off. He holds a carbine rifle. He stands in
          front of his farm, which contains row upon row of chicken
          houses. He has an ugly face. He is Boggis.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Walter Boggis is a chicken farmer.
          Probably the most successful in the
          world.

          Boggis sits at a chopping block tearing into a boiled chicken
          with a fork and a meat cleaver.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's unbelievably fat -- which maybe is
          genetic -- but he also eats three boiled
          chickens smothered with dumplings every
          day for breakfast, lunch, supper, and
          dessert. That's twelve in total, per
          diem.

          Boggis' ear. Furry black and white hairs grow out of it. A
          fly buzzes around, lands on it, and crawls inside. Boggis
          sticks his pinky in after it and scratches.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He never takes a bath, as a result of
          which his ear holes are clogged with all
          kinds of muck and wax and bits of chewing
          gum and dead flies and so on.

          wears overalls and a cap. He holds a twelve-gauge shotgun. He
          stands in front of his farm, which consists of several long
          buildings in rows like a factory. He has a nasty face. He is
          Bunce.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Nathan Bunce is a duck and goosefarmer.
          He owns about 2 million ducksand 500,000
          geese. You might say he's kind ofa pot-
          bellied dwarf of some kind.

          Bunce stands up to his nose in water. The depth reads 4FT.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's so short his chin would probably be
          under water in the shallow end of any
          swimming pool on the planet.

          INT. BUNCE'S KITCHEN. DAY

          Bunce sits on two stacked telephone books on a chair. He guts
          a dead goose, cutting out its liver and mashing it with a
          fork. A plate of doughnuts cools on the table.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He eats only doughnuts with smashed-up
          goose livers injected into them.

          Bean works at a moonshine-type cider still, boiling chemicals
          and sipping from a bottle.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's probably anorexic, because he never
          eats anything. He's on a liquid diet of
          strong, alcoholic cider, which he makes
          from his apples. He's as skinny as a
          pencil, as smart as a whip -- and easily
          the biggest cusshole I've ever met in my

          each other's faces. Suddenly, they calm down all at once,

          Slash I quit. Here's my letter of
          resignation.
          Fox's silhouette throws an envelope onto the squirrel's desk.

                         MONTAGE:
          Two muskrats in orange moving company uniforms unloads boxes
          and furniture from a wagon and carries them into the tree.
          Fox holds open the front door and barks orders at them.
          Two muskrats in white painter's uniforms paints the walls of
          the living room and the trim around the windows with rollers
          and brushes. Fox stands on the drop-cloth and barks orders at
          them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Two muskrats in blue electrician's uniforms work in the
          kitchen. Mrs. Fox watches over their shoulders and barks
          orders at them.
          Fox holds up a pair of flowered curtains in front of a
          window. He looks to Mrs. Fox. She stares at the curtains
          thoughtfully. She raises an eyebrow.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit in the windowsill looking out at the
          sunset. Ash stands in-between them. The flowered curtains
          wave in the breeze. Fox puffs on a pipe. Ash blows a soap
          bubble. Mrs. Fox puts out her paw and a butterfly lands on
          it. She smiles at Fox. He puts his arm around her. He raises
          a pair of binoculars to his eyes.

                         INSERT:
          A binocular shot of an industrial shack with Boggis Chicken
          House #1 stencilled on the front of it.
          Fox lowers the binoculars. His eyes sparkle.

          EXT. TREE. DAY

          Ash stands poised on a high branch over an inflatable
          swimming pool printed with a red-tartan plaid pattern. He
          wears over-sized swim trunks with a pattern of acorns printed
          on them. Fox sits in the grass eating an apple below with
          Mrs. Fox. She is painting at an easel. Ash yells:

                         ASH
          Watch this, Dad!
          Fox looks up. Ash leaps into the air and does a spectacularly
          awkward back-flip during which he appears to have four arms
          and three legs randomly attached to his body, flailing
          wildly. He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks
          into the surface back-first with a pained yelp. Fox grimaces.
          He claps mildly.
          (NOTE: an alternate version of Ash with four arms and three
          legs randomly attached to his body will be used for this
          stunt.)

                         FOX
          Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your
          tail tucked!
          Fox looks at Mrs. Fox's canvas. It is a picture of the pond
          and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and
          lightning bolts. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an
          eyebrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         FOX
          Still painting thunderstorms, I see.
          Fox sees a small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a
          pair of yellow sneakers. He frowns.

                         FOX
          Whose suitcase is that?
          A boy's voice shouts from the high tree branch:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Hello, everyone! Good afternoon!
          Fox, Mrs. Fox, and Ash look up, surprised. A second Fox cub
          stands poised on the edge of the limb. He is taller, leaner,
          sleeker, and it is immediately apparent even by his posture
          infinitely more graceful than Ash. He is Kristofferson. He
          wears a professional Speedo with a patch on it that says Swim
          Team. Fox brightens.

                         FOX
          Kristofferson! Welcome to our little
          tree! I see you brought your swimming
          trunks!
          Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved
          but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox
          leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head,
          whistling and hollering:

                         FOX
          Look at that! This kid's a natural! I'm
          speechless, Kristofferson!
          Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash stares at him
          stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox.

                         FOX
          Plus, he knows karate.

          INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING

          Fox sits in his armchair reading the Gazette. Ash sits on a
          braided rug on the floor beside him reading a comic book
          called The Adventures of White Cape. On the cover, there is a
          picture of a ferret leaping off a motorcycle. Mrs. Fox is in
          the kitchen in the background flattening a hunk of dough with
          a rolling pin. Kristofferson is in the next room practicing
          tae-kwon-do. He wears khaki shorts, yellow sneakers, and a
          blue, short-sleeved, button-down shirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         ASH
          Do you think I'm an athlete?

                         FOX
          (without looking up)
          What are you talking about?

                         ASH
          Well, you know, I think I'm an athlete,
          and sometimes I feel like you guys don't
          see me that way.

                         FOX
          What's the sub-text here?
          Ash thinks for a minute. He looks at Kristofferson in the
          next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the
          floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs
          touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to
          Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:

                         ASH
          How long is Kristofferson supposed to
          stay with us?

          MRS. FOX
          Until your uncle gets better.

                         ASH
          Right, but roughly how long do we plan to
          give him on that? Double-pneumonia isn't
          even really that big of a deal, is it?
          In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts
          practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the
          doorway and whispers forcefully:

          MRS. FOX
          As a matter of fact, it is. He's lucky to
          be alive. Now --

                         ASH
          Right, but --
          Kristofferson yells suddenly as he does a spinning double-
          kick with a chop:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Ki-ya!
          Everyone looks startled. Kristofferson resumes his tae-kwon-
          do practice with an angry, wounded look on his face. Mrs. Fox

                         SAYS COLDLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

          MRS. FOX
          Lower your voice, Ash.

          EXT. TREE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie sit in a porch swing on one of the middle
          branches of Fox's tree. They drink cups of coffee. Crickets
          chirp.

                         FOX
          Kids are crazy, aren't they? You got to
          try it, though. Raising a family.

                         KYLIE
          Yeah. Sometimes I feel like maybe I

                         MIGHT --

                         FOX
          What do you think of this tree, by the
          way? It's great, huh?

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Yeah. No, I was just saying how some-

                         TIMES --

                         FOX
          I have one last part of what I was about
          to say.

                         KYLIE
          OK. Go ahead.

                         FOX
          I'm going broke. You want to help me
          steal some chickens?

                         CUT TO:
          Fox's study, the next morning. A map of the valley with notes
          and arrows written all over it is spread across a desk. The
          door is closed with a towel jammed under it. A cricket match
          plays loudly on the radio. Fox sits in his armchair. Kylie
          sits in a creaky rocking chair.

                         FOX
          I used to do this professionally, and I
          was very successful at it. I had to get
          out of it for personal reasons, but I've
          decided to secretly quit my job slash got
          fired to pursue it again. I'm bringing
          you in as my secretary and personal
          assistant.

                         KYLIE

          OK!

                         FOX

                         (PRICKLY)
          This is actually kind of a big deal, so
          don't just say, "OK!"

                         KYLIE
          OK. Well, thank you.

                         FOX
          (clearing is throat)
           I'm going totape this formyrecords,so
          don't make a lot of sounds --meaning
          stop rocking.

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          Well, maybe we ought to turn off the
          radio, then. That's noisier than --

                         FOX
          I don't want people to eavesdrop on us,
          Kylie. Let me just tell this.
          Kylie stops rocking. Fox presses record on a tape recorder.

                         HE BEGINS:

                         FOX
          Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.

                         CUT TO:
          That night. Fox stands on a rock at the edge of the woods
          looking through his binoculars. He lowers them and gives a
          hand-signal. Kylie joins him, and they start out along the
          moonlit ridge. Fox wears a dark car-coat and a black cap.
          Kylie has on a navy ski-hat.

          FOX (V.0.)
          We'll start with Boggis' Chicken House
          #1. His only security is a few old
          hunting beagles and a low stone wall. Now
          a word about beagles: never look a beagle
          directly in the eye. And if --

          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. Kylie

                         SAYS BLITHELY:

          Beagles aren't so tough.

                         FOX

                         (ANNOYED)
          Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these
          beagles has chronic rabies, which he's on
          medication for, and if you get bit by him
          you have to get shots in your stomach for
          six months. And, second -- listen, I'm
          not going to justify this to you. Just
          pay attention and stop interrupting me.
          I'm taping this.

          EXT. RAVINE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie shimmy down a steep embankment and cross a
          stream.

          FOX (V.0.)
          I picked some blueberries, butterflied
          them with a scalpel, and laced each one

          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
          smoke pipes.

          How do we make them eat it?

                         FOX
          (smiling, with utter certainty)
          Beagles love blueberries.

          EXT. RIDGE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie push through a bramble and climb to the top of
          an elderberry bush. Fox looks through his binoculars.

          FOX (V.O.)
          If we approach with the wind in our
          faces, we'll smell the chicken livers on
          Boggis' breath from at least fifty yards
          away.

          EXT. BARNYARD. DAY

          Seventy-five chickens stand around quietly but anxiously,
          darting wildly nervous looks at one another. They eat bits of
          grain off the ground.

          FOX (V.O.)
          Remember: they aren't very smart, but
          they're incredibly paranoid -- so always
          kill a chicken in one bite.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
          drink whiskey sours. Fox repeats:

                         FOX
          One bite, get it?
          Fox waits for Kylie to respond. Kylie does not. Fox frowns.

                         FOX
          Are you listening to me? I look into your
          eyes and I can't tell whether you're
          getting anything I'm saying.
          Kylie stares at Fox vacantly. He shrugs.
          (NOTE: an alternate set of eyeballs will be used for any
          shots indicating Kylie's vacant look.)

          EXT. MEADOW. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie move swiftly through the tall grass. Fox pauses
          to sniff the air. He nods.

                         FOX
          A few beagles, as we discussed, but we're
          ready for that.
          Fox and Kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow
          ditch. Fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the
          air.

                         FOX
          You feel that? The wind's in our faces.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          Kylie touches his face with his paw. He nods. Fox and Kylie
          run along the edge of the ditch. Kylie says casually:

                         KYLIE
          Yeah, back in the old days, didn't they
          used to do a thing where if somebody saw
          a wolf, and --

                         (STARTLED)
          What wolf?
          Fox stops in his tracks. His eyes dart about. Kylie looks at
          him curiously.

                         FOX
          Oh, nothing? Never mind.
          Fox and Kylie veer off into shorter grasses. Fox points
          ahead, regaining his composure:

                         FOX
          Here comes the low stone wall. Not a
          problem.
          Fox and Kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves
          at the base of a chain-link fence eleven feet high.

                         FOX
          This is a chain-link fence, I guess. Did
          I not remember this? Maybe it's new.
          Let's pause.

                         (SUDDENLY ANGRY)
          What the cuss? Where'd this giant fence
          come from? We had a master plan!
          Kylie motions to a yellow, plywood lightning bolt posted to
          the fence.

                         KYLIE
          What's this lightning bolt stand for?

                         FOX
          Give me a second! I said, "Let's pause"!
          Pause. Fox pulls himself together. He turns to look at the
          plywood lightning bolt.

                         FOX
          That, I guess, hypothetically, could mean
          maybe this fence might be electric.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         KYLIE
          Well, I just hope it doesn't mean
          thunder. I have a phobia of that.
          Fox and Kylie climb a tree and crouch at the end of one of
          its branches. Fox produces a zip-loc bag filled with
          blueberries with white thread stitched into them.

                         FOX
          Watch this.
          Fox puts a blueberry into the end of a straw and shoots it
          out into the barnyard.

                         CUT TO:
          The blueberry landing on the ground in front of Chicken House
          #1. A beagle approaches it and sniffs at it. He eats it. He
          looks very pleased. He falls over, out cold.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox with an ecstatic expression on his face. He rapidly
          shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard. Beagles
          eat blueberries and fall over, one after another. Fox and
          Kylie drop down into the barnyard and head for Chicken House
          #1. Fox whispers excitedly as they run:

                         FOX
          Beagles love blueberries! Didn't I tell
          you? The master plan's working again!
          Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an
          unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and they
          weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance
          to the chicken house, open the door, and duck inside.
          Pause. There is an eruption of crazed squawking, screaming,
          and fighting from inside. The chicken house rumbles. Lights
          jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes off. Voices yell.
          The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and Kylie
          emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead
          chickens, and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:

                         FOX
          I said one bite, cuss it!

                         KYLIE
          I'm trying! I have a different kind of
          teeth from you! I'm an opossum!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          Kylie tries to bite the chicken on the neck. The chicken is
          unharmed. Kylie shrugs. Fox kills the chicken with one quick
          flick of the jaws. Kylie looks horrified.

                         KYLIE
          That's so grisly! There's blood and
          everything!

                         FOX

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          We're killing chickens! There's going to
          be blood in this story! Follow me!
          Fox and Kylie dash to the electric fence. They stop in front
          of it. Kylie looks to Fox.

                         KYLIE
          What's the master escape plan?
          Fox hesitates, confused. A gunshot fires from among the
          chicken houses. Fox shouts to Kylie:

                         FOX
          Follow me again!
          Fox and Kylie run back across the barnyard, past the beagles
          as they begin to wake up and stagger around. Farmhands
          appear, loading shotguns and running into the confusion. Fox
          and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them. They dart into the
          house through a flap in the back door. The lights are out in
          the kitchen. They take a moment, breathing hard in the
          darkness. Kylie shakes his head in disbelief.

                         KYLIE
          Wow. That was amazing. How did we do
          that? We ran the other way or something.

                         FOX
          Yeah.

                         KYLIE
          What happens now?

                         FOX
          I have no idea.
          Fox opens the door-flap a crack. He looks out and sees Boggis
          opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands,
          barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox
          shouts to Kylie:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         FOX
          Holy cuss! They opened the gate! Follow
          me again!
          Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door-
          flap, race across the barnyard, and dart through the open
          gate. Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with
          his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the
          bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says

                         BREATHLESSLY:

                         FOX
          Let's hit the five and dime on the way
          home! We need to make some fake price
          tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper
          so it looks like we got them at the
          butcher shop!
          Fox and Kylie howl ecstatically.

                         MONTAGE:
          A fox's paw lifts a silver dome off a perfectly roasted
          chicken with an apple in its mouth.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at a candle-lit table eating chicken and
          drinking wine. Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at a
          slightly miniature table eating chicken and drinking milk.
          Fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife a story. Wine
          comes out of his nose.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the door of Boggis' Chicken House #7
          carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt on. Farmhands
          run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
          cut into the electric fence.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the window of Bunce's Poultry Barn C
          carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring. Farmhands
          run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
          knocked into a brick wall.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean's Apple Orchard XII
          carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples. Automatic
          doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie
          escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade.
          Fox and Kylie run full-speed through a clover field in the
          dark. The camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford
          a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and cross into the willow
          glade. They look exhilarated.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          INT. KITCHEN. EVENING

          Mrs. Fox studies a crayon price-tag labelled $4 attached to a
          wax-paper-wrapped parcel. She opens the parcel and holds up a
          dead chicken by the leg. There is a small metal clip around
          its ankle. She examines it. She frowns.
          Fox comes in, grabs an apple out of a bowl, and starts back
          out of the room.

          MRS. FOX
          Where'd you get this chicken?

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last
          night on my way back from --

          MRS. FOX
          It's got a Boggis Farms tag around its
          ankle.

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Huh. Must've escaped from there before I
          bought it.

          INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING

          Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at the children's table
          eating dinner. Next to Ash, there is a small, slightly beaten-
          up statue of a fox with his front legs raised in the air
          holding a medal above his head. Kylie points at it.

                         KYLIE
          What's that?

                         ASH
          This? Nothing. Just some old trophy I won
          for being an athlete.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at the adults' table. Fox guzzles down a
          last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food:

                         FOX
          I'm supposed to cover this book party at
          some animal's nest in a tobacco field
          down the hill, so me and Kylie are going
          to hop over there and give it a whirl.
          Don't wait up.
          Fox pulls his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the
          table, and stands up. Mrs. Fox asks cooly:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          MRS. FOX
          What's the book?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Some memoir. I'll get him to sign you a
          copy.
          Fox kisses Mrs. Fox on the cheek. She looks at him
          suspiciously.

                         FOX
          Dinner was --
           (doing a little gesture)
          -- pitch-perfect.

          EXT. WOODS. NIGHT

           Fox and Kylie walk among the trees. They are dressed in their
          prowling outfits.

                         FOX
          I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars
          underneath the back door to Bean's secret
          cider cellar.

                         KYLIE
          We're breaking into Bean's house?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Cellar.

                         KYLIE
          Where he lives?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Where he keeps the cider.

                         ASH

                         (BRIGHTLY)
          Below where he lives.
          Ash, dressed in his own prowling outfit, is walking with Fox
          and Kylie. Fox stops short:

                         FOX
          Where'd you come from? Go back to the
          tree and do your homework!

                         ASH
          I want to help you steal some cider.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          We're going to a book party! And keep
          your mouth shut about any cider, because
          no one ever said that! Get out of here!

                         ASH
          But Dad --

                         FOX
          But nothing! You're going to get me in a
          lot of trouble!
          The three animals stand in silence for a minute. Fox points
          to his tree. Ash turns and starts back home. Fox shakes his
          head.

                         FOX
          Where the cuss does that kid get off? Can
          you believe that? How'd he get tipped
          off? You think he's going to tell on us?
          Fox turns to Kylie. Kylie looks back at him vacantly.

                         FOX
          Before we go any further, from now on can
          you give me some kind of signal once in a
          while just so I know any of this is
          getting through to you?
          Pause. Kylie makes a slight motion with his paw. Fox
          hesitates.

                         FOX
          Was that it? OK.

          EXT. BARNYARD. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie dart across the yard and around the back of
          Bean's farmhouse. Kylie whispers as they run:

                         KYLIE
          One time this wolf --

                         FOX

                         (IRRITATED)
          What's with all the wolf talk? Can we
          give it a rest, for once?
          Fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window
          shutter. He and Kylie shimmy in-between two bent burglar
          bars.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          INT. BEAN'S SECRET CIDER CELLAR. NIGHT

          A vast, damp, gloomy cellar with hundreds of glass jars
          stacked from floor to ceiling. Each jar is marked Cider. Fox
          and Kylie come inside and quietly drop to the brick floor.

                         KYLIE WHISPERS:

                         KYLIE
          Look at all this apple juice.

                         FOX

                         (STERNLY)
          Apple juice? Apple juice? We didn't come
          here for apple juice. This is some of the
          strongest, finest alcoholic cider money
          can buy -- or that can even be stolen. It
          burns in your throat, boils in your
          stomach, and tastes almost exactly like
          pure, melted gold.

                         (SUDDENLY)
          Let's crack open one these 'shine jars
          and do a shooter.
          A match strikes in the darkness. Fox and Kylie look around
          the room frantically. On the highest shelf, peering out from
          behind a huge jar, they see an enormous rat in a striped
          shirt with a lit match in his claw. He puts the flame in his
          mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth.
          He is longer than a fox and wiry, but with a small pot-belly.
          He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik.
          He takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck
          of his cider jar. He says with a slightly sinister New

                         ORLEANS ACCENT:

                         RAT
          Y'all are trespassin', now. Illegally.
          'Round these parts, we don't take kindly
          to cider poachers.
          Fox and Rat stare at each other. Fox says, finally:

                         FOX
          You've aged badly, Rat.

                         RAT
          You're gettin' a little long in the
          tooth, yourself, partner.
          Rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a shelf,
          down the wall, and through the air onto the brick floor at
          Fox's feet. He flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it.
          He hisses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Kylie shrieks and darts into a hole where a brick is missing
          in the wall. Fox takes an old-fashioned boxing stance.

                         RAT
          How's your old lady doin'?
          Kylie peers out from his hole in the wall nervously. Fox and
          Rat circle each other slowly.

                         FOX
          Do you refer to my wife?

                         RAT
          She was the town tart, in her day. Wild
          and foot-loose and pretty as a mink
          stole. She was a creme brulee -- until
          you made an honest woman out of her, Mr.
          Fox.
          Kylie says, intrigued, from his hole:

                         KYLIE
          Is that true?

                         FOX

                         (ANNOYED)
          Of course, not. I mean, certainly, she
          lived. We all did. It was a different
          time. Let's not use a double-standard.
          She marched against the --

                         KYLIE
          But town tart?

                         FOX
          Shut up.
          Rat lunges at Fox with his switchblade. Fox dodges nimbly. He
          cocks an eyebrow and smiles:

                         FOX
          That was close, Rat. Be careful.

                         RAT
          Oh, I'm as careful as a --
          A door at the top of the stairs opens suddenly with a loud
          creak. Rat and Fox look terrified. They both dart away and
          hide behind cider jars.
          A heavy-set, middle-aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin
          comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf
          where Fox is hiding.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          How many jars should I bring up, ma'am?
          A strong, almost masculine woman's voice answers from

                         UPSTAIRS:

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          I don't know. Two, I guess.
          The housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one
          Fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm. Fox tenses
          his body. He shivers slightly. A graze of the red fur of his
          arm sticks out barely from behind his jar. The housekeeper
          hesitates.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          He drank three yesterday, ma'am.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          All right, take three.
          The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar. Fox closes his eyes.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          No, don't.
          The housekeeper stops with her hand on the neck of Fox's jar.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          Three's too many. It's unhealthy. He's
          anorexic. Bring two.
          The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar. Fox relaxes slightly.
          The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar again. Fox tenses up.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          But maybe, just in case --

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          Two's plenty.
          The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar and walks away. She goes
          back up the stairs and closes the door. Kylie says in the

                         DARKNESS:

                         KYLIE
          Oh, my cuss. That was like a scene out of

                         A --
          The door opens again. An exceptionally tall, powerfully built
          woman in a black dress and Wellingtons, with grey hair pulled-
          back in a bun, bright green eyes, and a meat cleaver tucked
          under her apron strings comes swiftly down the stairs. She

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          eyeballs the corners of the room. She is Mrs. Bean. She says
          thickly (in her masculine voice):

          MRS. BEAN
          To whom it may concern: if I catch a rat
          in a black beret drinking Mr. Bean's
          secret cider without his express
          permission, I intend to chop said rat's
          head off, brine it, pickle it, and bake
          it in a vermin casserole. I hope this
          clarifies my position on the matter.
          Sincerely, Evelyn Bean.
          Mrs. Bean turns and goes back up the stairs. She closes the
          door. Pause. Rat's voice says from the shadows:

                         RAT
          Dear Mrs. Bean, your language, while
          somewhat purple, is nevertheless
          impossible to misinterpret. However --
          comma -- given the proximity of said rat
          at the moment of your --
          The door at the top the stairs opens again. Silence.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie running away from Bean's farmhouse with two
          jars of cider. They both look badly shaken. A gunshot rings
          out taking us to:

          EXT. BEAN FARMS. NIGHT

          Bean is standing darkly in his front doorway. Smoke drifts
          from the end of his Luger, pointed at the ceiling. A broken
          light bulb hangs from a wire above his head. Boggis and Bunce
          sit together on the porch in rocking chairs, startled,
          staring at Bean.

                         BEAN
          I'm going to give a speech, and at the
          end of it -- I'm going to throw a twist
          into this plot.
          Bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the
          porch.

                         BEAN
          First truth: this is the most ambitious
          fox we've ever encountered, bar none.
          Bean spins around and shoots out a second light bulb. Boggis
          and Bunce look uneasy. Bean continues:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         BEAN
          Second truth: the meaning of ambition is
          defined in the dictionary.
          Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb.

                         BEAN
          Third truth: the weakness of the
          ambitious man is his Achilles heel --
          Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his
          back, over his shoulder, and between his legs. The porch goes
          dark. He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two
          colleague's faces. They look scared. Bean says urgently:

                         BEAN
          -- but I've already figured out where
          this fox lives, and tomorrow night we're
          going to camp in the bushes, wait for him
          to come out of the hole in his tree, and
          shoot the cuss to smithereens. How's that
          grab you, fellas?
          Boggis and Bunce hesitate. They nod and murmur their
          approval.

          INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie come quietly into the half-lit kitchen dressed
          in their prowling outfits. They walk to the door.

          MRS. FOX
          Another book party?
          Fox and Kylie turn around, startled. Mrs. Fox sits on a stool
          in the darkened pantry.

                         FOX
          Woah! I didn't see you. Sitting in the
          dark over there. Yeah, no. Actually,
          there's a fire. I just got the call. They
          said maybe it's arson? I got to interview
          the marshall and see what's --

          MRS. FOX
          Kylie, is he telling the truth?

                         KYLIE

                         (FREAKING OUT)
          I don't want to be put in the middle of
          this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          Thanks, Kylie.

          MRS. FOX
          If what I think is happening is

                         HAPPENING --

                         (OMINOUSLY)
          -- it better not be.

                         CUT TO:
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in the bushes. Bean
          licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the
          wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to
          Boggis and Bunce.

          EXT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

          Fox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He
          moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a
          moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says

                         STONILY:

                         FOX
          Nice job covering for me. Next time

                         TRY --
          A twig snaps. Fox freezes.

                         CUT TO:
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes.

                         CUT TO:
          The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its
          direction.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a
          row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking:

                         FOX
          All three!
          Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A
          barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark.
          Silence.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air.
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his
          flashlight on Fox's hole.
          In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood-
          stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it
          in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce.

                         BEAN
          We got the tail, but we missed the fox.
          Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie.

                         BEAN
          Petey? You and the boys sober up and get
          out here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven
          shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds of
          ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider.

          INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

          Mrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with
          gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox
          cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly:

                         ASH
          It'll grow back, won't it?

                         KYLIE
          (shaking his head)
          Tails don't grow back, except for
          lizards.

                         FOX

                         (MISERABLY)
          Tails don't grow back. I'm going to be
          tail-less for the rest of my life.

                         ASH

                         (NERVOUSLY)
          Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as
          double-pneumonia, right?
          (pointing to Kristofferson)
          His dad's got one foot in the grave and
          one foot on a banana peel. That's a lot
          worse than --
          Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor. It
          ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls
          silent. Kristofferson turns away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Excuse me, everyone. I'm going to go
          meditate for half an hour.
          Kristofferson walks out of the room. Mrs. Fox looks at Ash
          and says angrily:

          MRS. FOX
          You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up
          with a proper apology.
          Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares
          straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly:

                         FOX
          What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape
          and the pants tucked into your socks?
          Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging
          his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back
          to the room.

                         FOX
          I got fired slash quit the Gazette and
          started stealing chickens on the sly.

          MRS. FOX

                         (ICILY)
          That tail was the first thing I ever
          noticed about you. It was easily the most
          attractive tail for at least 50 miles in
          every direction. It was probably your
          single best quality -- and now it's gone
          forever.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox lying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark next to
          Mrs. Fox.

                         FOX
          Why the cuss didn't I listen my lawyer?
          At this point we'll be lucky if we can
          flip this tree for half of what we've
          already sunk into it.
          Fox flips over onto his stomach.

                         FOX
          I won't be able to sleep on my back for
          six weeks -- and on my stomach I feel
          congested. Why the cuss didn't I listen
          to my lawyer?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

          MRS. FOX

                         (BITTERLY)
          Because you don't listen to anybody.

                         FOX
          (sitting up suddenly)
          What was that?

          MRS. FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          What? I said --
           There is a quiet scraping sound from above. Fox jumps out of
          bed. He hollers:

                          FOX
           Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us
          out!
          There is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above. Mrs. Fox
          looks at Fox intensely:

          MRS. FOX
          They'll kill the children!

                         FOX

                         (STEELY)
          Over my dead body, they will.

          MRS. FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          That's what I'm saying! You'd be dead,
          too, in that scenario!

                         FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          Well, I'm arguing against that!

          MRS. FOX

                         (SCREAMING)
          What are you talking about?

                         FOX

                         (SCREAMING)
          Why are you yelling at me?

                         KYLIE

                         (AGONIZED)
          Stop! Stop! Stop!
          Fox and Mrs. Fox turn quickly to Kylie standing in the
          doorway with a red blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Ash

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          and Kristofferson stand behind him. They look terrified.
          Kylie shouts in a pained voice:

                         KYLIE
          You say one thing, she says another, and
          it all changes back again!
          The point of a shovel pierces the ceiling. Everyone looks up
          and stares in shock. Fox suddenly leaps across the room with
          a wild energy, scrambles halfway up a wall, and throws over
          two chairs.

                         FOX
          I've got it! There's not a moment to
          lose! Why didn't I think of this before?

          MRS. FOX
          Think of what?

                         FOX
          Think of the one thing a fox does quicker
          than a man, quicker than any other animal
          in the world!
          (at the top of his lungs)

          DIG!!!

                         CUT TO:
          Everyone digging furiously. Dirt flies everywhere. The shot
          booms down into the ground, among the roots of the tree,
          through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean
          mineral deposits.

                         TITLE:

                         1 HOUR LATER
          The shot stops at the bottom of a dark hole deep, deep
          underground. Mrs. Fox lies on the floor, breathing heavily,
          with a lit lantern at her side. The cubs are sprawled out
          around her. Kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off tied
          around his waist. Fox stands up and clears his throat.
          Everyone looks at him.

                         FOX
          I think it's time for me to give us a pep
          talk and explain some things.

          A very long time ago --

          Just on the other side of this mineral
          deposit. Follow me.
          Fox reluctantly follows Mrs. Fox through a crack in the
          bedrock and into a small air-pocket with glittering quartz
          walls. She wheels on Fox:

          MRS. FOX
          I'm going to lose my temper now.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          When?

          MRS. FOX
          Right now.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          Well, when --
          Mrs. Fox scratches Fox across the face, slicing a quick
          sliver into his fur. Fox cringes away with his paws up
          protectively. He lowers his paws. His eyes fill with tears.
          (NOTE: the scar in Fox's fur never grows back.)
          Mrs. Fox takes a deep breath. She says:

          MRS. FOX
          Twelve fox-years ago, you made a promise
          to me while we were caged inside that fox-
          trap that, if we survived, you would
          never steal another chicken, goose,
          turkey, duck, or squab, whatever they
          are. I believed you. Why did you lie to
          me?

                         FOX

                         (SIMPLY)
          Because I'm a wild animal.

          MRS. FOX
          You're also a husband and a father.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         FOX

                         (PAINED)
          I'm trying to tell you the truth about
          myself.

          MRS. FOX
          I don't care about the truth about
          yourself.
          Fox looks down at the ground. He nods and tries to contain
          his emotions. Mrs. Fox watches him coldly.

          MRS. FOX
          This story is too predictable.

                         FOX

                         (SURPRISED)
          Predictable? Really? What happens in the
          end?

          MRS. FOX

                         (QUIETLY)
          In the end, we all die -- unless you
          change.
          Mrs. Fox walks out of the air-pocket. Fox stands alone in
          silence.

          EXT. FOX'S TREE. DAY

          The next morning. There is a large hole in the side of the
          hill, under Fox's tree. The ceiling to the living room has
          been completely removed. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand half-
          underground with their heads sticking out of the hole,
          breathing hard, with dirty shovels over their shoulders.
          Bunce stands on Fox's tiny club chair.

                         BUNCE
          These foxes dig like a bunch of
          hyperactive gophers.

                         BOGGIS
          Franklin? You got another twist for this
          plot?

                         BEAN
          Say that again?

                         BOGGIS
          I say you got another --
          Bean whips out his walkie-talkie and twirls it like a six-
          shooter. He presses a button on it and says:

          Petey? Get me the current contact info
          for Earl Malloy on the A.S.A.P.

                         (INTRIGUED)
          Who's Earl Malloy?

                         BEAN

                         (INNOCENTLY)
          What? You mean over at Malloy
          Consolidated? Oh, he does rentals.

                         BOGGIS

                         (PAUSE)
          What does he rent?

                         CUT TO:
          Three yellow and black, murderous, brutal bulldozer digging-
          tractors with Malloy Consolidated painted on the sides of
          them. They make a terrible, high-pitched growling noise and
          spit black grease and smoke.
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand among the tractors nodding
          giddily to each other. They scramble into the drivers' seats
          and begin ripping into the hillside. Bunce sits on a
          dictionary to see over the dashboard.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox, Mrs. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson digging
          frantically.

                         CUT TO:
          The tractors grabbing huge chunks of earth and tossing them
          into the meadow. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, drunk with digging,
          laugh manically as the controls of their tractors.

                         BEAN
          Let's kick some fox cuss!

                         BUNCE
          I'm cussing loving this!

                         BOGGIS
          Who's hyper-cussing-active now?
          Bean throws his tractor into top gear. The teeth of the giant
          shovels clank against each other, ripping through the tree's
          roots.

          A grizzled, white-haired man in a greasy yellow and black
          jumpsuit and coke-bottle protective eyeglasses. A patch on
          his pocket says E. Malloy. He watches the farmers digging
          crazily with the tractors. Sparks from the mayhem reflect
          dancing on his lenses.

                         EARL MALLOY
          These machines weren't made to be handled
          like this.

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          The hill with half its earth dug out from under the tree. The
          tree still stands precariously above the wild tractors.

          The hill now razed with the fallen, old beech tree laying on
          its side as the tractors dig deeper.

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          The tractors almost completely below ground in a deep crater.
          A crowd of neighbors and local press from the town has
          gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble
          up out of the crater. The motors go quiet. Boggis, Bunce, and
          Bean climb down from their tractors. They look angry and
          tired. They stand among the workers and onlookers.
          A television reporter with an Action 13 camera crew confronts

                         BEAN:

                         REPORTER
          Farmer, correct me if I'm misreading the
          data, you've successfully destroyed the
          scenery, but the alleged fox remains at

          farmers do now?

          Well, Dan, I can tell you what we're not
          going to do. We're not going to let him
          go.

          I have no further dialogue in this scene.
          Bean turns away from the reporter and pulls Boggis and Bunce
          aside. He addresses them with calm intensity:

                         BEAN
          I'm not going home until we smoke this
          son-of-a-cuss out his hole, string him up
          on a clothesline, and fly him like a
          kite. Boggis, how many men have you got
          working on your farm?

                         BOGGIS
          Thirty-five.

           And I've got thirty-seven. That's 108 men
           altogether. Now what do I got here? Two

          around the perimeter. They sit on bricks and logs and are
          armed with bats, pistols, rifles, shotguns, bows and arrows,

          Fox, his family, and Kylie lie exhausted on the floor of

          EXT. CAMP. NIGHT

          There is a full moon. Lanterns glow in the farmers' tents. A
          group of farmhands sit around a campfire next to the crater.
          One of them cooks a chicken on a spit. Another sits on a log
          playing a banjo. He is Petey. He sings:

                         PETEY
          'Bout a handsome little fox
          Let me sing you folks a yarn.

          'Twas a splendid little feller
          Full of wit 'n' grace 'n' charm.
          Say, zippy-zee, yappy-yo, google-gum!
          The shot moves past the leathery faces of the other farmhands
          as they listen: amused, moved, hungry, tired, charmed,
          annoyed, whistling, playing a jew's harp, trying to sing
          along but not really knowing the words, etc.

                         PETEY
          Like any little critter needin'
          Vittels for his littl'uns,
          Well, he stole, and he cheated,
          And he lied to survive.

          But that stylish little fox
          Was as clever as a whip.
          Dug as quick as a gopher
          Who was a hyper-ack-a-tive.
          Now those three farmers sit
          'Twhere there's a hole 'twas once a hill.
          Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do, doodle-dum!
          And as far as I can reckon
          They're a-settin' up there still.

          Petey stops short. Everyone turns quickly and sees Bean
          standing over them in the darkness with his Luger in one hand
          and a cigarette in the other. Petey looks nervous.

                         PETEY
          I don't know. I was just kind of making
          it up as I was going along...
          Petey trails off. Bean shakes his head. He looks highly
          irritated.

                         BEAN
          That's just weak song-writing! You wrote
          a bad song, Petey!
          Bean throws his cigarette into the campfire. He storms away.
          Petey turns to the other farmhands. Everyone looks
          uncomfortable.

          completely dehydrated and starve to
          death.

                         ASH
          What's that?
          Ash points. Everyone looks. A tiny hole appears in the wall
          at the end of the tunnel. Dirt crumbles out of it -- and a
          bit of metal catches a glint. Fox and his family watch,
          frozen. A breath of air blows into the tunnel.
          The flame on Mrs. Fox's lantern flickers once and goes out.

                         ASH STARTS:

                         (WHISPERS SHARPLY)
          Not a sound!
          Silence. There is a sudden, loud scrabbling noise. A match
          strikes. Fox touches it to Mrs. Fox's lantern-wick.
          The tiny hole in the wall has become a large one. Badger
          stands in front of Fox with his law partner Beaver, Beaver's
          overgrown, hulking son, a medium-sized mole, and a grey field
          mouse with a bandana tied in a "do-rag" style around his
          head. Badger has a spoon in his hand. Fox and Badger erupt at
          each other, screaming simultaneously:

                         FOX
          You scared the cuss out of us!

                         BADGER

          We're all cussing starving to death
          because of you, you mangy, cussing,
          little cuss!
          Fox and Badger snarl and scratch at each other, circling
          around the hole. They calm down slightly. Badger continues:

                         BADGER
          We've been digging in circles for three
          days. Half the woods've been obliterated.
          Nobody can get out. Right now my wife's
          huddled at the bottom of the flint-mine
          with Mrs. Mole, Mrs. Beaver, Rabbit's ex-
          girlfriend, no food, no water, and twenty-
          seven hungry, whining, starving, little
          animal brats. This is a total cluster-
          cuss for everybody!
          Fox looks around the room at the entire gaunt, dirty,
          emaciated assembly. Everyone stares at him angrily. He
          swallows. The mole says softly.:

                         MOLE
          I just want to see a little --

                         (SUDDENLY CRYING)
          -- sunshine.

                         FOX

                         (PUZZLED)
          But you're nocturnal, Phil. Your eyes
          barely even open, on a good day.

                         MOLE

                         (ENRAGED)
          I'm sick of your double-talk. We have
          rights!
          Beaver's son looms over Ash and Kristofferson in a muddy
          alcove on the side of the tunnel. He pokes Ash in the chest
          with the finger of his paw.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         BEAVER'S SON
          We don't like you, and we hate your dad.
          You're too snazzy. You dress like a girl.
          You're creative. Now grab some of that
          mud, chew it in your mouth, and swallow
          it.

                         ASH
          (scared and disgusted)
          I'm not going to eat mud!

                         BEAVER'S SON
          Cuss, yeah, you are.
          Beaver's son grabs a handful of mud, smashes it into Ash's
          mouth, and forces his jaws up and down in a chewing motion.
          Ash coughs and splutters. Kristofferson frowns. He takes off
          his shoes with his feet. He says with a quiet ferocity:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Don't do that.
          Beaver's son looks to Kristofferson. He looks down at
          Kristofferson's feet.

                         BEAVER'S SON
          Why'd you take your shoes off?

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          So I don't break your nose when I kick
          it.
          Kristofferson kicks Beaver's son in the face, karate chops
          his neck, elbow-jabs him twice in the gut, and flips the
          enormous youth over his shoulder and into the mud. Beaver's
          son gets up, crying, and walks out of the alcove.
          Ash watches blankly with mud all over his mouth as
          Kristofferson puts his shoes back on.

                         ASH
          I can fight my own fights.
          Badger and Fox stand facing each other at the end of the
          tunnel. Badger says aggressively:

                         BADGER
          Those farmers aren't going to quit until
          they've got you and every member of your
          family nailed upside-down to a bloody
          stick with your eyes gorged out.

                         (FREAKED OUT)
          This is getting a little too personal.
          Badger waits for Fox to continue. Fox stares into space.

                         FOX
          Give me a minute.
          Fox turns and walks away. He faces the wall of the tunnel. He
          sits down on a rock. Everyone watches him uncertainly. They
          look at each other. Badger starts to say something, but Kylie
          cuts him off sharply:

                         KYLIE

                         (SHARPLY)
          Shh!
          Badger falls silent. Fox sits with his chin on his paw, lost
          in concentrated thought. He stands up. He nods repeatedly and
          begins to pace. His eyes dart from one spot to another. His
          paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and
          shapes. He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of
          the tunnel. He snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the
          others. He says with a cautious excitement:

                         FOX
          I've got an idea.

                         BADGER

                         (TENTATIVELY)
          What is it?

                         FOX
          It could be a good one.

                         BEAVER

                         (POINTEDLY)
          Lay it on us.

                         FOX
          It might save our lives.

                         KYLIE

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Say the idea!
          Fox looks down at Ash, who stands beside him with mud still
          on his mouth. He nods. He says suddenly:

                         FOX
          All right! Let's try it!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Fox runs over to Mrs. Fox:

                         FOX
          Go to the flint-mine. Tell Mrs. Badger,
          Rabbit's ex-girlfriend, et al. that help
          is on the way.

          MRS. FOX

                         (SKEPTICALLY)
          Is help on the way?
          Fox grips Mrs. Fox's paw. He looks into her eyes and says

                         INTENSELY:

                         FOX
          I sure as cuss hope so.
          Mrs. Fox detects a special, familiar, inspired light in her
          husband's eyes at this moment. She nods. She hands Ash the
          lantern. She straightens the neck-line of his cape, licks the
          mud off Ash's snout, and scrambles away down Badger's tunnel.
          Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the others.

                         FOX
          Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a
          very special direction.
          Fox feels the walls with his paws. Everyone watches
          attentively.

                         FOX
          I got to kind of feel out the vibe.
          Fox stops. He points slightly downwards and due south. He
          says with quiet anticipation:

                         FOX
          Begin.
          Everyone starts digging, slowly but intently.

                         CUT TO:
          The diggers one hundred yards later. Fox suddenly whistles
          and raises his fist.
          The diggers stop digging. Fox feels the ceiling with his
          paws. He knocks something hard. It sounds hollow. He looks at
          the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow.
          Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard. It creaks loudly. They
          all duck down and wait. Nothing happens. Fox pushes up a
          second floorboard. He cautiously pokes his head up through

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          the gap. He lets out a shriek of excitement and whispers
          excitedly down to the others:

                         FOX
          I've done it! I've done it, first time!
          Come up and see where you are, my
          darlings!
          Everyone scrambles up out of the tunnel.

          INT. SHED. NIGHT

          Everyone stands in the middle of Boggis' Chicken House #1.
          The room is teeming with chickens, which stare at them
          nervously. There are black chickens, white chickens, brown
          chickens, and one that combines all three colors. Fox

                         WHISPERS:

                         FOX
          I hit it slap in the middle! Do you get
          how incredible this is?
          The others nod. They look dazed and wild. Fox holds up his
          hands and whispers:

                         FOX
          Don't lose your heads, now. Let's do this
          properly. First, everyone have a drink of
          water.
          Fox leads the others over to the chickens' drinking trough.
          They all lap up the cool water. Fox dries his mouth.

                         FOX

                         SECOND --
          Fox seizes a black chicken violently.

                         CUT TO:
          Ash and Kristofferson running down the tunnel carrying two
          dead, black chickens. They turn three corners and arrive at
          the mossy hollow. They look inside.

                         MONTAGE:
          Fox and the other diggers tunnel under the silo in front of
          Bunce Industries. Cows eat grass in the pasture above.
          Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor
          and dance an ecstatic jig in a great storeroom lined to the
          ceiling with plucked ducks and geese. Smoked hams and sides
          of bacon dangle from the rafters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          Fox and the other diggers tunnel under the windmill in front
          of Bean, inc. Sheep eat clover in the field above.
          Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor
          and dance an ecstatic jig in a corrugated plastic and metal
          pen among dozens of gobbling turkeys.
          Fox and the other diggers race dancing ecstatically back
          through the complex network of tunnels carrying dead turkeys,
          geese, bacon, flour, salt, sugar, jars of cider, and a
          portable television set.

          INT. FLINT-MINE. DAY

          The flint-mine is a large but cozy space with stone walls, a
          dirt floor, a small kitchen, and a fireplace. There are rows
          of cots, sleeping bags, boxes, blankets, and suitcases for
          all the refugee animals. All the animals have gathered
          together and drink cider cocktails while small rabbits,
          skunks, and field mice set the table. The room is festooned
          with garlands. A well-dressed mole smoking a pipe plays the
          piano. A bespectacled rabbit leans against it humming a tune.
          Weasel stands in the corner talking with Beaver.

                         WEASEL
          What am I going to do? I'm going to hold
          him to the terms of the contract. It's
          not my fault they uprooted it.
          Kristofferson serves cranberry punch from a tureen in the
          corner. Ash goes over to him and holds out a mug.

                         ASH
          They say I owe you an apology for some of
          the mean things I said about your
          father's illness. His double-pneumonia or
          whatever they're calling it now.
          Kristofferson ladles Ash a cupful.

                         KRISTOFFERSON

          OK.

                         ASH
          So there it is. I hope we can continue
          our relationship as cousins or family
          members or however you want to define

                         IT --
          (suddenly more intense)
          -- but do me a favor for yourself. The
          next time you have a problem with
          something I've said, come to me as a fox

                         ASH (CONT'D)
          and let's deal with it right then and not
          let it blow up into a whole, huge thing
          involving parents and so on. Agreed?
          Ash drinks his punch in one long sip and holds out the empty
          mug for a refill. Kristofferson nods slowly. He points at Ash
          with his ladle.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          I'm going to teach you karate.
          Badger sits next to the fireplace with Fox and Kylie.

                         BADGER
          I can imagine how painful, even just
          emotionally, that must be for you.

                         FOX

          Well, you know, it's not the end of the
          world.

          your whole tail blown clean off by a --

                         (COOLY)
          Can we drop it?
          Kristofferson starts to refill Ash's mug again. Ash suddenly
          puts his paw over the brim. Kristofferson hesitates. Ash
          raises an eyebrow and says mysterriously:

                         ASH
          Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's famous
          nutmeg-ginger-apple snaps?

          EXT. CAMP. DAY

          A large fire truck drives up to the destroyed hill with
          firemen hanging off the back and sides. It parks among the
          tractors and tents. The chief, in a white helmet, goes over
          to Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting at the mouth of the pit. A
          patch on his sleeve says O.W.F.R.P.F. Farmhands and firemen
          circle around.

                         CHIEF
          Who's got me a donation for the old
          Wounded Fireman's Retirement Pension
          Fund?
          Bean pulls a yellow check out of his inside pocket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         BEAN
          Right here.
          (pointing behind him)
          Let me show you this hole.

          INT. FLINT-MINE. DAY

          Candles glow all around. Everyone is seated at the long
          dining room table, and a magnificent feast with every variety
          of fruit, meat, vegetable, and roasted bird has been laid out
          in front of them. They tear into their meals, eating and
          drinking ferociously. Crumbs, juices, blood, and bones fly
          into the air. Jaws snap and chew. There is no conversation.
          Badger suddenly stands and rings a knife against his cider
          glass. Everyone looks up, taking a breather from the frenzy
          of eating. Badger clears his throat.

                         BADGER
          Well, it took a near-catastrophe for all
          of you to finally take me up on my offer
          to have you over to the flint-mine for
          dinner, but I guess we have --

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          I'm sorry. Maybe my invitation got lost
          in the mail. Does anybody know what this
          badger's talking about?
          Everyone laughs. Fox sits at the opposite end of the table
          with a crooked smile on his face.

                         FOX
          But Clive's right --

                         (STANDING UP)
          -- in all seriousness --
          (aside, to Badger)
          -- excuse me, B.
          Fox raises his cider glass. Badger reluctantly sits back
          down.

                         FOX
          I guess we do have those three ugly,
          cusshole farmers to thank for one thing:
          reminding us to be thankful and aware of
          each other. I'm going to say it again.

                         (GESTURING EXPANSIVELY)
          Aware.
          Badger whispers to his wife:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         BADGER
          Foxy cuss-blocked my toast, man.

                         CUT TO:
          The hole where Fox's tree once stood. The dead tree lies on
          its side. A fireman slides a thick hose deep into the tunnel.
          He looks behind him and nods.

                         FIREMAN #1
          Ready.
          The shot moves backwards along the hose, past seven more
          firemen signalling to each other with: a thumbs-up, a snap, a
          fist in the air, a swirl of the fingers, a peace symbol, an A-
          OK, and a hook-'em Horns. The shot continues past Boggis,
          Bunce, and Bean helping to hold the hose in position. Boggis
          growls. Bunce hisses. Bean snarls. The shot arrives at a pump
          on the side of the fire truck. The chief points:

                         CHIEF
          Let her rip.
          A fireman cranks a huge wrench on a steel nut. A pressure
          gauge shoots to maximum. The fire truck and hose begin to
          vibrate loudly.

                         CUT TO:
          Ash and Kristofferson crouched under a drain-cover pushed
          just-open next to a refrigerator. They peer out across a
          bright, clean, white kitchen at a plate of perfect, golden
          cookies on a counter-top next to an open window with a step-
          ladder directly in front of it. They look at each other. They
          look around the quiet, empty room. Ash shrugs.
          Ash and Kristofferson dart out, leaving the drain-cover
          propped-up. They race over the linoleum. They climb the step-
          ladder and stop at the plate. Ash swoons and says

                         RAPTUROUSLY:

                         ASH
          They're still warm.
          Ash and Kristofferson gather more cookies than they can
          possibly carry, eating as they collect them. Crumbs go
          everywhere.
          On the other side of the room, the drain-cover falls shut
          with a loud clank. Ash and Kristofferson look up, wildly
          startled. All at once they hear in a simultaneous cacophony:
          the back door bursting open, a boy and two beagles shouting
          and barking, the pantry door slamming, Mrs. Bean and her

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          middle-aged housekeeper clanging pots and pans and arguing, a
          timer on the counter-top ringing, and a raven fluttering to
          the windowsill and cawing.
          Ash and Kristofferson panic silently. They drop the cookies
          and fly down the step-ladder.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox in mid-toast:

                         FOX
          I've stepped on some toes and alienated a
          few of you over the past few days -- but
          is it wrong for me to suggest we might've
          done worse than having an incredible
          banquet in a beautiful flint-mine
          surrounded by our favorite animals? Look
          at each other. Here we are. Wow. Now I've
          already had too much to drink, and I'm
          feeling sentimental, but I'm going to say
          something, anyway, which nobody wants to
          admit, but I think is probably true: we
          beat 'em. We beat those farmers, and now
          we're triumphantly eating their roasted
          chicken, their sizzling duck, their
          succulent turkey, their foie gras de --

                         (SUDDENLY)
          Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson?
          (to Mrs. Fox)
          What am I hearing again, baby? What's
          happening? Am I still paranoid?
          There is a low, distant rumbling which rapidly builds to a
          deafening roar. Everyone waits, frozen. A single drop of
          water drips from the ceiling into Badger's water glass. Fox
          turns to Badger and says:

                         FOX
          Let's pause again.
          A wild deluge smashes into the room flooding the flint-mine
          and tunnels with a blasting current that sweeps everyone and
          everything away chaotically.

                         CUT TO:
          The entire party of well-dressed animals and their plates,
          furniture, chickens, etc. shooting down the tunnel with the
          rushing waters. Fox, helpless, holding his breath, looks to
          the others underwater: Badger shakes his head in disgust;
          Rabbit makes a fierce grimace; Mole bares his teeth
          ferociously; Beaver rants angrily with bubbles coming out off
          his mouth; and Kylie stares ahead vacantly, holding his nose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          Fox turns sadly to Mrs. Fox. She looks terrified.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT

          The flood blasts out of a wide pipe rocketing the animals
          into a murky, brick cavern with drainpipes on all sides and
          three inches of black water on its floor. Fox picks himself
          up, dazed and scared, and looks around at his soaked friends
          and their families.

                         FOX
          What the cuss just happened? Something
          with water. That was dangerous. Is anyone
          hurt?

                         BADGER

                         (FURIOUS )
          We're all hurt! My entire flint-mine just
          got demolished!

                         FOX
          Let's do a head-count! Everybody pick a
          buddy!
          Each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their buddy
          relationship. Fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart
          about, searching. He shouts:

                         FOX
          Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson?
          Ash's voice cracks on the other side of the cavern:

                         ASH
          I'm here.
          Everyone turns to see Ash standing at the mouth of a smaller
          pipe. He looks devastated and terrified. Fox points to him.

                         FOX
          Ash! Who's your buddy?

                         ASH
          Kristofferson, but I lost him.

                         FOX
          You lost him? Where were you?

                         ASH
          We went for cookies.
          Everyone turns to Fox. Fox yells desperately:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         FOX
          Kristofferson!
          Fox sprints around the cavern, splashing, digging, and
          ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join his frantic
          search. His voice sounds pained as he shouts:

                         FOX
          Kristofferson! Kristofferson!
          Kristofferson!

                         CUT TO:
          The three farmers standing next to the fire truck. Bean holds
          a soaked, half-conscious Kristofferson up in the air by the
          tail. Kristofferson is quietly crying.

                         BEAN
          Wrap this wet, little mutt in a newspaper
          and put him in a box with some holes
          punched in the top.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT

          Everyone has gathered together. They are all in a state of
          shock. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox beside him.

                         FOX
          Your brother's going to kill me, if he
          survives his double-pneumonia.
          Beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a drainpipe,

                         SHOUTING:

                         BEAVER
          There's only one way out of this sewer,
          but the manhole cover's closed, and
          there's a station-wagon parked on it --
          which means we're permanently stuck down
          here.

                         BADGER

                         (BITTERLY)
          You still think we beat 'em, Foxy?
          Everyone turns to Fox and stares at him coldly. Fox sits down
          on the floor, in the water. He says quietly:

                         FOX
          Somebody take over. I'm not in charge
          anymore.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          Everyone looks around at each other. They don't know what to
          do. Mrs. Fox sits down in the water next to Fox.

                         FOX
          You told me to change, but I can't --

                         (REALIZING)
          -- except, possibly, on some level, I
          think I just did.

          MRS. FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          Well, then maybe we're not all going to
          die.
          Fox looks to Mrs. Fox. He stands up suddenly. He takes Mrs.
          Fox's hand.

                         FOX
          Excuse us, everyone.
          Fox leads Mrs. Fox over to a ledge near a cement waterfall on
          the far side of the brick cavern. He puts his arm around her
          waist.

                         FOX
          Badger's right. These farmers aren't
          going to quit until they catch me. I
          shouldn't have lied to your face. I
          shouldn't have resigned slash gotten
          fired from the Gazette. I shouldn't have
          pushed these farmers so far and tried to
          embarrass them and cuss with their heads.
          I enjoyed it, but I shouldn't have done
          it -- and now there's only one way out.
          Maybe if I hand myself over and let them
          kill me, stuff me, and hang me over their

                         MANTELPIECE --

          MRS. FOX

                         (ICILY)
          You'll do no such thing.

                         FOX

                         (QUIETLY)
          Darling, maybe they'll let everyone else
          live.
          Mrs. Fox stares at Fox. She says desolately:

          MRS. FOX
          Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         FOX
          I don't know, but I have a possible
          theory. I think I have this thing where I
          need everybody to think I'm the greatest
          -- the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox --
          and if they aren't completely knocked-
          out, dazzled, and kind of intimidated by
          me, then I don't feel good about myself.
          Mrs. Fox shakes her head and turns away. Fox continues:

                         FOX
          Foxes traditionally like to court danger,
          hunt prey, and outsmart predators -- and
          that's what I'm actually good at! I
          think, at the end of the day, I'm just --

          MRS. FOX

                         (QUIETLY)
          We're wild animals.
          Fox smiles sadly and nods. He shrugs.

                         FOX
          I guess we always were. I promise you: if
          I had all this to do over again, I'd have
          never let you down. It was always more
          fun when we did it together, anyway.
          Mrs. Fox has tears all over her face. Fox kisses her. He
          whispers in her ear:

                         FOX
          I love you, Felicity.

          MRS. FOX
          I love you, too, but I shouldn't have
          married you.
          Mrs. Fox turns and walks away. Fox stares after her. He goes
          over to Ash.

                         FOX
          Did I ever tell you about the time I
          learned we were going to have a cub?

                         ASH
          In the fox-trap.

                         FOX
          Right. We were at gun-point, and your

                         MOTHER --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         ASH
          -- says she's pregnant.

                         FOX
          Let me tell it, OK? I had no idea how we
          were going to get out of this jam, and
          then it hit me: what do foxes do better
          than any other animal?

                         ASH
          Dig.

                         FOX
          You're stepping on my lines.

                         ASH
          Keep telling it.

                         FOX
          So we dug. And the whole time I put paw
          over paw, scooping dirt and pebbles with
          your mother digging like crazy beside me,
          I kept wondering: who is this little boy
          going to be?

                         ASH
          Or girl.

                         FOX
           Or girl, right -- because at that point
           we didn't know.
          Fox grabs Ash by his shoulders and looks him in the eye.

                          FOX
           Ash, I'm so glad he was you.
          Fox hugs Ash tightly, holds him for an instant, then let's
          go. He turns to the group.

                         FOX
          Badger, organize a search party and try
          to find Kristofferson. Maybe he's alive.
          I'm sorry, everyone. I wish --

                         (HESITATES)
          Well, good-bye.
          Fox looks across the cavern to Mrs. Fox standing with her
          back to him. She turns to face him. Her eyes are burning. Fox
          smiles sadly. He races away down the drain-pipe. Everyone
          watches him disappear. Badger hesitates. He addresses the

                         GROUP UNCERTAINLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         BADGER
          I guess we should probably split into a
          certain number of groups and start doing
          something, right?

          INT. CONDUIT. NIGHT

          Fox sprints full-speed in the darkness. His claws scratch
          rattling along the iron floor and splash through puddles of
          shallow water.
          Fox stops suddenly. He stands up tall on his hind legs. His
          ears perk up. One pins back. He listens.

                         CUT TO:
          Badger carrying a lantern leading Ash, Mole, and two small
          rabbits down a drainpipe. Badger calls out:

                         BADGER
          Kristofferson? Hello? Can you hear us?
          Rat's voice echoes in the darkness:

                         RAT
          Y'all lookin' for somethin'? Nothin' down
          here but rusty bottle-caps and drainin'
          water.
          Everyone stops short. Rat drops into the pipe from an
          overhead drain ahead of them. He says ominously:

                         RAT
          They got the boy.

                         BADGER

                         (FROZEN)
          Who's got him?

                         RAT
          The farmers three. You know who I'm
          talkin' about.

                         BADGER

                         (HESITATES)
          They've kidnapped him?

                         RAT
          Well-done, Mr. Badger. You're a smart
          man. They want to trade the son for his
          poppa.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Rat flicks a folded letter through the air. Badger catches
          it. He opens it. Kylie looks over his shoulder. Badger
          frowns.

                         BADGER
          Why'd they write this in letters cut out
          of magazines?

                         KYLIE
          To protect their identities.
          (on second thought)
          Oh, right, but then why'd they sign their
          names? Plus, we already knew who they
          were because they're trying to kill us.

                         INSERT:
          A ransom note written in letters cut out of magazines and
          pasted onto a piece of paper. Badger reads out loud:
          Mr. Fox, we have your son. If you
          ever want to see him alive again --
          Ash calls out:

                         ASH
          I'm his son.
          Everyone looks at Ash. He stands behind them in silhouette.
          Rat says darkly:

                         RAT
          I can see the resemblance.
          Pause. In an instant, Rat grabs Ash by the tail, picks him up
          off the ground, swings him in the air, and flings him away
          twenty feet down the drainpipe. Badger looks stunned.
          Ash sits in a puddle in a stupor. Rat races toward him down
          the tunnel. He leaps into the air with his claws out and his
          teeth bared. As he is about to seize upon Ash -- he is
          suddenly jerked backwards and spun around.
          Rat is face to face with Fox. Fox strikes his old-fashioned
          boxing stance. He draws back and throws a hard punch, nailing
          Rat square in the jaw. Rat staggers, stunned. He swings his
          switchblade, cutting Fox across the chest.
          Fox touches the wound and looks at the blood on the fingers
          of his paw. He looks to Rat. Rat holds up his wrist and shows
          Fox a child's plastic digital watch with miniature footballs,
          baseballs, and soccer balls on it. He says strangely:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         RAT
          I've still got it.

                         FOX

                         (FROWNING)
          What'd you just say?

                         RAT
          I said I've still got the watch, Mr. Fox.
          She never asked for it back.
          A frozen moment. Fox springs forward and clamps his jaws onto
          Rat's throat. Rat tumbles over backwards. Fox pins him to the
          ground with his teeth in Rat's neck. Rat kicks and bucks and
          struggles, but Fox holds him fast. Rat goes limp. Fox
          releases him.
          Everyone slowly gathers around Fox and Rat. Ash kneels next
          to his father. Fox cradles Rat in his arms. Rat whispers:

                         RAT
          The boy's locked in an apple crate on top
          of a gun-locker in the attic of Bean
          Annex. It's a set-up.

                         FOX

                         (SADLY)
          Would you have told me if I didn't kill
          you first?
          Rat smiles sickly. Blood drips from his mouth. His voice

                         CREAKS:

                         RAT
          Never.

                         FOX
          (shaking his head)
          All these wasted years. What were you
          looking for, Rat?
          Fox wipes the blood from Rat's chin. Rat mutters.

                         ASH
          He's trying to say something, Dad.
          Fox leans his ear close to Rat's mouth. As quiet as a mouse,

                         RAT WHISPERS:

                         RAT
          Cider.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.
          Fox nods. He looks around the drainpipe. He cups his paw into
          the pool of murky water and holds it to Rat's lips.

                         FOX
          Here you are, Rat. A beaker of Bean's
          finest secret cider.
          Rat's slivery, scratchity, long, pink tongue laps up a taste
          of the black liquid. He licks his lips and says faintly:

                         RAT
          Like melted gold.
          Rat's eyes turn into X's. He is dead. Ash stands up.

                         ASH
          He redeemed himself.

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          Redemption? Sure.
          Fox swallows and says hopelessly with tears in his eyes:

                         FOX
          But, in the end -- he's just another dead
          rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese
          restaurant.
          Ash puts his hand on Fox's shoulder. Fox lays Rat gently onto
          the sewer floor. He stands up and turns to the rest of the
          group. Badger claps his paws together.

                         BADGER
          Well, I suppose we should --

                         FOX

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          Excuse me, again, B. The search party's
          been cancelled. We're replacing it with a
          go-for-broke rescue mission. It's a set-
          up, but maybe we can make it work. You
          two little rabbits run tell the others.

                         (YELLING)
          Now, go!
          The two little rabbits scurry away down the drainpipe. Badger
          walks with Fox and Ash.

                         BADGER
          What was he saying about that wristwatch?
          I didn't get what he was talking about.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          Fox hesitates. He shrugs and says with a sad nostalgia:

                         FOX
          Just some old back-story.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT

          The entire community of animals has reconnoitered in the
          brick cavern. Fox stands on a large spigot and addresses the
          group. He has a bandage on his chest.

                         FOX
          In a way, I'm almost glad that flood
          interrupted us, because I don't like the
          toast I was giving. I'm going to start
          over.
          Fox pantomimes raising a long-stemmed glass.

                         FOX
          When I look down this table with the
          exquisite feast set before us, I see: two
          terrific lawyers, a skilled pediatrician,
          a wonderful chef, a savvy real-estate
          agent, an excellent tailor, a crack
          accountant, a gifted musician, a pretty
          good minnow fisherman, and possibly the
          best landscape painter working on the
          scene today.
          As Fox describes them, the shot cuts to: Badger and Beaver;
          Mrs. Badger; Rabbit; Weasel; an especially small, waifish
          field mouse; Mole; Kylie (who looks slightly offended); and
          Mrs. Fox, respectively.

          Maybe a few of you might even read my
          column from time to time. Who knows? I
          tend to doubt it.

                         (DRAMATIC PAUSE)
          I also see a room full of wild animals.
          Everyone stares at Fox curiously, skeptical but intrigued.
          Fox points at them:

                         FOX
          Wild animals with true natures and pure
          talents. Wild animals with scientific-
          sounding Latin names that mean something

          his own strengths and weaknesses due to

          Anyway, I think it may very well be all
          the beautiful differences among us that
          just might give us the tiniest glimmer of
          a chance of saving my nephew and letting
          me make it up to you for getting us into
          this crazy whatever-it-is. I don't know.
          It's just a thought. Thank you for
          listening. Cheers, everyone.
          Fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking
          it. A few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking. Fox
          finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor.
          He makes a smashing-glass sound. Kylie shouts:

                         KYLIE
          Let's eat!
          Everyone turns to Kylie uncertainly. Kylie hesitates.

                         KYLIE
          What? I'm just playing along with the --

          Pause. Badger points to his otter secretary. She is Linda.
          Fox darts over to her and grips her by the arm.

          Linda! Lutra Lutra! You got some dry

          The field mouse shoves his way to the front of the crowd. He
          makes a fist with his paw.

          Kylie tugs at Fox's sleeve. Fox turns to look at him. Kylie

                         SAYS SHYLY:

                         KYLIE
          I didn't get a job yet -- or a Latin
          name. What's my strength?
          Fox raises an eyebrow. He thinks of something:

          Listen, you're Kylie. You're an
          unbelievably nice guy. Your job is really
          just to... be available, I think. I don't
          know your Latin name. I doubt they even
          had opossums in ancient Rome.
          Kylie puts his hands in his pockets and scowls.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT

          Mrs. Fox puts the finishing touches on a vast mural painted
          on the longest, tallest wall of the brick cavern. She stands
          on a ladder. Her sleeves are rolled up, and she is splattered
          with twelve different colors of paint. She looks down to Fox
          standing below with an entourage of Kylie, Badger, Linda, and
          Rickity. The animal children mop and scrub in the background.
          Ash stands leaning against a push-broom watching his parents.
          Fox surveys the mural. It is highly detailed, filled with the
          textures of the landscape, and decorated with images of
          flowers, leaves, acorns, etc. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox
          opens his arms wide and shouts:

                         FOX
          It's stupendous. Where's us?

          MRS. FOX
          (pointing to a spot)
          Right here.

          The bottom of the map. Mrs. Fox's paw paints a red X and puts
          a circle around it.
          The shot zooms out to reveal the entire valley -- no longer a
          painting on the brick wall. Lighting strikes at the horizon.
          Dark clouds loom over the three farmers' compounds. It looks
          exactly like one of Mrs. Fox's paintings of a landscape in a
          rainstorm. Bean's helicopter circles the area.

          EXT. HILL. NIGHT

          A bicycle messenger with a head-lamp rings his bell as he
          approaches the farmers' camp. He stops in front of Bean and
          hands him an envelope. Bean tears it open and unfolds the
          letter inside.

                         INSERT:

          A note written in letters cut out of magazines and pasted
          onto a piece of paper. It reads:
          Dear Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean,
          I have no alternative but to agree to
          your terms. Move the station wagon and
          open the manhole cover below the foot of
          the drainpipe next to the cobbler's shop
          and meet me there today at 10 A.M. sharp.
          I will hand myself over to you in
          exchange for the boy's safe return.
          Cordially,
          Mr. Fox
          Bean frowns. He studies the letter. He shows it to Boggis and
          Bunce.

                         BEAN
          Why'd he write this in letters cut out of
          magazines?

                         BUNCE

                         (SHRUGS)
          I don't know, but you did the same thing.

                         BEAN

                         (UNEASY)
          I don't trust this guy. Anyway, set up
          the ambush.

          INT. ATTIC. DAY

          The top floor of Bean Annex. The room is filled with boxes of
          Christmas ornaments, old sports equipment, two stained
          mattresses, and a broken birdcage. Cobwebs hang from the
          rafters below the sloped roof.
          Kristofferson stands with his hands in his pockets looking
          out between the slats from inside a padlocked apple crate on
          top of a gun locker in the corner. He clears his throat. He
          calls out politely:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Could I have a cup of water, please?
          Kristofferson waits for a reply, but no one answers. He
          whistles to himself for a minute. He clears his throat again.
          He calls out:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Excuse me! Excuse me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          Silence.

          INT. DRAINPIPE. DAY

          A cement conduit with an iron grating above it. A fast stream
          of sewer water runs along its side. Fox walks briskly down
          the pipe followed by his entourage and Ash. Their steps echo
          loudly.

                         FOX
          Synchronize your clocks. The time is

                         NOW --
          Fox looks at his wrist. He is wearing Rat's plastic, digital,
          sports-themed wristwatch.

                         FOX
          -- nine forty-five A.M.
          Everyone checks their watches. Badger points at Fox's wrist.

                         BADGER
          Is that Rat's watch?

                         FOX

                         (VAGUELY)
          No. Originally, no.

                         (PAUSE)
          Well, OK, here's the back-story: when I
          was a teenager I spent a summer working
          as a bar-back at a jazz pub called
          Django's where Rat played horn down
          near -- can I tell this another time? We
          should stay focused on what's happening
          right now.
          Ash comes up to Fox's side and says discreetly:

                         ASH
          I should probably ride with you and Kylie
          since it's my fault Kristofferson got
          captured stealing those nutmeg-ginger-
          apple snaps.

                         FOX

                         (PUZZLED)
          I didn't understand a word of that
          sentence, but none of it matters, anyway,
          because it's too dangerous for you to
          come with us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          An old craftsman looks out from the window of Ferguson
          Cobblers as he taps little nails into the heel of a loafer. A
          station-wagon with wood-grain side-panels and a flat tire
          sits parked on a manhole cover in front of the shop. Boggis,
          Bunce, and five armed farmhands watch as Bean monkeys with a
          slim-jim until he gets the car door jimmied.
          Bean hops inside. He starts the engine, puts his arm over the
          top of the seat as he looks back out the rear window, and
          throws the station-wagon into reverse. The farmers clear out
          of the way as Bean backs up off the manhole cover.
          Boggis and Bunce stick tools into the manhole cover and lift
          it open.

                         INSERT:
          Rat's watch. It is now 10 A.M.

                         CUT TO:
          Six armed farmhands on the roof of the Nag's Head Tavern.

                         CUT TO:
          Seven armed farmhands in the bushes behind Sweetings Bakery.

                         CUT TO:
          Eight armed farmers in the window of Harrison Travel.

                         CUT TO:
          The Action 13 reporter and camera crew in an alley next to
           St. John's Coin-op Laundry.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean crouch behind the open doors of a
          pick-up truck with three beagles. Boggis checks his carbine.
          Bunce loads his shotgun. Bean cocks his Luger. Fox's voice
          hollers from deep inside the manhole:

          FOX (O.S.)
          Did you bring the boy?

                         BEAN
          Of course, we did! Say something, kid!
          Bunce presses play on a tape recorder. Kristofferson's voice
          comes over a loudspeaker:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         KRISTOFFERSON'S VOICE
          Excuse me! Excuse me?
          Bunce presses stop.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and his entourage at the bottom off the manhole. Fox
          scoffs. He smiles and shakes his head.

                         FOX
          Come on! That doesn't sound anything like
          him! It's amateur night in Dixie!
          Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together. A bit
          chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on some
          kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          A ribbon of white smoke rises out of the manhole. The three
          farmers watch curiously as it thickens and turns black. Bean
          frowns.

                         BEAN
          What the cuss is he burning?
          A blazing pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies
          through the air, over the farmers' heads. It lands in a trash
          can and lights some rubbish on fire. A man with a dart in one
          hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the Nag's
          Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes
          out.
          The three farmers laugh smugly. Bean shouts:

                         BEAN
          Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox?
          Twenty-seven blazing pinecones shoot out of the manhole and
          hit: a wood-pile on the roof of the Nag's Head, a box of
          pastry wrappers in the bushes behind Sweetings, a stack of
          brochures in the window of Harrison Travel, a hay bale in the
          bed of the pick-up truck, Boggis, Bunce, Bean, and a crate of
          cam-corder batteries next to the Action 13 camera crew, which
          explodes. Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and
          tamping out the flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and
          scramble in the confusion.
          Rabbit darts out of the hole and races up the street. Six
          farmers chase after him, firing their weapons.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. DAY

          Down in the brick cavern, Mole listens to a tin can attached
          to a string. He says urgently as he makes notations in a

                         LEDGER:

                         MOLE
          Twenty-eight pinecones fired! Twenty-two
          targets hit!
          Mrs. Fox, standing on her ladder, paints black checks quickly
          on the street in her mural. The stolen, portable television
          set sits in the corner, tuned into Action 13's coverage of
          the chaos in the street.

                         CUT TO:
          Rabbit running full-steam out of the village being pursued by
          the six farmhands. He hurdles an empty Coke bottle lying on
          its side in the road.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          Badger jumps out of the manhole and throws more blazing
          pinecones at farmers, trucks, parked cars, doors, windows,
          and the Action 13 camera crew. Seven farmhands chase him down
          a cobblestone lane.
          Weasel and Beaver climb out with straws in their paws and
          start firing blueberries toward the disoriented beagles. The
          beagles eat blueberries. They fall over. Eight farmhands
          chase Weasel and Beaver up a wooded path.
          Rickity, the field mouse, bounds out of the hole and leaps
          into the fracas. He fires a rubber band at Bunce off a
          paperclip. It snaps Bunce in the corner of his eye. Rickity
          lets out a little whoop.
          There is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from
          the manhole. Fox and Kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle
          with a tarp over it parked in front of Paddington Automotive.
          Fox whips off the tarp, revealing a miniature motorcycle with
          a sidecar.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox driving the motorcycle with Kylie in the sidecar. They
          both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the
          distance. Kylie sinks lower in the sidecar. He shouts to Fox
          over the sound of the motor:

                         KYLIE
          Are you scared of wolves?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         FOX
          Scared, no! I have a phobia of them!

                         KYLIE
          Well, I have a thing about thunder!

                         FOX

                         (ANNOYED)
          Why? That's stupid!
          Ash pokes his head up from the rear compartment of the
          sidecar. He also wears a helmet and goggles. His white cape
          flutters behind him. He shouts:

                         ASH
          I don't like needles!
          Fox and Kylie look to Ash in disbelief. Fox says furiously:

                         FOX
          Where'd you come from again? How'd you
          get in the sidecar? I feel like I'm
          losing my mind!
          Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it
          slightly and fly over a little ditch. Ash yelps
          enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road.

          INT. HELICOPTER. DAY

          A pilot with a red moustache and a South African accent flies
          Bean's chopper. He wears a Bean, inc. patch on his shoulder.
          He shouts into the microphone connected to his helmet:

                         PILOT
          I've got a fox on a motorcycle with a
          littler fox and what looks to be an
          opossum in the sidecar riding north on
          farm lane seven. Does that sound like
          anything to anybody?
          A military-type voice responds over the radio:

          MILITARY VOICE (O.S.)
          Roger that, Red. Let me just, uh -- Oh, I
          think the boss wants to --

          BEAN (0.S.)
          Red, it's Franklin Bean! Turn around, get
          the cuss back here, and pick us up on the

          A.S.A.P!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

          EXT. BEAN'S COMPOUND. DAY

          The Bean, inc. windmill spins briskly in the dusty winds.
          Shutters on the farmhouse bang open and shut. Leaves rustle
          on the branches of the apple trees. A few stray turkeys
          wander in the yard. A white-washed brick pile six stories
          tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its
          courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean
          Annex.
          The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters
          vegetables next to the driveway. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look out
          from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed-wire
          security barricade.

                         FOX
          That's the annex over there on the right.
          Ash nods. Kylie does not respond.

                         FOX
          The white building over there on the
          right.
          Pause. Fox looks to Kylie.

                         FOX
          Kylie?
          Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him vacantly. Fox says

                         SHARPLY:

                         FOX
          Kylie!

                         KYLIE
          What?

                         (SUDDENLY)
          I did it!

                         FOX
          When? I didn't see it!
          Kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw. The gardener
          puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his
          bicycle.
          Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come
          out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the
          gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park
          outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the
          motorcycle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          Fox climbs onto Kylie's shoulders and tries the knobs. They
          are locked.

                         FOX
          Kylie, you got a credit card?

                         KYLIE
          (digging in his pockets)
          Sure.

                         FOX

                         (IMPRESSED)
          See, this is what I was saying about how
          good you are at just being available for

                         WHATEVER --
          Kylie hands Fox a World Traveler Titanium Card. Fox frowns.

                         FOX
          A Titanium Card? How the cuss did you
          qualify for this?

                         KYLIE

                         (SHRUGS)
          I pay my bills on time. I've always had
          good credit.
          Fox examines the card with mild resentment. He picks the lock
          and opens the doors.
          The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side,
          there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a
          compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted,
          broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest,
          fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle.
          White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily.
          Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck
          reads Spitz.
          Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens
          his eyes. Fox turns to Kylie.

                         FOX
          Give me a blueberry.
          Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and
          gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his
          hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points
          at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away
          and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly:

                         ASH
          What's that white stuff around his mouth?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         KYLIE

                         (SQUINTING)
          I think he eats soap.
          Fox sees an amber, plastic pharmacy bottle on a shelf above
          some bags of fertilizer. It's reads:
          Drug: Phenomoxylcarbobubytol, 10 mg

                         NAME: SPITZ

                         BREED: BEAGLE
          For: RABIES (chronic)
          Other: Take with meat, do not operate heavy machinery
          Fox frowns. He says grimly:

                         FOX
          That's not soap.

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Well, then why does he have that bubbly --

                         FOX
          He's rabid. With rabies. I've heard about
          this beagle.
          The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully:

                         FOX
          Easy, boy.
          Fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle. He holds out the
          back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He says back over
          his shoulder to Kylie and Ash:

                         FOX
          I'm going to try to befriend him. I feel
          like there's a tenderness in his eyes.
          Fox takes another step. He makes a soft, kissing noise. The
          beagle watches him calmly.

                         FOX
           Yes, I'm right. He's a good boy. A little
          lonely, maybe, but --
          Fox takes another cautious step.

                         FOX
          -- but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy.
          Is your name Spitz? That's German, isn't
          it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         KYLIE
          (aside, to Ash)
          I thought he said you never look a beagle
          in the eye.

                         FOX

                         (COAXINGLY)
          Why, you're just as sweet as a --
          Fox and the beagle lock eyes. The pupils of the beagle's eyes
          contract then completely disappear, and the whites turn
          bright red. Fox's eyes open wider than their sockets.
          The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an
          enraged maniac. His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie,
          and Ash shriek and scream, sprinting frantically around the
          courtyard as the rabid beagle, frothing, roaring, and
          snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox shouts, his
          voice cracking like a grandmother's:

                         FOX
          Climb the trellis!
          In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis
          six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping
          off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof
          of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a
          pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look
          down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane
          fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the
          courtyard.
          Fox takes in their new surroundings. He says, pleased:

                         FOX
          So the attic is probably in the area
          right up around here somewhere, I figure,
          huh?
          Kylie and Ash, panting and dripping with sweat, both stare at
          Fox vacantly.
          (NOTE: a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating Kylie's
          vacant look will be used for Ash in this shot.)

                         FOX

                         (IRRITATED)
          Come on, guys. Stay with me. We did good.
          That's just some dog. Let's not get
          traumatized.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          EXT. ROOF. DAY

          Bean's helicopter lands on top of the Nag's Head. Fires
          smolder and farmers continue to chase around after animals in
          the village streets below. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, leaning
          over and holding onto their hats, run to the chopper and
          climb inside. They take off.

                         CUT TO:
          The street below. An orange and yellow Citroen van screeches
          into the melee. Painted yellow letters spell Badoit et Fils,
          Destruction des Animaux Nuisibles on the side of it with an
          image of a trapped fox.
          An old man with a grey moustache and a young man with a black
          moustache, both dressed in orange-and-yellow-striped
          uniforms, jump out of the van. They open the side door and
          start unloading stacks of metal cages.

                         CUT TO:
          Rabbit still running full-steam down a country lane being
          pursued by the six farmhands.

          INT. ATTIC. DAY

          Kristofferson stands inside the apple crate leaning against
          the wall with his legs crossed and one arm akimbo with his
          hand on his hip. There is a clanking sound from above.
          Kristofferson looks up.
          A trap door in the ceiling creaks open. Fox, Kylie, and Ash
          look inside, down at Kristofferson. Kristofferson smiles
          oddly and says in a surprised, fancy-meeting-you-here voice:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Hi!

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie lowering Ash into the room with three different-
          colored shoelaces tied together and belted around his waist.
          Ash holds the shoelace and keeps a paw behind his back like a
          mountaineer. His feet touch down on the shelf. He runs to the
          apple crate and jiggles the padlock. He hesitates. He says

                         SUDDENLY:

                         ASH
          Can I get one of those karate lessons
          real quick?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         KRISTOFFERSON

                         (LONG PAUSE)
          OK. Normally, we start with some
          breathing exercises and such. Stand like
          this.
          Kristofferson stands with his paws clasped in front of him.
          Ash mimics this.

                         CUT TO:
          A fox-trap hanging from a chain suspended above the alley
          behind the Nag's Head Tavern. A second one hangs behind
          Sweetings Bakery. A third one hangs behind Harrison Travel. A
          fourth one hangs behind St. John's Coin-op Laundry. A fifth
          one hangs behind Ferguson Cobblers.
          Rickity curiously examines a little, hanging wire. He mutters

                         TO HIMSELF:

                         RICKITY
          Is this spring-loaded?

                         CUT TO:
          Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          This next part is mental. Position
          yourself on the balls of your feet.
          Kristofferson stands lightly poised with his arms out. Ash
          mimics this.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Close your eyes.
          Kristofferson closes his eyes. So does Ash. So do Fox and
          Kylie. Kristofferson says mystically:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          You weigh less than a slice of bread.

                         CUT TO:
          Each fox-trap in rapid succession as it falls on: Rickity,
          Badger, Weasel, and Beaver. The two small rabbits watch from
          a sewer-gutter drain under the street-curb. They panic. They
          race down a pipe, into a tunnel, and through a conduit.

                         CUT TO:
          Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Let's review the principle agility
          techniques: jumping, flipping, landing.

                         CUT TO:
          Mrs. Fox looking down from her ladder at the three, panting
          rabbits. She looks stunned. She motions to her mural/map and

                         SAYS:

          MRS. FOX
          Show me where they are!

                         CUT TO:
          The two small rabbits, Mrs. Rabbit, Mrs. Badger, Mole, and
          Mrs. Fox each furiously digging a new tunnel.

          KRISTOFFERSON (V.0.)
          Now for a rudimentary version of the
          cyclone chop.

                         CUT TO:
          Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          First, you need to get a running start,
          which, obviously, I can't do in here,
          then, as you arrive at the destination of
          the chop --

                         (DEMONSTRATING)
          -- lean and thrust into the point of
          contact, paw remains open and straight,
          then withdraw instantaneously. Remember,
          it's the pull-back that matters. The pull-

                         BACK --

                         (DEMONSTRATING)
          -- generates the force of the impact.

                         ASH

                         (IMMEDIATELY)
          Got it.
          Ash walks ten paces away to the far end of the shelf. Fox and
          Kylie watch from above. Kylie says excitedly:

                         KYLIE
          He's going to do it!
          Fox makes a face that says, I'm not so sure. Ash takes a deep
          breath. He screams at the top of his lungs as he sprints
          toward the apple crate:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         ASH
          Ki-ya!
          Ash's toe catches on a loose nail. He somersaults twice
          through the air and bounces off the side of the apple crate,
          which falls off the shelf.
          Kristofferson braces himself. The apple crate hits the floor
          and shatters into pieces. Kristofferson lies among the
          wreckage.
          Ash looks over the side of the shelf. Fox and Kylie watch
          from above, grimacing.

                         ASH
          I'm sorry.

                         KRISTOFFERSON

                         (DAZED)
          That's all right. You were just trying to
          unlock the apple crate.

                         ASH
          No, I mean I'm sorry about --

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          (picking himself up)
          Oh, you mean from before. The apology you
          owed me which you never actually said.

                         ASH
          Yeah.
          Kristofferson nods sadly. He takes a deep breath. He nods
          again.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          That's all right, too. Throw me the
          shoelace, please.
          Ash smiles.

                         CUT TO:
          Badger trapped in his cage. He hears something. He looks
          quickly down the alley. The old, orange van turns the corner
          and approaches, bumping over potholes. Badger shrinks into
          the corner of the cage and mutters grimly to himself:

                         BADGER
          Badoit et fils.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          A cobblestone beside Badger suddenly drops straight down and
          disappears into the ground. Badger recoils, scared and
          confused.
          Mrs. Fox pokes her head up through the hole. She is beaded
          with perspiration and breathes heavily. Her fur is wildly
          dishevelled. She looks to the van driving up the alley. She
          looks to Badger. She extends her paw to him and says

                         FIERCELY:

          MRS. FOX
          Let's go!

          EXT. YARD. DAY

          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson come around the side of
          the building. They run to their motorcycle, outside the
          courtyard doors. They freeze.
          The front gates to the compound are closed and bolted. Bean's
          helicopter waits on top of the vegetable garden with its
          rotar-blades whirling. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand in front
          of Bean Annex with their weapons drawn.
          Fox sees his tail around Bean's collar. His eyes narrow. His
          jaw sets. He says to himself with growing emotion:

                         FOX
          Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your
          posse hunted my family. Your gunmen
          kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my
          wife -- and you shot off my tail.

                         (STEELY)
          I'm not leaving here without that neck-
          tie.
          Bean smiles his sickly smile. Fox smiles back defiantly.
          Kylie looks utterly baffled. Ash says mystically:

                         ASH
          I weigh less than a slice of bread.

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          What?

                         ASH
          I'll be right back.
          Ash runs. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson watch, shocked, as
          Ash sprints back to the courtyard doors. The three farmers
          open fire at him. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson duck and take
          cover behind a hay-bale.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          Ash dodges bullets. He jumps off the balls of his feet with
          his arms out over a sprinkler-pipe and swings like a gymnast
          onto a clothesline, then flies through the air doing another
          of his spectacularly awkward four-armed and three-legged back-
          flips. He lands on the handle of one of the courtyard doors

                         AND SCREAMS:

                         ASH
          Ki-ya!
          Ash cyclone-chops the doorknob. The lock clicks. Ash's eyes
          light up.
          Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and burrows into the
          dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through his
          nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw
          hanging open.
          The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears
          out into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and
          thrashing crazily. The farmers shriek and scream and run
          around, panicking, with their guns blazing.
          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their
          motorcycle. The beagle rips the tail from Bean's neck, shreds
          it, chews it up, and swallows it. Fox deflates for an
          instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash on the back of the
          motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox's waist. He
          says with the deepest affection and respect:

                         FOX
          Ash, that was pure, wild animal
          craziness. You're an athlete.
          Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter.
          (NOTE: from this point onwards, an alternate version of Ash
          will be used which is slightly taller, slightly leaner, and
          animated slightly more gracefully.)
          Fox kick-starts the motorcycle and races across the farm.
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble onto the roof of a car port
          with an old, white Mercedes convertible under it. The
          snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as:
          Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the
          edge of the property. He guns the motor and yells:

                         FOX
          Holy swearing cuss!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Fox races the motorcycle up the apple cart, into the air, and
          over the concrete barricade. They land in the middle of the
          road, skidding, and speed off down the hill.

                         CUT TO:
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean watching from the roof of the car
          port. Boggis turns to Bean and says, deadpan, needling him:

                         BOGGIS
          Franklin? You got any final twist for
          this plot?

                         BEAN

                         (PAUSE)
          Yeah!
          Bean grabs Boggis by the neck and throttles him. Bunce starts
          throwing punches. Bean holds him back by the forehead. Boggis
          kicks Bunce in the stomach. They brawl chaotically while the
          rabid beagle continues to go bananas below them.

                         CUT TO:
          Each fox-trap with a cobblestone missing underneath it and a
          hole in the ground. The old man with the grey moustache turns
          to his son and says with a strong French accent:

                         BADOIT
          Cuss.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. DAY

          Mrs. Fox sits anxiously at the bottom of her ladder. Badger,
          Weasel, Rickity, the two small rabbits, and the others sit,
          exhausted, in the dark cavern, passing a jar of cider. Mole

                         INTERRUPTS:

                         MOLE
          Stand by!
          Everyone looks to Mole. Mole is holding the tin can with the
          string attached to it to his ear. He nods and says urgently:

                         MOLE
          I just intercepted a high-frequency radio
          signal with the can --
          (gestures with the tin can)
          -- and I think they're on their way home!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Mrs. Fox jumps up, embraces Mole, and kisses him on the
          snout. Mole blushes.

                         CUT TO:
          Rabbit still running full-steam back into the village being
          pursued by the six farmhands. He comes to the manhole where
          they started and darts into it. The six farmhands stop at the
          manhole and look down. They go straight to the Nag's Head,
          walk inside, and close the door behind them.

          EXT. ROAD. DAY

          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson ride down a country road.
          Kylie sees something across the meadow. He says warily:

                         KYLIE
          Don't turn around!

                         FOX
          What?
          Fox turns around. A huge, wild, grey wolf with ice-blue eyes
          stands on a rock fifty feet away from them. Fox slams on the
          brakes. The motorcycle slides to a halt.

                         FOX
          Where'd he come from?

                         (LOUDLY)
          Where'd you come from? What are you doing
          here?
          Pause. Fox points toward the wolf:

                         FOX
          Canis lupus!
          Fox points to himself:

                         FOX
          Vulpes Vulpes!
          The wolf does not answer. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson
          watch idling from the motorcycle.

                         FOX
          I don't think he speaks English or Latin.

                         (LOUDLY)
          Pensez-vous que 1'hiver sera rude?

                         (ASIDE)
          I'm asking if he thinks we're in for a
          hard winter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          The wolf shakes his head. Fox nods.

                         FOX
          He doesn't seem to know.
          Silence. Fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his

                         VOICE:

                         FOX
          I have a phobia of wolves!
          The wolf does not answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth
          open. Its teeth are long, sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs
          out, and its eyes are wild. Fox looks back at it with the
          identical expression for a minute, mesmerized -- then Fox
          closes his mouth and his eyes soften.
          Fox raises his paw in the air. The wolf blinks a few times.
          It raises its paw in the air. It turns away and trots off
          into the woods. Fox says wistfully:

                         FOX
          What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck,
          boys.
          Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning
          tires, and they tear off down the road. The shot booms down
          into the ground, below the grass, through buried pebbles,
          layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits.

                         TITLE:
          THREE DAYS LATER (2 1/2 Fox Weeks)
          The shot continues to descend past Badger and his family
          having dinner in a nicely furnished drain-pipe, past Rabbit
          and his family watching Magnum, P.I. on the stolen, portable
          television set in a well-appointed cement tunnel, past Beaver
          and Mrs. Beaver hosting Mole and Weasel for cocktails in a
          tasteful sewer-conduit.
          The shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to the brick
          cavern. The walls are filled with electrical cables, wires,
          pipes, and a large, new mural which depicts the Fox's former
          view of the valley as seen from their tree with a trompe
          1'oeil window-frame around it. It is signed Felicity Fox.
          Ash and Kristofferson sit Indian-style meditating on a
          braided rug. Mrs. Fox works mixing paints and turpentine at
          an easel in the corner. There is an armchair with a folded-up
          copy of the Gazette on its cushion in the center of the room
          under a glowing lamp. Classical music plays on a radio.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.
          Fox swings his head into the room from a tunnel. He says

                         GENTLY:

                         FOX
          My darlings?
          Everyone looks to Fox. He signals them to follow him.

          INT. DRAINPIPE. NIGHT

          The cement conduit with the iron grating above it. Fox and
          his family walk briskly down the pipe. A knitted, woolen,
          artificial tail has been sewn into the seat of Fox's
          trousers.

                         ASH
          Where are we going?

                         FOX
          Nobody knows.

                         ASH
          We were in the middle of a meditation
          practice.

                         FOX
          Watch your step.
          Fox takes everyone through an opening and starts climbing a
          metal ladder. He says theatrically:

                         FOX
          Let's see, now. Where does this lead?

          MRS. FOX
          Oh, no, Foxy. It's filthy.

                         FOX
          Keep a good grip, everyone.

                         ASH
          This better be worth it.

                         FOX
          I think I see a little sliver of light.
          What's this? Is that a door?

          MRS. FOX
          You're a terrible actor, Foxy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Do you smell something? Is that --

                         (SNIFFS TWICE)
          -- freon?

                         FOX
          Shh. I'm going to crack open this trap
          door and see if something's on the other
          side. I highly doubt it, though. There's
          probably just more sewer.
          Fox clears his throat. Pause.

                         FOX
          You know, wouldn't it be surprising if --

                         ASH
          Open it.
          Fox pushes open the trap door and crawls out. Everyone
          follows him.

          INT. SUPERMARKET. NIGHT

          Fox and his family stand in the middle of an aisle at the
          center of a large grocery store. To their left is the
          refrigerated section of milk, eggs, meat, fish, and cheese.
          To their right are canned goods, breakfast cereal, laundry
          detergent, rice, pasta, and condiments. The lights are half-
          dimmed, and a metal grate is closed over the front windows.
          There are no people. Fox says casually:

                         FOX
          Hey, look! There's a whole, enormous,
          glorious, gigantic supermarket up here!
          Ash and Kristofferson seem dumbstruck. Fox raises an eyebrow
          and smiles at Mrs. Fox. She puts her arm around his shoulder.

          MRS. FOX
          You really are kind of a quote-unquote
          fantastic fox.

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          I try. I guess now that Kristofferson's
          dad's already down to single-pneumonia
          and getting better, he'll be going home
          soon, huh?

          MRS. FOX
          Actually, when he spoke to me from the
          hospital, he said he was already talking

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          MRS. FOX (cont'd)
          to Weasel about real-estate availabil-
          ities down in our sewer system.

                         FOX
          Oh, really? Well, now's the time to buy.
          Kylie comes around the end of the aisle pushing a miniature
          shopping cart filled with jars of jelly, jam, olives,
          pickles, and honey, plus three loaves of bread, Band-Aids,
          toothpaste, and a carton of strawberry ice cream. He says

                         BRIGHTLY:

                         KYLIE
          Did I hear my name?

                         FOX

                         (SMILING)
          Not down here, you didn't.

                         KYLIE

                         (SMILING BLANKLY)
          Why not?

                         FOX
          Because we were talking about other
          things.

                         KYLIE

                         (RESIGNED)
          Oh, well.
          Fox looks at Ash, who is studying a twelve-pack of tropical
          juice punch-boxes.

                         FOX
          The white cape rather suits him, doesn't
          it? Actually, I had to do quite a bit of
          searching myself before I found a look
          that really flattered me. Remember those
          horseshoe cuff-links?
          Fox and Mrs. Fox crack-up laughing. Fox notices something and
          stops. He stares at Mrs. Fox strangely. She is glowing. She
          hesitates. She shrugs.

          MRS. FOX
          I'm pregnant again.
          Fox is confused and moved. He holds Mrs. Fox's face in his
          paws. She smiles. Ash interrupts:

                         ASH
          Dad?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox look to Ash. An empty punch-box lies on its
          side behind him with a straw sticking out of it. There is a
          huge, purple stain all over the front of his white shirt.

                         ASH
          Should we dance?
          Pause. Everyone breaks out giddily dancing an ecstatic jig.
          Kylie waltzes the cart in circles. Fox spins Mrs. Fox.

                         CUT TO:
          A wide shot of all sixteen aisles of the supermarket stacked
          with boxes, cartons, cans, bottles, bags, and jars of every
          possible variety of food. The family of foxes continues to
          dance at the distant end of the center aisle.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean sit silently in folding metal chairs
          around the manhole. Boggis's carbine rests across his lap.
          Bunce's shotgun hangs from a strap over his shoulder. Bean
          cleans his Luger. Petey sits on a cider box outside the Nag's
          Head strumming his guitar in the background. The bartender
          pulls the shutters shut and flips a sign on the door to
          Closed. Petey starts singing his song as the credits roll.
          The sun sets. The farmers sit waiting in the dark.

| Okay, this is the work-in-progress FINDING NEMO film transcript.  |
| Why is it 'work-in-progress' you might ask? Well for one, this    |
| isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    |
| may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     |
| spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    |
| where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   |
| makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    |
| 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   |
| of equal signs (=).                                               |
|                                                                   |
| This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have    |
| any. What you CAN'T do, however, is to edit it and take credit    |
| for it. Although I do not own the movie or it's screenplay, this |
| transcript was made with no intention of copyright infringement |

MARLIN
Wow.

CORAL
Mmm.

MARLIN
Wow.

CORAL
Mmm-hmm.

MARLIN
Wow.

CORAL
Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful.

MARLIN
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna
get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your
man deliver or did he deliver?


                                             1

CORAL
My man delivered.

MARLIN
And it wasn't so easy.

CORAL
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

MARLIN
You better believe they did--every single one of them.

CORAL
Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.

MARLIN
So, you do like it, don't you?

CORAL
No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?

MARLIN
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by
their bedroom window.

CORAL
Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.

MARLIN
Oh, right. Right.

CORAL
Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.

MARLIN
You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.

CORAL
I like Nemo.

MARLIN
Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

CORAL
Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!

MARLIN
Yeah. What if they don't like me?

CORAL
Marlin.

MARLIN
No, really.

CORAL
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.

CORAL
What?

MARLIN
You remember how we met?

CORAL
Well, I try not to.

MARLIN
Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'

CORAL
Marlin!

MARLIN

                                             2

'Well, you gotta look a little closer because it's wiggling'.

CORAL
Get away!

MARLIN
Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?

MARLIN
[gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get
inside, you, right now.

MARLIN
No!

MARLIN
Coral! Coral?

MARLIN
Coral? Oh!

MARLIN
Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will
never let anything happen to you...Nemo.

======================================================================================

NEMO
First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!

MARLIN
I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.

NEMO
Not you, dad. Me!

MARLIN
Okay...huh?

NEMO
Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!
It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!

MARLIN
All right, I'm up.

NEMO
Oh boy--whoa!

MARLIN
Nemo!

NEMO
First day of school!

MARLIN
[gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.
All right, where's the break? You feel a break?

NEMO
No.

MARLIN
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?

NEMO
No.

MARLIN
Are you woozy?

NEMO
No.

MARLIN
How many stripes do I have?


                                             3

NEMO
I'm fine.

MARLIN
Answer the stripe question!

NEMO
Three.

MARLIN
No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,
you're okay. How's the lucky fin?

NEMO
Lucky.

MARLIN
Let's see.

MARLIN
Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

NEMO
Come on, dad. It's time for school.

MARLIN
Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.

NEMO
Ohh...

MARLIN
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

NEMO
Yes.

MARLIN
Brush.

NEMO
Okay, I'm done.

MARLIN
You missed a spot.

NEMO
Where?

MARLIN
There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!

======================================================================================

MARLIN
All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?

NEMO
It's not safe.

MARLIN
That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,
if you wanna do it four times--

NEMO
Dad..

MARLIN
All right. Come on, boy.

NEMO
Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!

MARLIN

                                             4

I highly doubt that.

NEMO
Have you ever met a shark?

MARLIN
No, and I don't plan to.

NEMO
How old are sea turtles?

MARLIN
Sea turtles? I don't know.

NEMO
Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
a hundred years old!

MARLIN
Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,
hold my fin.

NEMO
Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

MARLIN
Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

FISH KIDS
Bye, mom!

FISH MOM
I'll pick you up after school.

CRAB KID
Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!

MARLIN
Come on, we'll try over there.

MARLIN
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

BOB
Well, look who's out of the anemone.

MARLIN
Yes. Shocking, I know.

BOB
Marty, right?

MARLIN
Marlin.

BOB
Bob.

TED
Ted.

BILL
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.

BOB/TED
Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.

MARLIN
Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
other fish.

BILL
Aw, come on, clownie.

TED
Yeah, do something funny.

                                             5

BOB
Yeah!

MARLIN
All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place
and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them   were walking, so forget that I--

BOB
Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!

KIDS
Whoa!

MR. JOHANSSEN
All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?

NEMO
Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?

MARLIN
I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

MARLIN
That's where I would play

PEARL
What's wrong with his fin?

TAD
He looks funny!

SHELDON
Ow! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?

BOB
Be nice. It's his first time at school.

MARLIN
He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.

NEMO
Dad.

PEARL
See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.

SHELDON
I'm H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]

TAD
I'm obnoxious.

MR. RAY
[singing] Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the
open sea.

KIDS
Mr. Ray!

SHELDON
Come on, Nemo.

MARLIN
Whoa, you better stay with me.

MR. RAY
[singing]..mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and
me to see.

MR. RAY
Huh, I wonder where my class has gone?

KIDS

                                               6

We're under here!

MR. RAY
Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so
lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.

NEMO
Dad, you can go now.

MR. RAY
Well, hello. Who is this?

NEMO
I'm Nemo.

MR. RAY
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

NEMO
Okay.

MR. RAY
You live in what kind of home?

NEMO
An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--

MR. RAY
Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!

MARLIN
Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.

NEMO
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

MR. RAY
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.

JIMMY
Aw, man!

MR. RAY
[singing]

MARLIN
Bye, Nemo!

NEMO
Bye, dad!

MARLIN
Bye, son! Be safe.

BOB
Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.

MARLIN
Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?

BILL
Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.

MARLIN
They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?

BOB
Hey, Marty. Calm down.

MARLIN
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!

BOB
'Pony boy'?

                                             7

BILL
You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

TED
Pity.

======================================================================================

MR. RAY
[singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species
that live in thesea.

NEMO
Whoa.

MR. RAY
[singing] There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come
on, sing with me. Oh...!

MR. RAY
Just the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food
with the rays of the sun...

MR. RAY
Okay, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps]
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.
There are as many protein pairs contained in this...

TAD
Come on, let's go.

MR. RAY
Come on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa,
ctenophora, bryozoas, three!

NEMO
Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.

TAD
Cool.

TAD
Saved your life!

PEARL
Aw, you guys made me ink.

NEMO
What's that?

TAD
I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
butt.

NEMO
Whoa.

PEARL
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

SHELDON
Oh, look at me. I'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa!

SHELDON
Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.

PEARL
Okay. Beat that.

TAD
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

NEMO
Uh, my dad says it's not safe.


                                             8

MARLIN
Nemo, no!

NEMO
Dad?

MARLIN
You were about to swim into open water!

NEMO
No, I wasn't go out--but dad!

MARLIN
It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--

PEARL
Sir, he wasn't gonna go.

TAD
Yeah, he was too afraid.

NEMO
No, I wasn't.

MARLIN
This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out
there.
You know you can't swim well.

NEMO
I can swim fine, dad, okay?

MARLIN
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.

NEMO
No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--

MARLIN
Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do
these
things but you just can't, Nemo!

NEMO
I hate you.

MR. RAY
There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a
scientist, sir. Is there any problem?

MARLIN
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little
too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

MR. RAY
Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

MARLINLook, I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost
from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking--

FISH KID
Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

MARLIN
Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get
you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one
move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

TAD
[whispering] He touched the butt.

MARLIN
You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...big--


                                             9

NEMO
Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!

MARLIN
I'm coming, Nemo!

KIDS
Aaaah!

MR. RAY
Get under me, kids!

NEMO
Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!

MARLIN
Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!

DIVER
Whoa! Hold on.

MARLIN
Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No!
Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!

MARLIN
Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!

DORY
Look out!

MARLIN
Waaaah!

MARLIN
Ooh, ooh...

DORY
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?

MARLIN
He's gone, he's gone..

DORY
There, there. It's all right.

MARLIN
He's gone.

DORY
It'll be okay.

MARLIN
No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.

DORY
Hey, I've seen a boat.

MARLIN
You have?

DORY
It passed by not too long ago.

MARLIN
A white one?

DORY
Hi. I'm Dory.

MARLIN
Where!? Which way!?

DORY
Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!

MARLIN

                                             10

Thank you! Thank you, thank you so much!

DORY
No problem.

MARLIN
Hey! Wait!

DORY
Will you quit it?

MARLIN
What?

DORY
I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?

MARLIN
Huh?

DORY
You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah,
oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?

MARLIN
Wait a minute..

DORY
Stop following me, okay!?

MARLIN
What? You're showing me which way the boat went!

DORY
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this
way. Follow me!

MARLIN
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat
was going!

DORY
I did? Oh dear...

MARLIN
If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!

DORY
No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

MARLIN
Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!

DORY
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?

MARLIN
Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]

BRUCE
Hello.

DORY
Well, hi!

BRUCE
Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of
bites like you doing out so late, eh?

MARLIN
Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.

BRUCE
Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?

DORY

                                             11

You mean like a party?

BRUCE
Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?

DORY
Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!

MARLIN
Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--

BRUCE
Oh, come on, I insist.

MARLIN
O-okay..that's all that matters.

DORY
Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!

BRUCE
Ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

BRUCE
Anchor! Chum!

ANCHOR
There you are, Bruce, finally!

BRUCE
We got company.

ANCHOR
It's about time, mate.

CHUM
We've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!

ANCHOR
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

CHUM
Come on, let's get this over with.

======================================================================================

BRUCE
Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
'I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must
first change myself. Fish are friends, not food'.

ANCHOR
Except stinkin' dolphins.

CHUM
Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're sooo cute! 'Hey, look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin!
Let me flip for 'ya! Ain't I a somethin'!'

BRUCE
Right, then. Today's meeting is step 5, 'BRING A FISH FRIEND'. Now do you all have your
friends?

ANCHOR
Got mine.

DORY
Hey there!

BRUCE
How 'bout you, Chum?

CHUM
Oh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.


                                             12

BRUCE
That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself
to one of my friends.

CHUM
Oh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?

BRUCE
I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.

ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Bruce.

BRUCE
It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and
made into soup.

CHUM
You're an inspiration to all of us.

ANCHOR
Amen.

BRUCE
Right, then. Who's next?

DORY
Ooh! Pick me! Pick me!

BRUCE
Yes, the little Sheila down the front.

DORY
Woo-hoo!

BRUCE
Come on up here.

DORY
Hi. I'm Dory.

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Dory.

DORY
And, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

CHUM
Hey, that's incredible.

BRUCE
Good on 'ya, mate!

DORY
Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.

BRUCE
All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?

MARLIN
Me? I don't have a problem.

BRUCE
Oh. Okay..

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
Denial.

BRUCE
Just start with your name.

MARLIN
Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--

CHUM
A clownfish? Really?!


                                             13

BRUCE
Go on, tell us a joke!

CHUM
Ooh! I love jokes!

MARLIN
Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea
cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the
sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

NEMO
Daddy!

MARLIN
Nemo!

CHUM
Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

BRUCE
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

MARLIN
No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.

DORY
Oh my, you poor fish.

CHUM
Humans. Think they own everything.

ANCHOR
Probably American.

BRUCE
Now there is a father looking for his little boy.

MARLIN
Ugh! What do these markings mean?

BRUCE
I never knew my father! [sobs]

CHUM
Aw, come here.

ANCHOR
Group hug.

CHUM
We're all mates here, mate.

MARLIN
I can't read human.

DORY
Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks!

MARLIN
No, no, no, Dory!

DORY
Guys, guys!

MARLIN
No, Dory!

DORY
That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww!

MARLIN
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

DORY
Ow, ow, ow.


                                             14

MARLIN
I'm so sorry.

DORY
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

MARLIN
Ohh...

DORY
Ow, ow, ow.

BRUCE
Dory, are you oka--oohh. Oohh, that's good.

ANCHOR/CHUM
Intervention!

BRUCE
Just a bite!

ANCHOR
Hold it together, mate!

CHUM
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!

BRUCE
FOOD!

MARLIN
Dory, look out!

BRUCE
I'm havin' fish tonight!

CHUM
Remember the steps, mate!

BRUCE
Just one bite!

BRUCE
G'day!

MARLIN/DORY
Aaaaaaaah!

BRUCE
Arrrr!

MARLIN
There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!

DORY
Who is it?

MARLIN
Dory, help me find a way out!

DORY
Sorry, you'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape.

MARLIN
There's gotta be a way out!

DORY
Look, here's something! 'ESSS-CA-PE'! I wonder what that means. It's funny, it's spelled
just like the word 'escape'.

MARLIN
Let's go!

BRUCE
Here's Brucey!

MARLIN

                                               15

Wait a minute..you can read?!

DORY
I can read? That's right, I can read!

MARLIN
Well, then here. Read this now!

ANCHOR
He really doesn't mean it, y'know! He never even knew his father!

CHUM
Don't fall off the wagon!

MARLIN
Oh no, it's blocked!

ANCHOR
No, Bruce. Focus!

CHUM
Sorry about--this, mate!

ANCHOR
He's really--a nice guy!

MARLIN
I need to get that mask!

DORY
You want that mask? Okay.

MARLIN
No, no, no, no, no, no!

MARLIN
Quick grab the mask!

ANCHOR
Oh no. Bruce?

BRUCE
What? [gasps] Swim away! Swim away!

DORY
Aw, is the party over?

PELICAN
Nice.

======================================================================================

NEMO
Dad? Daddy?

DENTIST
Barbara?

BARBARA
Uh-huh?

DENTIST
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few cotton rolls.

BARBARA
Okay.

DENTIST
Hello, little fella!

NEMO
Aah!

DENTIST
Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef and
I saved him. So, has that novocaine kicked in yet?


                                             16

PATIENT
I think so. We're ready to roll.

BUBBLES
Bubbles! [muttering] My bubbles.

PEACH
He likes bubbles.

NEMO
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

JACQUES
Bonjour.

NEMO
Aah!

BLOAT
Heh heh! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.

DEB
Oh, he's scared to death.

NEMO
I wanna go home. Do you know where my dad is?

PEACH
Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.

NEMO
Pet store?

BLOAT
Yeah, you know, like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

GURGLE
Pet Palace.

BUBBLES
Fish-O-Rama.

DEB
Mail order.

PEACH
Ebay.

GURGLE
So which one is it?

NEMO
I'm from the ocean.

GURGLE
Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aaah! He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!

JACQUES
Oui.

GURGLE
Clean him!

JACQUES
Oui.

GURGLE
Ocean!

JACQUES
Ooh, la mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean.

BUBBLES
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

NEMO
Big...and blue?

                                             17

BUBBLES
I knew it.

DEB
Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb, that's me. Or if I'm not
around, you can always talk to my sister Flo. Hi,how are you? Don't listen to anything
my sister says, she's nuts! Ha ha ha ha!

PEACH
[muffled] We got a live one!

BLOAT
Can't hear you, Peach.

PEACH
I said we got a live one.

GURGLE
Yes!

BLOAT
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

DEB
What do we got?

PEACH
Root canal, and by the looks of those x-rays it's not gonna be pretty.

PATIENT
Owwwwwwwww!

BLOAT
Rubber dam and clamp installed?

PEACH
Yep.

GURGLE
What did he use to open?

PEACH
Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.

DEB
I can't see, Flo.

PATIENT
You're getting a little too--aaaaah!!!

PEACH
Now he's doing the Schilder technique.

BLOAT
Oooh, he's using a Hedstrom file.

GURGLE
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

BLOAT
It's got a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.

GURGLE
No, no. K-Flex.

BLOAT
Hedstrom!

GURGLE
K-Flex!

BLOAT
Hedstro--! [inflates] There I go. A little help over here.

DEB
I'll go deflate him.

                                               18

DENTIST
All right, go ahead and rinse.

GURGLE
Ugh! The human mouth is a disgusting place.

PEACH
Hey, Nigel.

NIGEL
What did I miss? Am I late?

PEACH
Root canal and it's a doozy.

NIGEL
Root canal, eh? What did he use to open?

PEACH
Gator-Glidden drill.

NIGEL
He seems to be favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus...
hello.

NEMO
[gasps]

NIGEL
Who's this?

DEB
New guy. Ha ha ha!

GURGLE
The dentist took him off the reef.

NIGEL
An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I ever took a snap at you. Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat. [gasps]

DENTIST
Hey! No, no,   no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go! Go on, shoo! Oh,
the picture   broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight next week.
Hey, little   fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're
her present.   Shh, shh, shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up
I'm going to   see a man about a wallaby.

BLOAT
Oh, Darla.

NEMO
What? What's wrong with her?

GURGLE
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

BUBBLES
Poor Chuckles.

DEB
He was her present last year.

BLOAT
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

PEACH
She's a fish killer.

NEMO
I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me!

GURGLE
Oh, he's stuck!

GILL

                                               19

Nobody touch him! Nobody touch him.

NEMO
Can you help me?

GILL
No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

PEACH
Gill..

GILL
I just wanna see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

NEMO
I can't. I have a bad fin.

GILL
Never stopped me.

GILL
Just think about what you need to do.

BLOAT
Come on.

GILL
Perfect.

BUBBLES
Yay!

GURGLE
You did it!

DEB
Good squirming! Ha ha ha!

PEACH
Wow. From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

GILL
Yeah.

PEACH
I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?

GILL
I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.

BLOAT
So kid, you got a name or what?

NEMO
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

======================================================================================

MARLIN
Nemo. Nemo. [mutters]

DORY
Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer...

MARLIN
Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory!

DORY
Sea monkey has my money...

MARLIN
Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!

DORY
Yes, I'm a natural blue...

MARLIN

                                             20

Get up!

DORY
Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aaaaaah!

MARLIN/DORY
AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

DORY
Wow. Dusty.

MARLIN
[gasps] The mask! Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

DORY
[singing] Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot. Whoo-hoo! La la la la la la. Just keeps
going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Hey, what are you doing?

MARLIN
It's gone. I've lost the mask.

DORY
Did you drop it?

MARLIN
You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone.

DORY
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?

MARLIN
I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.

DORY
[singing] Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do?
We swim, swim.

MARLIN
Dory, no singing.

DORY
[singing] Ho ho ho ho ho ho! I love to swim! When you want to swim..

MARLIN
See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!

DORY
Sorry.

MARLIN
Dory, do you see anything?

DORY
Aaah! Something's got me!

MARLIN
That was me. I'm sorry.

DORY
[gasps] Who was that?

MARLIN
Who could it be? It's me!

DORY
Are..are you my conscience?

MARLIN
Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

DORY
Hmm, can't complain.

MARLIN
Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything?


                                             21

DORY
I see..I see a light.

MARLIN
A light.

DORY
Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience. Am I dead?

MARLIN
No, I see it too. What is it?

DORY
It's so pretty.

MARLIN
I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me.

DORY
I want to touch it. Oh!

MARLIN
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

DORY
[singing] I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you.

MARLIN
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone.

MARLIN
I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!

DORY
Haah!

MARLIN
The mask!

DORY
What mask?

DORY
Okay, I can't see a thing.

MARLIN
Oh, gee!

DORY
Hey, look! A mask!

MARLIN
Read it!

DORY
I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.
That's great, keep it right there.


MARLIN
Just read it!

DORY
Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh!
The first line's 'P. Sherman'!

MARLIN
P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!

DORY
Okay, second line. '42'.

MARLIN
Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah!

DORY
Light, please. 'Walla--Walla--Walla-beee'...

                                               22

MARLIN
Waah! Waaah! Waaaah!

DORY
The second line's '42 Wallaby Way'!

MARLIN
That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure!
Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!

DORY
'Sydney'. It's 'Sydney'!

MARLIN
Duck!

DORY
Aaah!

MARLIN
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead.

MARLIN
Whoo-hoo! [singing] We did it, we did it! Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! No eating here tonight, whoo!

BOTH
[singing] Eating here tonight!

MARLIN
Dory.

DORY
[singing] No, no, no eating here tonight. You on a diet--

MARLIN
Dory! What did the mask say?

DORY
'P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney'. [gasps] I remember what it said! I usually forget
things, but I remembered it this time!

MARLIN
Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that?

DORY
I don't know. But who cares? I remembered!

MARLIN/DORY
Aaah!

DORY
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!

======================================================================================

JACQUES
Psst. Nemo.

NEMO
Mmmm...

JACQUES
Nemo.

NEMO
Huh?

JACQUES
Suivez-moi. Follow me.

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
[chanting] Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ha! Ho!
Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hahoo! Wahoo! Yahoo! Ho! Ha! Ho! Wahee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hoo!

GILL
State your name.

                                             23

NEMO
Nemo.

GILL
Brother Bloat, proceed.

BLOAT
Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount
Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

NEMO
Huh?

PEACH
We want you in our club, kid.

NEMO
Really?

BLOAT
If you are able to swim through..THE RING OF FIRE! [whispers to Jacques] Turn on the
Ring of Fire! The Ring of Fire, you said you could do it--THE RING OF FIRE!

BUBBLES
Bubbles! Bubbles! Let me--oww!

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
[chanting]

PEACH
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy!

JACQUES
[wailing]

GILL
From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

GILL
Welcome, brother Sharkbait!

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

GILL
Enough with the Sharkbait.

GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh..ba-ba-doo.

GILL
Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Agreed!

GILL
We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help
him escape.

NEMO
Escape? Really?

GILL
We're all gonna escape!

GURGLE
Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.

DEB
Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.


                                               24

BLOAT
Yeah. Why should this be any different?

GILL
'Cause we've got him.

NEMO
Me?

GILL
You see that filter?

NEMO
Yeah?

GILL
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take
a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and
filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And
when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll
ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the
street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me?

BLOAT
Aye!

JACQUES
Aye!

DEB
Aye!

BUBBLES
Aye!

GURGLE
I think your nuts.

GILL/NEMO
[sighs]

GURGLE
No offense, kid, but, um..you're not the best swimmer.

GILL
He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think?

NEMO
Let's do it.

======================================================================================

DORY
I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P.
Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you're askin' where I'm goin'. I'll tell you that's
where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way...

MARLIN
Excuse me. Ex-excuse me, um, hi. Do you know how to get to--hello? W-w-w-wait! Can you
tell me--hey! Hold it! Wait a minute! I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, fellas, come back
here. Please, one quick question. I need to aaaaand they're gone again. [sighs]

DORY
P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell
you again. I don't get tired of it--

MARLIN
Okay, all right.

DORY
Huh?

MARLIN
Here's the thing.

DORY

                                             25

Uh-huh.

MARLIN
Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself.

DORY
Okay.

MARLIN
Y'know, alone.

DORY
Uh-huh.

MARLIN
Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you...
with me.

DORY
Huh?

MARLIN
I don't wanna hurt your feelings..

DORY
You want me to leave?

MARLIN
Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays
and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's
a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'.

DORY
You mean..[whimper]you mean you don't..like me? [sobs]

MARLIN
No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a
complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you.

MOONFISH LEADER
Hey, you! Lady, is this guy botherin' you?

DORY
Um, I don't remember. Were you?

MARLIN
No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to--

MOONFISH LEADER
Look, pal. We're talkin' to the lady, not you. Hey-hey, you like impressions?

DORY
Mm-mmm-mmmm.

MOONFISH LEADER
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So, what are we? Take a guess.

DORY
Oh, oh, I've seen one of those.

MOONFISH LEADER
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

DORY
Wait, wait, um..

MARLIN
It's a swordfish.

MOONFISH LEADER
Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess. Where's the butter?

DORY
Oh-oh-oh! It's on the tip of my tongue.

MARLIN
[coughs up answer]Lobster.

                                             26

MOONFISH LEADER
Saw that.

MARLIN
What?

MOONFISH LEADER
Lots of legs, lives in the ocean.

DORY
Clam!

MOONFISH LEADER
Close enough. [singing] Oh, it's a whale of a tale, I'll tell you lad, a whale of a tale.

DORY
Oh, they're good.

MARLIN
Will somebody please give me directions?

MOONFISH LEADER
[impersonating Marlin] Will somebody please give me directions?

DORY
Ha ha ha ha ha!

MARLIN
I'm serious.

MOONFISH LEADER
Blah-blah-blah! Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!

MARLIN
Thank you.

DORY
Oh dear. Hey, hey come back! Hey, what's the matter?

MARLIN
What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from
home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name.

DORY
Boy, bet that's frustrating.

MARLIN
Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there.

DORY
You're son Chico?

MARLIN
Nemo.

DORY
Right. Got it.

MARLIN
But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me.

DORY
Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.

MOONFISH LEADER
What, is he bothering you again?

DORY
No, no, he's a good guy. Go easy on him, he's lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

MOONFISH LEADER
Sydney? Oh sure. Why, Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?

MOONFISH TED
Sure do.

                                             27

DORY
Oh, hey! They know Sydney!

MARLIN
[gasps]

DORY
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?

MOONFISH LEADER
What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that's the East Australian Current. Big current,
can't miss it, it's in..that direction. And then you gotta follow that for about, I
don't know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby's gonna
put you right past Sydney.

MOONFISH SCHOOL
TA-DAA!

MARLIN
Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!

DORY
Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along, that's me.

MARLIN
Well, listen fellas, thank you.

MOONFISH LEADER
Don't mention it. And, uh, loosen up. Okay, buddy?

DORY
Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

MOONFISH LEADER
Oh, hey ma'am, one more thing.

DORY
Yes.

MOONFISH LEADER
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

DORY
Trench, through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait up, partner.
Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I gotta tell you something..whoa. Nice trench. Hello!
Okay, let's go.

MARLIN
Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing.

DORY
Whoa, whoa, partner. Little red flag goin' up. Somethin's telling me we should swim through
it, not over it.

MARLIN
Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.

DORY
I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should swim through.

MARLIN
And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.

DORY
Come on, trust me on this.

MARLIN
Trust you?

DORY
Yes, trust. It's what friends do.

MARLIN
Look! Something shiny!

DORY

                                             28

Where?

MARLIN
Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it.

DORY
Okay.

DORY
Boy, sure is clear up here.

MARLIN
Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time.

DORY
Hey, little guy.

MARLIN
You wanted to go through the trench.

DORY
I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come here,
Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. [Baby talk]---oww!

MARLIN
Dory! That's a jellyfish!

DORY
Bad Squishy! Bad Squishy!

MARLIN
Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see.

DORY
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

MARLIN
I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look.

DORY
Heeey, how come it didn't sting you?

MARLIN
It did. It's just that..

DORY
Ow! Ow, oww!

MARLIN
..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings.
Come here.

DORY
Ow, ow! Oww!

MARLIN
It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?

DORY
Yeah.

MARLIN
That we don't wanna touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a
little one.[gasps]

MARLIN/DORY
Aaaah!

MARLIN
Don't move! This is bad, Dory.

DORY
Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing!

MARLIN
[gasps] Dory!


                                             29

DORY
Boing-boing-boing! [singing] You can't catch me!

MARLIN
Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you,
that's it!

DORY
Ooh! Two in a row, beat that.

MARLIN
Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.

DORY
A game?

MARLIN
A game.

DORY
A game?

MARLIN
Yes.

DORY
Aah! I love games! Pick me!

MARLIN
All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins.

DORY
Okay!

MARLIN
Rules, rules, rules!

DORY
Okay!

MARLIN
You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops.

DORY
Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!

MARLIN
W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait!

DORY
Weeee!

MARLIN
Dory!

DORY
Gotta go faster if you wanna win!

MARLIN
[gasps] Dory!

DORY
Boing! Boing! Boing-boing-boing-boing!

MARLIN
Wait a minute--whoa! Dory!

DORY
Weeee!

MARLIN
So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time.
I can do this, just be careful.

DORY
Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!


                                             30

MARLIN
Oh, I don't think so!

DORY
Ha ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed.

MARLIN
The question is, Dory, are you hungry?

DORY
Huh? Hungry?

MARLIN
Yeah, 'cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish
is the winner! Woohoo! We did it! We're gonna...Dory? Oh no. Dory! Dory! Dory! [gasps]
Dory! Uggghhh!

DORY
Ugh...am I disqualified?

MARLIN
No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where
does P. Sherman live?

DORY
P..Sherman..Wallaby Way...Sydney...

MARLIN
That's it! Oww! Ow! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ow! Stay awake! Stay--awake!

DORY
Awake...P..Sherman..

MARLIN
Awake...

DORY
..42 Wallaby Way...

MARLIN
Awake...wake up...Nemo...

GILL
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?

NEMO
Yeah.

GILL
Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you.

NEMO
He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean.

GILL
Peach, any movement?

PEACH
He's had at least four cups of coffee, it's gotta be soon.

GILL
Keep on him.

GILL
My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet.

NEMO
Toilet?

GILL
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

NEMO
Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?


                                             31

GILL
Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya.

BUBBLES
Bubbles! Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles---

PEACH
Potty break! Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest! We have 4.2 minutes.

GILL
That's your cue, Sharkbait.

BLOAT
You can do it, kid.

GILL
Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber
and I'll talk you through the rest.

NEMO
Okay.

GILL
Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp.

NEMO
[takes a deep breath]

GILL
Nicely done! Can you hear me?

NEMO
Yeah.

GILL
Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening?

NEMO
Uh-huh.

GILL
Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the
fan to stop it turning.

NEMO
Aaah!

GILL
Careful, Sharkbait.

NEMO
I can't do it!

PEACH
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

GILL
He'll be fine. Try again.

NEMO
Okay.

GILL
That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.

NEMO
I got it! I got it!

PEACH
[sigh]

BLOAT
He did it!

GURGLE
Whew!


                                             32

GILL
That's great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out.

NEMO
Oh no! Gill! Gill!

GILL
Sharkbait!

BLOAT
Oh my gosh!

GILL
Get 'im outta there! Get 'im outta there!

BUBBLES
Help him!

GURGLE
What do we do!? What do we do!?

PEACH
Oh no!

GILL
Stay calm, kid! Just don't panic!

NEMO
Help me!

GILL
Sharkbait! Grab hold of this!

NEMO
No! No!

GILL
Feed me more!

GURGLE
That's it!

GILL
Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it!

NEMO
I got it!

GILL
Pull!

PEACH
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

GILL
No. We're done.

Ooooh...

Oh, he lives! Hey, dude!

MARLIN
Ooooh..what happened?


                                             33

CRUSH
Oh, saw the whole thing, dude. First you were like, 'whoa'! And then we were all like,
'whoa'! And then you were like, 'whoa'.

MARLIN
What're you talking about?

CRUSH
You, mini-man. Takin' on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude.

MARLIN
Ooh.

CRUSH
Awesome.

MARLIN
Ooh..ooh, my stomach. Ooooh..

CRUSH
Oh, man. No hurlin' on the shell, dude, okay, just waxed it.

MARLIN
So Mr. Turtle...

CRUSH
Whoa, dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. Name's Crush.

CRUSH
Ha ha! Righteous! Righteous! Yeah!

MARLIN
Stop!

CRUSH
So, what brings you on this fine day to the EAC?

MARLIN
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney. [gasps] Dory! Dory! Is she all right!?

CRUSH
Oh. Oh, Little Blue. She is sub-level, dude.

MARLIN
Dory, Dory! Dory!

DORY
Hmm-mmm....

MARLIN
Oh, Dory. I-I-I'm so sorry. This is all my fault, it's my fault...

DORY
..29, 30! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Catch me if you can! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

MARLIN
Huh?

SQUIRT
Whoa!

[gasps] Oh my goodnes!


                                               34

CRUSH
Whoa. Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

SQUIRT
Whoa! Whoa! That was so cool! Hey dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see
what I did?

CRUSH
You so totally rock, Squirt! So give me some fin..noggin..

CRUSH/SQUIRT

CRUSH
Oh, intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.

SQUIRT
Jellies? Sweet.

CRUSH
Totally.

MARLIN
Well, apparently, I must've done something you all like. Heh, uh, dudes.

SQUIRT
You rock, dude.

MARLIN
Ow.

CRUSH
Curl away, my son. Aw, it's awesome, Jellyman. Little dudes are just eggs, leave 'em
on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big 'ol blue.

MARLIN
All by themselves?

CRUSH
Yeah.

MARLIN
But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready?

CRUSH
Well, you never really know. But when they'll know, you'll know, you know? Ha.

DORY
Hey! Look, everybody!

SQUIRT
I know that dude. It's the Jellyman.

DORY
Well, go on, jump on him.

TURTLE KIDS
Turtle pile!

MARLIN
W-w-wai-wait--

TURTLE KID 1
Are you funny?

TURTLE KID 2
Where's your shell?

MARLIN
Hold on, I need to breath--

TURTLE KID 3
Are you running away?

TURTLE KID 4
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?


                                             35

TURTLE KID 5
Did they sting you?

MARLIN
One at a time!

TURTLE KID 6
Mr. Fish, did you die?

DORY
Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.

SQUIRT
So where are you going?

MARLIN
Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.

TURTLE KIDS
[gasp]

DORY
No way.

SQUIRT
What happened?

MARLIN
No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it.

TURTLE KIDS
Awww! Please?

SQUIRT
Pleeeease?

MARLIN
[sighs] Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here.

DORY
Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.

MARLIN
And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been
so tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when
he was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.
So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them...

TURTLE KID
They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..

SMALL FISH
..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!

BIG FISH
Golly, that's amazing!

SMALL FISH
And then dives thousands of..

LOBSTER
..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.
How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..

SWORDFISH
..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...

DOLPHIN
So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian
Current.

FEMALE BIRD
Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..

MALE BIRD 1
..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..

                                               36

MALE BIRD 2
..nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

MALE BIRD 3
That's one dedicated father if you ask me.

GULLS
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

NIGEL
Oh, would you just shut up! You're rats with wings!

PELICAN
..bloke's been lookin' for his boy Nemo.

NIGEL
Nemo?

PELICAN
He was taken off the reef by divers and this..

NIGEL
There, take it! You happy!

GULLS
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

NIGEL
Hey, hey, hey! Say that again! You said something about Nemo. What was it?

GULLS
Mine! Mine! Mine!

CRAB
Whooooooaaa..watcha!

GULL
Mine!

PELICAN
Last I heard, he's headin' towards the harbor.

NIGEL
Ho ho! Brilliant!

======================================================================================

NEMO
[sighs]

DEB
Is he doing okay?

GURGLE
I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention D-A-R..

NEMO
It's okay, I know who you're talking about.

NEMO
Gill? Gill?

GILL
Hey, Sharkbait.

NEMO
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the--

GILL
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that
ocean. I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that.
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.

NIGEL
All right! Hey, hey, hey, hey--!


                                              37

DENTIST
What the!?

PATIENT
AAAAAAAAAH!!! Oooooh...

DENTIST
Well, uh, that's one way to pull a tooth. He he he he he! Huh, darn kids. Well, good
thing I pulled the right one, eh, prime minister? He he he he!

NIGEL
Hey, hey. Psst!

PEACH
Oh, Nigel. You just missed an extraction.

NIGEL
Ooh! Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet--oh, what I'm talkin' about!? Nemo!
Where's Nemo? I gotta speak with him.

NEMO
What? What is it?

NIGEL
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.

NEMO
My father? Really?

GILL
Really?

NIGEL
Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and
all sorts of--

NEMO
Sharks? That can't be him.

NIGEL
Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout..

NEMO
Marlin?

NIGEL
That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.

NEMO
It's my dad! He took on a shark!

NIGEL
I heard he took on three.

DEB/BLOAT/GURGLE
Three!?

GILL
Three sharks!?

BLOAT
That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth!

NIGEL
You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat
you were on like a maniac.

NEMO
Really?

NIGEL
He's swimming and   he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic
sharks capture him   and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased
by a monster with   huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a
reward? He gets to   battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch
of sea turtles on   the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right
now, to Sydney!

                                               38

BLOAT
Wow! Ha ha ha!

DEB
Oh, what a good daddy!

GILL
He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait.

GILL
[gasps]

GURGLE
He's swimming to the filter!

GILL
[gasps] Sharkbait!

BLOAT
Not again!

GILL
Sharkbait!

DEB
No!

GURGLE
You've got your whole life ahead of you!

BLOAT
Oh no!

GILL
We'll help you, kid!

BLOAT
Gotta get him out!

DEB
Gimme that thing!

DEB
Get him outta there!

GURGLE
Come on, kid! Grab the end!

ALL
[gasps]

DEB
Sharkbait!

BLOAT
Sharkbait! Are you okay!?

GURGLE
No!

GILL
Can you hear me, Sharkbait!? Nemo! Can you hear me!?

NEMO
Yeah, I can hear you.

GILL
Sharkbait, you did it!

GURGLE
Sharkbait, you're--covered with germs! Aaaaaaah!!!

GILL
That took guts, kid.

GILL

                                               39

All right, gang. We have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here. This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time but we have to help it along any way we can. Jacques!

JACQUES
Oui!

GILL
No cleaning.

JACQUES
I shall resist.

GILL
Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank
so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it.

BLOAT
[belch]

GILL
Good work.

NEMO
Ha ha ha ha!

======================================================================================

CRUSH
All right, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's comin' up, man!

MARLIN
Where!? I don't see it!

DORY
Right there! I see it! I see it!

MARLIN
You mean the swirling vortex of terror!?

CRUSH
That's it, dude!

MARLIN
Of course it is.

CRUSH
Okay, first: find your exit buddy!

CRUSH
Do you have your exit buddy?

DORY
Yes!

CRUSH
Okay, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique!

SQUIRT
Good afternoon, we're gonna have a great jump today! Okay, crank a hard cutback as you hit
the wall! There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember: rip it, roll it and
punch it!

MARLIN
It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't
know what you're saying! Say the first thing again!

CRUSH
Okay, Jellyman! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

MARLIN/DORY
Aaaaaaaaaah!!! Weeeeeeeeeeee!!! Whoooooooooooaaaaa!!! Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! Woohoooo!!!
Whoooooaaa!!!

DORY
Whoooo!

MARLIN

                                             40

Ha ha ha ha! That was..fun! Ha ha! I actually enjoyed that!

DORY
Hey, look! Turtles!

CRUSH
Ha ha! Most excellent! Now, turn your fishy tails 'round and swim straight on through
to Sydney! No worries, man!

MARLIN
No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!

TURTLE KIDS
Bye! Bye, Jellyman!

CRUSH
You tell your little dude I said 'hi', okay?

SQUIRT
See you later, dudes!

DORY
Bye, everyone!

MARLIN
Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you?

CRUSH
Hundred and fifty, dude! And still young! Rock on!

MARLIN
Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that.

DORY
Whoa. We goin' in there?

MARLIN
Yup.

DORY
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

MARLIN
Yup. We're gonna just swim straight.

DORY
[singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.

MARLIN
Dory?

======================================================================================

MARLIN
Boy, this is taking a while.

DORY
Hey, how about we play a game?

MARLIN
Okay.

DORY
Uh, okay. I'm thinking of something, uh, orange. And it's small..

MARLIN
It's me.

DORY
Right. Okay..

DORY
..orange, and uh, small..

MARLIN
It's me.


                                               41

DORY
All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants.

DORY
..orange and small, and white stripes..

MARLIN
Me. And the next one's just a guess: me.

DORY
Okay, that's just scary.

MARLIN
W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it
before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!

DORY
Hey. Hey!

MARLIN
We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me!
Wha--?

DORY
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

MARLIN
Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!

DORY
Well, there has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here.
Let's see...okay, no one there. Uhh, nope. Nada. [gasps] There's somebody. Hey! Excuse--

MARLIN
Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out
our bones!

DORY
What is it with men and asking for directions?

MARLIN
Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the
'Let's Not Die' card.

DORY
You wanna get outta here, don't you?

MARLIN
Of course, I do.

DORY
Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Hmmm?
Hmmmm!? Come on, trust me on this.

MARLIN
All right.

DORY
Excuse me! Woohoo! Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude, say 'hi'.

MARLIN
Ha..hello.

DORY
His son Bingo..

MARLIN
Nemo.

DORY
..Nemo, was taken to, uh..

MARLIN
Sydney.

DORY

                                             42

Sydney. Yes. And it's really, really important that we get there as fast as we can. So can
you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on.

MARLIN
Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella.

DORY
Oh. Oh, oh, big fella. Big fe--whale. Okay. Maybe he only speaks whale.
MOOOOO-WEEEEEEE-NEEEEED...

MARLIN
Uh, Dory..what're you doing?

DORY
TOOOOOOO-FIIIIIIND...

MARLIN
What're you doing?

DORY
HIS-SOOOOOOOOOOOON...

MARLIN
Are you sure you speak whale?

DORY
CAN-YOOOOOOOUUU-GIIIIIIIIIVE-USSSS-DIRECTIOOOOOOOONS-TOOOOOOOOO...

MARLIN
Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away.

DORY
COOOME-BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!

MARLIN
He's not coming back. You offended him.

DORY
Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!

MARLIN
Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach.

DORY
Maybe I should try humpback.

MARLIN
No, don't try humpback.

DORY
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOO!!! WAAAAAAAAAOOOOOO!!!

MARLIN
Okay, you actually sound sick.

DORY
Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!!

MARLIN
Don't do that!

DORY
Too much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish?

MARLIN
It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!

DORY
MOOOO..MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

MARLIN
It's just as well, he might be hungry.

DORY
Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill.

KRILL

                                             43

Swim away!

DORY
Oh, look. Krill.

MARLIN
Move, Dory! Move!

DORY
Aah-aaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

======================================================================================

GILL
Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to
you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning!

JACQUES
I am ashamed.

PEACH
Hey, look. Scum angel.

GURGLE
Aah! Aaaah! Ooh-ooh! Aaaaah!

Bubbles! I love the bubbles--! [coughs]

PEACH
Nine o' clock and cue dentist.

DENTIST
Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

PEACH
Okay. Okay, here we go. Here we go, okay.

DENTIST
Little Davey Reynolds.

PEACH
Okay. Walks to the counter, drops the keys..

GURGLE
Bloat, that's disgusting!

BLOAT
Tastes pretty good to me. [belch]

GURGLE
Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own--

PEACH
Shhh! Here he comes.

DENTIST
Crikey, what a state. Oh. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?

BARBARA
Uh, ten 'o clock, luv.

DENTIST
Leave it open, would you? I gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

GILL
He he! Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

NEMO
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean!

GILL
Are you ready to see your dad, kid?


                                               44

NEMO
Uh-huh.

GILL
Of course you are. Y'know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor
waitin' for you right now.

NEMO
Yeah.

======================================================================================

MARLIN
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof!

DORY
Ha~~haaa~~haaaaaaah! Whooo!

MARLIN
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

DORY
Here comes a big one--whooooooo! Come on, you gotta try this!

MARLIN
Would you just stop it!?

DORY
Why? What's wrong?

MARLIN
We're in a whale! Don't you get it!?

DORY
A whale?

MARLIN
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!

DORY
Wow. A whale. You know I speak whale.

MARLIN
No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son!
I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! [sobs]

DORY
Woo-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoo! Hey. You okay?

DORY
There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay.

MARLIN
No. No, it won't.

DORY
Sure it will, you'll see.

MARLIN
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.

DORY
Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.

MARLIN
What?

DORY
Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him.
Not much fun for little Harpo.

DORY
Hmm..

MARLIN
What's going on?


                                               45

DORY
I don't know. I'll ask him. MMMWWHAAAAAAAAA! HUUUWHAAAAAAAAA..

MARLIN
Dory. Dory.

MARLIN
..AAAAAAAAAAT'SSS-GOOIIIIIIING..

MARLIN
Dory.

DORY
..OOOOOOOOONNN?

DORY
I think he says we've stopped.

MARLIN
Of course, we've stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse.
[gasps] What is that noise? Oh no. Look what you did. The water's going down!
It's-it's-it's going down!

DORY
Really? You sure about that?

MARLIN
Look, it's already half-empty!

DORY
Hmm..I'd say it's half full.

MARLIN
Stop that! It's half-empty!

DORY
Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat
or he wants a root beer float.

MARLIN
Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!?
Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!

DORY
Okay. HEEEEEEEEE--

MARLIN
Stop talking to him--waaaah!

DORY
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

MARLIN
What is going on!?

DORY
I'll check! WHAAAAAAA--!

MARLIN
No! No more whale! You can't speak whale!

DORY
Yes, I can!

MARLIN
No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo!

DORY
Okay.

MARLIN
Dory!

DORY
He says it's time to let go! Everything's gonna be all right!

MARLIN

                                             46

How do you know!? How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen!?

DORY
I don't!

MARLIN/DORY
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

MARLIN
Ha ha ha! We're alive!

DORY
Look! Sy-d-ney..Sydney! Uh, Sydney! Sydney again!

MARLIN
You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son!

MARLIN
THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK-YOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUU-SIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

DORY
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

MARLIN
Okay. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.

DORY
Right!

MARLIN
Come on, Dory. We can do this!

======================================================================================

PEACH

Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall.

NEMO

You won't go belly up, I promise. You're gonna be okay.

No, but the boat has to be here somewhere! Come on, Dory, we're gonna find it.

I'm totally excited. [yawn] Are you excited? [yawn]

MARLIN
Dory, wake up, wake up. Come on.

DEB
Yay!

BUBBLES
I'm so happy!

Is he gonna be okay, Gill?

Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean.

I'm, I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.

DORY
Hey..

MARLIN
Dory. If it wasn't for you, I never even would have made it here. So, thank you.

DORY
Hey! Hey, wait a minute. W-w-wait! Where are you going?

MARLIN
It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone and I'm going home now.

DORY
No..no, you can't! Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No  one's ever stuck with me for
so long before. And if you leave, if you leave...I just,  I remember things better with you.
I do. Look, P. Sherman, 42..40..2..agh! I remember it, I  do. It's there, I know it is
because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I, I look  at you and...I'm home. Please.
I don't want them to go away. I don't wanna forget.

MARLIN
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

No, I am not gonna lose you again!

NEMO
Dad, there's no time! It's the only way we can save Dory! I can do this!

Oh no. Nemo!

MARLIN
Nemo? Nemo? It's okay. Daddy's here, daddy's got you.

NEMO
[coughs] Daddy?

MARLIN
Oh, thank goodness.

NEMO
Dad...I don't hate you.

MARLIN
No, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo.

MARLIN
Hey, guess what?

NEMO
What?

MARLIN
Sea turtles? I met one! And he was a hundred and fifty years old.

NEMO
Hundred and fifty?

MARLIN
Yep.

NEMO
'Cause Sandy Plankton said they only live to be a hundred.

MARLIN
Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as
Sandy Plankton!?

NEMO
Ha ha ha ha!

MARLIN
He was a hundred and fifty! Not one hundred! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?

======================================================================================

MARLIN
Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Go!

MARLIN
I'm gonna win!

NEMO
No, you're not! I did it! Woohoo! Ha ha ha!

MARLIN
Oh! My own son beats me!

MR. RAY
Climb aboard, explorers!

MARLIN
So just then, the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says : 'with fronds like these,
who needs anemones?'!

BOB/TED/BILL
Haaa-ha ha ha ha ha ha!

MR. RAY
Well, hello, Nemo! Who's this?

NEMO
Exchange student.

                                              58

Barbara?

BARBARA
Uh-huh?

DENTIST
I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks! Had to clean
the tank myself, take all the fish out, put 'em in bags and---where'd the fish go?

GILL
Come on, Peach!

DEB
Hurry!

GILL
You can do it!

BLOAT
Yeah, that's it! You can do it!

Just a little further!

FLASH GORDON



                                   Written by

                                Lorenzo Semple Jr.


                         
          FADE IN:
                         
          EXT. WIDE AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - MORNING
                         
          At first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an
          endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums
          beating in the distance coming from some unknown place.
                         
          The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly:
          the white disc goes through a rapid series of color
          transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible
          BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT.
                         
          The sky echoes with THUNDER.
                         
          We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush
          stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with
          each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.
                         
          Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning
          blood-red savanna.
                         
          EXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY
                         
          I's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It
          buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's
          almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds.
                         
          INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY
                         
          There are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN,
          a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and
          reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A
          Guide to Survival In The City." A few rows forward, near the
          open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.
          He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed
          things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows
          indicating the directions of movement.
                         
          Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks
          the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with
          sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture
          that's habitual to her in moments of stress.
                         
          There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She
          looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily,
          leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.
                         
          INT. PLANE/ COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
          (CO-P:ILOT, DALE, FLASH, PILOT)
                         
                          FLASH
           What was that, fellas?
           2.
                         
                          PILOT
           Clear-air turbulence, is all. Nothing
                          SERIOUS
                         
                          CO-PILOT
           But nothing you'd want to toss a
           third-down pass through either --
           (Grinning back at
                          FLASH)
           Can I have an autograph for my kid,
           Mr. Gordon?
                         
                          FLASH
           Sure -- my pleasure.
                         
          As FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane
          takes another jolt, even more violent than the first.
                         
                          PILOT
           Wow. Call Westchester Approach, see
           what they've got.
                         
                          FLASH
           I sure hope we don't have to turn
           back. I mean this is first day of
           training camp, I wouldn't want to be
                          LATE --
                         
                          PILOT
           Seat-belt time.
                         
          FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders
          violently. He holds on, calls up front:
                         
                          FLASH
           Maybe it'd be smoother if you went
                          HIGHER --
                         
                          DALE
           Will you SHUT UP?
           (as FLASH's head
                          SWIVELS)
           Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have
           their hands full -- just let 'em
           drive.
                         
          INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS
          (DALE, FLASH)
                         
          The plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of
          the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to
          her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it
          to her.
           3.
                         
                          FLASH
           When you're nervous, it can help to
           chew on something
                         
                          DALE
           Thanks a lot -- I look dumb enough
           to take candy from a stranger?
                         
                          FLASH
           I'm not a stranger exactly -- You
           know my name.
                         
                          DALE
           Who doesn't. Number one draft pick,
           cover of PEOPLE mag -- what'd the
           GIANTS sign you for, eighty-nine
           million? Big deal!
                         
                          FLASH
           Of course.
                         
                          DALE
           God, I hate flying -- I'm Dale Arden
           it's crazy of me to hate flying --
           I'm a travel agent, you see? -- I've
           just been checking out a little hotel
           in Vermont -- can I still have that
           candy bar?
           (and in the same breath)
           Are we going backward?
                         
                          FLASH
           Backwards?
                         
                          DALE (GASP)
           Holy cow! Look at the clouds!
                         
          EXT. SKY - POV FROM PLANE WINDOW - DAY
                         
          The pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to
          surround the airplane. Over the engines we HEAR that same
          ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening. Slowly
          and terrifyingly, the sun starts turning BLOOD RED. The clouds
          race faster, faster, until they are actually streaming past
          the plane from behind.
                         
          INT. PLANE - DAY
                         
          FLASH and DALE -- faces bathed in the eerie light. Speechless-
          DALE grasps the football player's hand with all her strength.
                         
          EXT. A FANTASTIC GREENHOUSE - DAY
                         
          It is a huge and rambling, antique, standing in semiruinous
          isolation in a pretty country landscape. The sun has turned

          the SAME BLOOD RED we saw from the airplane, and clouds race
          across it with unnatural velocity.
                         
          In the center of the greenhouse rises a glass-paned tower
          through which we glimpse something MIRROR BRIGHT. Floating
          high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium-
          filled balloons, secured by wires. As we move closer, we
          discern a MAN moving about actively on a platform inside the
          central tower, about half-way up:
                         
          INT. GREENHOUSE TOWER - DAY
          (MUNSON, TV NEWSMAN, ZARKOV)
                         
          The man is DR. HANS ZARKOV: big, bearded, feverish looking
          and seemingly half mad with exhaustion. In striking contrast
          to the antique greenhouse exterior, here there are all kinds
          of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash
          fashion. Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and
          dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view. As
          Zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a
          grim-voiced TV. NEWSMAN is appearing and speaking from a
          good-sized television screen above the main control console:
                         
                          TV NEWSMAN
           The extraordinary weather disturbances
           reported from Africa this morning
           are now crossing the Atlantic, and
           are expected to reach the East Coast
           of the United States by noon.
           According to scientists at NASA, the
           Earth is being struck by an immense
           stream of cosmic energy, apparently
           the result of some catastrophic
           stellar accident beyond the reaches
                          OF --
                         
          ZARKOV whirls, slams the TV SOUND OFF and yells at the
          silently mouthing NEWSMAN on the screen.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Fools! Can't you understand? This
           is no accident-- it's an ATTACK! An
           attack planned by a MIND! This is
           ATTACK!
                         
          MUNSON, a scared looking assistant, comes running up the
          stairs with a computer print-out sheet.
                         
                          MUNSON
           Dr. Zarkov! Look at the report from
           the last balloon!
                         
          ZARKOV grabs it, eyes it.

                          ZARKOV

                          MUNSON
           Yes, sir -- you sure did. And this
           funny sun too ---

                          ZARKOV
           What the hell do I care? I tried to
           warn him -- he called me mad, like
           all the others.
                         
          BOOM! The TV screen EXPLODES in a fine shower of glass.
                         
                          ZARKOV (CONT'D)
           Time for us to go, Munson. Get your
           toothbrush and whatever.
                         
                          MUNSON
           Go where?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Up. Up and at him.
                         
          Stunned, MUNSON turns his head and glances at something big
          and MIRROR BRIGHT gleaming behind foliage in center of tower.
                         
                          MUNSON
           You're crazy!
                         
          Perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes,
          ZARKOV pulls out a revolver and points it at MUNSON.
                         
                          ZARKOV

          INT. COCKPIT TO SKY - POV
          (CO-PILOT, PILOT)
                         
          The PILOTS watch these clouds also, transfixed with disbelief.
          They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of
          professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe.

           Say, get a load of the VOR's....
                         
          The directional needles are going crazy. All the instruments
          are going crazy. Displays flash impossible symbols. The
          PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the
          sky and swallows.
                         
                          PILOT
           On the left, about six o'clock
           high......
                         
          The racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some
          surreal painting. From the cortex LASER-like bolts of RED
          LIGHTNING shoot out. Like a missile, one zaps right over the
          plane's nose with a horrible crackling NOISE.
                         
                          PILOT (CONT'D)
           Hold on tight, let's put baby down
           right here......
                         
          The CO-PILOT reaches up and hits the flap control. There is
          a whooshing crackling ZAP! The whole cockpit FLARES OUT
          with an intolerable blinding flash of RED LIGHT.
                         
          INT. PASSENGER CABIN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The cockpit door flys off its hinges, admitting a gale of
          wind that scatters FLASH'S play sheets like autumn leaves.
          FLASH unsnaps his belt, leaps up and races forward.
                         
          INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
          (DALE, FLASH)
                         
          The TWO PILOTS are gone, vanished without trace. Wind from
          the shattered windows assaults FLASH as he charges in. He
          stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. Recovering
          he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the
          bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals.
          DALE lurches in against the tornado.
                         
                          DALE

          DALE staggers into the co-pilot's seat, pulls back on the
          wheel in front of her.

          flat area.
                         
          Another barrage of crackling RED LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot all
          around the plane but just miss it.

          Its thousands of panes reflect the RED SUN and the RED BOLTS
          which rain down in intermittent bursts. One strikes an end
          of a gallery, exploding glass and foliage. From inside, we
          HEAR a furious echoing VOICE:
                         
                          ZARKOV'S VOICE

          ZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his
          revolver. MUNSON emerges from some dry brown bush where he
          was hiding.
                         
                          MUNSON
           So what's it matter if I'm shot or

           Of course -- I admit that! But this
           way you'll be giving your life for a
           chance of saving Earth! Haven't you
           any spirit at all??

           Goodbye, Doctor -- they were all
           right about you. Have a nice trip.
                         
          MUNSON starts walking away, toward the door at the end of
          the long side wing.
                         
                          ZARKOV

          If you woo't come, who will I find:
                         
          MUNSON ignores him totally, keeps walking away. ZARKOV lifts
          his revolver and draws a bead on the man's back. Just as he
          is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside.

          Amazingly, a Twin Otter is gliding in to a horribly rough
          landing in the field outside. The plane hits on one wheel,
          bounces into the air, comes down again and keeps right on
          rolling toward the greenhouse.

          SLAMMING IN through the greenhouse wall, burying MUNSON
          totally under the wreckage.

          ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the
          tower stairs. SUddenly DALE stops short, staring at ZARKOV
          with a funny expression.

                          FLASH
           Well, all right -- but it seems to
           me we ought to --
                         
          Now it's FLASH'S turn to break off. ZARKOV is pointing a
          gun at him.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Up the stairs to the tower! Ahead
           of me -- quick! --
           (as they gape at him,
                          FROZEN)
           Quick I said: We haven't much time --
           Earth is being attacked! -- there's
           only one slim chance of saving it!
                         
                          FLASH
           Mister, you are insane!
                         
          HOWL of ether-wind increases. Storm of RED LASER BOLTS. Glass
          showers them as parts of the green house EXPLODE and dry
          foliage bursts into FLAME.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Up the stairs -- RUN!
                         
          ZARKOV jabs the revolver into DALE'S back. RED BOLTS zap
          around. FLASH whispers to her as they start running up ahead
          of ZARKOV.
                         
                          FLASH
           Go with the flow -- wait for a chance!
                         
          Below them, bottom of staircase disintergrates in a RED FLASH.
           11.
                         
          INT. TOP LEVEL OF GREENHOUSE TOWER
          (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)
                         
          ZARKOV rips away a screen of foliage, revealing a MIRROR
          BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door. He yanks that
          open.
                         
          On every side things are blowing up and burning under the
          merciless rain of bolts. One strikes the capsule head on,
          but does not even leave a mark.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           I need your help to take off! Get
           in or I shot you dead!
                         
          DALE gasps and shrinks back.
                         
                          FLASH
           Take off for where?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           God only knows -- whatever black
           corner of space this is coming from --
           wherever HE is!. -- we'll plunge
           into the devil's heart and destroy
           him! We'll die ourselves, of course,
           but our names will be honored till
           the end of time!
                         
                          DALE
           Look, Doc -- I don't book kamikaze
           tours -- never.
                         
          FLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off-
          balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE
          (DALE, ZARKOV)
                         
          It is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only
          on the exterior. There are some controls and displays, but
          in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed
          from conventional spacecraft as ZARKOV's solitary genius is
          from everyday science.
                         
          Immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity,
          ZARKOV waves the gun at FLASH.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Sit down there! Foot on the red pedal!
                         
                          DALE
           Flash! Sack him!
           12.
                         
          ZARKOV wheels and pulls the door shut. FLASH jumps him. He
          punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the
          well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again.
          Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch.
                         
          The capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out
          through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself
          was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's
          left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those
          LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy.
                         
          FLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms
          around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly
          increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster
          and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back
          against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh.
                         
          We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part
          of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted
          by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving
          as he speaks with enormous effort:
                         
           ZARKOV,
           Friendship...Built this to send to
           them in...Friendship...The end
           now...End of the world....Unless we
                          ····
           (every sound an effort
                          NOW)
           Unless...We...Three...Can...
                         
          ZARKOV'S eyes close. He loses consciousness.
                         
          EXT. GREENHOUSE - LONG SHOT (MINIATURE)
                         
          Totally ablaze within now, one huge fantastic jewel of fire.
          The whole central tower explodes outward. From the inferno a
          MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking
          up speed again as it ascends.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT
                         
          Whirling, whirling, invincibly unharmed by the LASER BOLTS
          which glance off it again and again, accelerating up into
          space.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT - POV
                         
          The EARTH recedes below into a ball, RED-HUED' under the
          fantastic sun. A fast approaching light FLARES up against
          the mirrored surface and is recognised as our MOON. It flashes
          past, follows EARTH into e distance. All around, the sky
          darkens into the void of space.
                         
          FANTASTIC MONTAGE - OUTER PLANETS OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
           13.
                         
          They hurtle past the capsule in rapid sequences:
                         
                         RED MARS
                         
          A sudden gauntlet of careening ASTEROIDS, all sizes, from
          tiny zingers to one almighty tumbler big as AFRICA.
                         
          Mammoth JUPITER with thirteen moons and its atmosphere of
          deadly methane clouds more than 1000 miles deep. The RED
          PATCH on its surface is a storm 20,000 miles across which
          has raged without intermission for 200 EARTH centuries.
          Through the RINGS OF SATURN in a dazzling LIGHTSTORM of
          blazing ice crystals.
                         
          NEPTUNE, PLUTO, outermost URANUS. One after another the
          planets are left hurtling behind, wheeling in their concentric
          orbits, the entire SOLAR SYSTEM dwindling into nothing.
                         
          EXT. A SPIRAL NEBULA
                         
          It tilts and wheels wondrously as the Capsule passes through
          the middle of it. Considering that this Nebula is probably a
          million light-years from edge to edge, we get some notion of
          the Capsule's speed.
                         
          EXT. A BLACK HOLE IN SPACE
                         
          Curving light-rays from another galaxy are drawn fantastically
          together and then simply DISAPPEAR as they are pulled in by
          the unimaginable gravitation force of is THING. we SEE the
          CAPSULE, tiny, curving, and spinning along amidst the mind-
          blowing display of light rays, sucked along with them ····
          then simply DISAPPEARING as it too enters the void.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT
          (KLYTUS, MING)
                         
          Visible again, gleaming in an AMBER GLOW. Suddenly a dancing
          grid of lines appears OVER IT, making us realise that we
          must be SEEING IT on some kind of screen. It BLURS out of
          focus, comes back again more sharply as some adjustment has
          apparently been made.
                         
          ECU - EYES OF MING THE MERCILESS
                         
          Deep in shadow, gleaming with evil amusement.
                         
          MONTAGE - ECU'S OF MING'S FACIAL FEATURES
                         
          Curve of lip, flare of nostril, fold of eyelid, gleam of
          shaven scalp, each a menacing landscape of sensual shadow as
                         WE HEAR:

           KLYTUS (O.S.)
           Hail Ming! Shall I drown them in
           the Sea of Fire?
                         
           MING (O.S.)
           Later, Klytus -- I think we will
           look at them first.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE - SHOOTING FROM WITHIN
                         
          Through the transparent walls as the spinning motion is
          rapidly SLOWING DOWN. The three voyagers are crumpled on the
          floor against the wall in strange attitudes, FLASH'S arms
          still holding DALE. They seem semi-conscious, as if dropped.
                         
          An AMBER GLOW bathes them, and soon we see its source. A
          huge planet wheels into view through the transparent wall.
          It is MONGO. Its curved surface is a pure sea of AMBER FIRE
          molten lava, with great tongues of flame erupting
          horrifically.
                         
          ZARKOV blinks, struggles to focus his eyes. He succeeds,
          with horror SEES where they are headed. Making a choking
          sound, ZARKOV stirs and tries to crawl over to a control
          panel. He pushes switches. Nothing happens. The CAPSULE
          keeps on going down. A great leaping tongue of fire licks
          it.
                         
          Suddenly, just as destruction seems imminent, the capsule
          miraculously changes its flight path and soars above the
          remaining flames.
                         
          It races through them. A shadow passes over MONGO as the
          CAPSULE passes through a wall of PURPLE VAPOR and emerges
          above a totally different landscape. A dozen VARIOUS COLORED
          CLOUDS sweep past in silent majesty.
                         
          The CAPSULE slows, hovers starts straight down into a sea of
          high grass.
                         
          EXT. MONGO -- GRASSY AREA - EVENING
                         
          In the distant B.G. against an extraordinary SUNSET SKY,
          rises the shimmering CITY OF MONGO.... a place of many levels,
          golden tiers and turrets, towers, flags and pennants. It is
          like something dreamed.
                         
          Several STRANGELY ARMORED MEN watch the MIRROR-BRIGHT CAPSULE
          descending slowly. The LEADER waves and they all start toward
          the CAPSULE.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE
          (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)
                         
          Gentle bump as the thing touches down.
           15.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           By God, we did it! We made it!
                         
                          FLASH
           Made it where, Doctor?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           I don't know.
                         
          Suddenly DALE gasps, reacting to something she SEES through
          the transparent-from-within wall. They all look around and
          SEE those STRANGE MEN approaching.
                         
                          DALE
           Don't. Suddenly I like it in here
           just fine --

          (ARMORED MEN, FLASH, LEADER, ZARKOV)
                         
          The door of the CAPSULE is opened from the inside. ZARKOV
          and DALE and FLASH get out. THE MEN stop. Long beat as the
          two parties gaze at each other, the first human eye ever to
          see an extraterrestrial being. FLASH walks up to the leader.
                         
                          FLASH
           Hello -- my name's Flash Gordon --
           can you understand me?
                          (SILENCE)
           We're from EARTH -- we come as
           friends.
                         
                          ZARKOV
                          (URGENT)
           Extend your hand! That's the gesture
           of friendship known everywhere!
                         
          With a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand.
                         
                          FLASH
           Hi!
                         
          CLACK! With lightning speed a manacle is slammed on FLASH'S
          wrist and he is thrown to ·the ground as other RED MEN advance
          to handcuff DALE and ZARKOV.
                         
                          LEADER
           You are prisoners. I will take you

          Groggily, FLASH lifts his head towards ZARKOV.
                         
                          FLASH
           Thanks, Doctor -- next time I'll

          Another strange glimpse through an opening. Some fierce
          tethered BEAST is being goaded and tormented by MONGO MEN,
          as in an Elizabethan bear-baiting. On the floor lies the
          tor n body of one MAN who apparently got too close.
                         
          DALE has one brief horrified GLIMPSE of this, then turns her
          head away and shuts her eyes as she's marched along.
                         
                          DALE

          INT. MAIN PALACE HALL
                         (ARMORED MEN)
                         
          A gigantic STATUE comes into view amidst topless columns at
          the end. Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns. As
          we come nearer, we SEE that this STATUE is cut out in the
          middle to form a throne.
                         
          MING THE MERCILESS sits in the throne niche, silent, gazing
          down on the PRISONERS as they are marched to a halt before
          him.
                         
                          ARMORED MEN
           Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without
           Mercy!
                         
          A hundred reduplicated ECHOES of that shout ring through
          unseen reaches of the palace. MING bends his head slightly
          in acknowledgement, points idly at the ARMORED MEN at the
          left of the group.
                         
          INT. PALACE OF HALLS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES
          (ARMORED MAN, AURA, DALE, FLASH, KLYTUS, LEADER, MING, VOICES,
                         ZARKOV)
                         
          As FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED
          MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces
           17.
                         
          bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable
          dimension.
                         
          We pass an archway opening into what seems to be an AMUSEME-
          NT ARCADE. Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic
          games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to
          unearthly music.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Fantastic -- into a Black Hole and
           out the other side -- to this. Who
           said Hans Zarkov was mad?
                         
                          DALE
           You're mad.
                         
          Look down over a balcony from a MOVING POV. A fencing glass
          is in session. SIX PAIRS OF MEN go at each other with magic
          swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the
          blades clash. Thrust, parry, SLASH! The head of one duellist
          EXPLODES in a bloodless fountain of fire.
                         
                          FLASH
           You got us into this -- HOW DO WE
           GET OUT?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Get out? Why? We're being taken to
           Ming -- getting at him is our only
           hope of saving EARTH. It's perfect!
                         
                          FLASH
           Dr. Zarkov, I'm about to show you
           what it feels like to be clipped by
           a New York Giant --
                         
                          DALE
           Flash, it's no use - he's too crazy!
                         
                          MING
           Step forward, Soldier.
                         
          The designated one marches two paces forward, halts.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           Are you loyal to Ming? Would you
           die for him?
                         
                          ARMORED MAN
           Gladly!
                         
                          MING
           Fall on your sword.
           18.
                         
          Instantly the ARMORED MAN pulls his sword, rips open his
          breast-plate, sets the sword hilt-down on the floor and
          PLUNGES FORWARD on to the fatal point.
                         
          With a little cry of horror, DALE shrinks back into FLASH'S
          arms.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           You inhuman fiend!
                         
                          MING
           Of course I'm "inhuman"! -- that's a
           compliment!
           (Dropping his voice)
           Pathetic Earthlings, forever wondering
           if you are alone in the universe --
           beaming you plaintive messages into
           to the void for anything that might
           hear you -- even hurling your bodies
           out into it -- and all without the
           faintest inkling of who or what is
           out here. If you had known anything --
           anything at all about the true nature
           of the universe, you would have hidden
           from it, in terror!
                         
          There is a low throaty LAUGH from the shadows. FLASH and
          DALE turn their eyes quickly in its direction.
                         
          FEATURE PRINCESS AURA
                         
          Emerging half into the light beside a column, fondling the
          head of an obscure BEAST slouching between her legs.
          Voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, AURA looks
          FLASH boldly up and down as the BEAST HISSES with the pleasure
          of her touch.
                         
          FLASH can't take his eyes off her. No normal man could. FLASH
          swallows with a dry throat as AURA'S gaze devours him. DALE
          gets the electricity going on, gives him a poke and WHISPERS
          LOUDLY.
                         
                          DALE
           Watch it, fella -- you came with me!
                         
          AURA laughs again, sidles up toward MING. We dimly SEE a
          couple of MUTANT CREATURES dragging away the lifeless body
          of the one who so vividly proved his loyalty.
                         
                          MING
           You know who Ming is now -- who are
           you and why do you come to Mongo?
           19.
                         
                          FLASH
           I'm Flash Gordon of the New York
           Giants this is Dale Arden -- Dr.Zarkov
           hijacked us in an effort to save
           EARTH.
                         
          MING looks questioningly at KLYTUS
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Sirs, Earth is the meaningless planet
           you are in the process of
           obliterating.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           (pouncing on that)
           In the process? You mean Earth still
           exists?
                         
                          MING
           For the moment -- not for much longer.
                         
                          FLASH
           But why? What in hell have we ever
           done to hurt you?
                         
                          MING
           You exist -- and yet you pay no homage
           to Ming! What greater crime can be
           committed?
                         
          The palace rings with an answering chorus: VOICES of all the
          ARMORED MEN and numerous others presently UNSEEN, including
          many WOMEN.
                         
                          VOICES
           Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without
           Mercy!
                         
                          MING
           Come closer, Dale Arden -- let me
           see you.
                         
          DALE doesn't move. MING takes a step down, narrows his eyes
          and gazes at her intensely. This guy's personal magnetism
          is enormous. As if irresistibly drawn, DALE steps forward.
                         
          MING moves his hand in a gesture. A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT
          bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard. DALE's lips
          open slightly, her color heightens, her rate of breathing
          increases. MING touches her flesh lightly.
                         
          FLASH tense, ready to spring.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           This woman will amuse you.
           20.
                         
                          ZARKOV
                          (INTERESTED)
           Klytus can see the future, eh?
                         
                          MING
           He can foresee it -- but for a few
           moments only. It gives him a unique
           gift for survival, -- and treachery.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Extraordinary. I'd like to study
           his beta factors -- I wager I could
           extend them with a course of
           telekinetic exercise.
           (peering at KLYTUS)
           Tell me -- when you use this fit
           does your temporal lobe prickle?
           Here?
                         
          MING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses
          the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN.
                         
                          MING
           Chain this one up. Preserve him for
           further examination.
                         
                          LEADER
           Hail, Ming!
                         
          ZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily
          as they drag the scientist away.
                         
                          FLASH
           Oh no you don't! We came together
           and we're STAYING together!
                         
          Languidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger.
                         
                          MING
           That one is useless to us. Remove
           him and kill him.
                         
          Shock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in
          front of her friend.
                         
                          DALE
           You dirty old bastard can kill me
           too!
                         
          CLOSE ANGLE - AURA
                         
          Wetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING:
           21.
                         
                          AURA
           Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him
           to me!
                         
                          MING
                          (EYEBROWS UP)
           What would your Prince Barin say?
                         
                          AURA
           I can handle Barin.
                         
                          MING
           Really, Aura -- your appetites are
           too monstrous -- even for our family.
           This could cause great trouble with
           Barin -- I must forbid it.
                         
          AURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she
                         WHISPERS AGAIN:
                         
                          AURA
           But you adore me, Father -- you ca
           refuse me nothing . Yes?
                         
                         WIDER SHOT
                         
          As MING steps quickly away from his super-provocative daughter
          and indicates DALE.
                         
                          MING
           Take the Earth-woman to our quarters!
           Bathe and annoint her for our
           pleasure!
                         
          A HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE.
                         
          FLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it
          DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she
          flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city-
          girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own
          prowess.
                         
                          DALE
           My God -- and I thought that book
           was another rip-off-
                         
                          FLASH
           Watch out! Behind you!
                         
          Three more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards
          DALE.
                         
                         QUICK ANGLES
           22.
                         
          FLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one.
          He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it
          quickly to knock cold the other two.
                         
          AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs
          her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth.
                         
          Panting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised
          mace.
                         
          Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the
          Cavernous space above.
                         
          To its tempo MING'S PERSONAL GUARDS now starts· appearing.
          They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing
          thing is that they all have the SAME FACE.
                         
          From left to right, back and front, the AMAZONS advance 0n
          FLASH and DALE. They do not attack, merely stun ad overwhelm
          us with their massive, silent, answerable threat.
                         
          FLASH swallows, looks this way and that, stands as if
          paralysed.
                         
                          DALE
           (low and tremulous)
           What's the play, Flash?
                         
                          FLASH
           I can't -- I just can't --
                         
                          DALE
           Can't what?
                         
                          FLASH
           Clobber a woman, Dale --
                         
                          DALE
                          (OUTBURST)
           You damn fool, those aren't women
           they're murderous AMAZON DYKES!
                         
          The AMAZONS are all around DALE now.
                         
                          DALE (CONT'D)
           Help!!
                         
          FLASH is paralyzed by indecision one beat more, then suddenly
          makes up his mind. He flies into action, SLAMS the nearest
          pair of AMAZONS.
           23.
                         
          INT. PALACE - FIGHT SEQUENCE
                         (DALE)
                         
          Fast and furious. Great havoc is wreaked by DALE and her
          karate, by FLASH and his flailing fists, but the AMAZONS'
          numerical superiority is of course decisive.
                         
          Soon FLASH is on the floor, pinioned by a dozen AMAZONS.
                         
          He looks up, with despairing eyes SEES poor DALE being dragged
          up a flight of stairs that disappear mysteriously into upper
          gloom.
                         
                          DALE
           Flash!!
                         
          The pitiful shout sends FLASH'S adrenaline rushing. With a
          superhuman effort, he fights free from the pile-up and dashes
          after DALE.
                         
          INT. PALACE - ON THE STAIRCASE
                         
          FLASH struggles to get through to DALE.
                         
          DALE claws fiercely at the bare AMAZON arms and shoulders
          that engulf her, reaches desperately back down for FLASH.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT - THEIR HANDS
                         
          Just touching their fingertips.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT - A STEP OF THE STAIRS
                         
          Opens like a yawning trap door UNDER FLASH'S FEET.
                         
          FLASH drops away with a YELL, in the very instant that AURA
          comes running INTO THE SHOT and boldly JUMPS after him.
          AURA is swallowed up too, a split-second before the trap
          door step CLOSES again after them.
                         
          INT. PALACE - CU-MING
          (KLYTUS, MING)
                         
          Watching that, as KLYTUS hisses into his ear.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           She betrays you! She'll take him to
           Aboria!
                         
                          MING
           So Prince Barin will kill Flash Gordon
           for me -- I don't care.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Don't be too sure!
           24.
                         
          MING glances at him, then back up the stairs at where DALE
          has vanished. His face softens, his tone turns museful!
                         
                          MING
           I haven't taken a wife in centuries.
           I could bring myself to marry this
           Dale Arden --
                          (A BEAT)
           What do you see in her future, Klytus?
                         
          NO reply. MING turns his head and finds that KLYTUS is gone.
          Vanished. Not particularly surprised or concerned, MING gazes
          again toward the top of the stairs and answers his own
          question with a licentious smile.
                         
          INT. A DARK METALLIC SHAFT - SHOOTING DOWN IT
          (AURA, FLASH)
                         
          It is seemingly endless, faintly lt by phosphoresence from
          below. We dimly make out the figures of FLASH and AURA falling
          away from us, far below, falling, falling. We HEAR Hollow
          echoing VOICES reverbrating up to us.
                         
                          AURA
           Take a deep breath! Grab my ankle
           after we hit the water -- I'll lead
           you!
                         
                          FLASH
           Hit what water?
                         
          In answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH.
                         
          INT. UNDERWATER (TANK)
                         
          FLASH plummets down, AURA right after him. Recovering balance
          in a universe of bubbles, FLASH finds himself confronting an
          enormous savage LUMINOUS FISH. Wheeling himself away in
          fear and revulsion, FLASH encounters AURA. He seizes her
          ankle as directed. Holding his beat, FLASH swims after her
          through a maze of stalagmites growing up from the cavern
          floor. AURA dives down, leads him OUT OF SIGHT through a low
          opening.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND GROTTO
          (AURA, FLASH, PLASH)
                         
          FLASH and AURA emerge from a pool of water. FLASH staggers
          across and collapses on a fringe of beach. For sure, AURA'S
          wet clinging robe doesn't make her look any less sexy. He
          stares at her.
                         
                          AURA
           Catch your breath -- then I'll take
           you up and find you a disguise.
           25.
                         
                          FLASH
           You're saving my life. How can I
           Thank you?
                         
                          AURA
           I'll fly you to the forest of Arboria -
           we'll find a way.
                         
                          FLASH
           Let's get one thing straight -- I've
           got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov
           too -- rescue them and try to save
           Earth too.
                         
                          AURA
           Do you realize how foolish you are
           to tell that to me -- Ming's daughter?
                         
                          FLASH
           I'm no good at lying.
                         
                          AURA
           You're funny -- are all Eathlings
           like you, Flash Gordon?
                         
                          PLASH
           I guess I'm about average.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR
          (AURA, FLASH)
                         
          There are windows on one side, emitting a fierce GLARE. FLASH
          follows AURA rapidly along. Suddenly he stops short, looking
          in through the tinted glass.
                         
          WHAT HE SEES - PLASMA CAVERN
                         
          An infernal place, chief feature of which is a LAKE OF
          SEETHING MAGMA that slowly rotates within a wide encircling
          platform. The platform is piled with GLOWING RADIOACTIVE
          GRAVEL, being shoveled into the magma by LIZARDMAN SLAVES
          who toil in rythmic unison.
                         
           FLASH (O.S.)
           What's that?
                         
           AURA (O.S.)
           The plasma core. It's e source of
           the energy-beam my father ia aiming
           at Earth. You can't stop it. Ming is
           merciless and all-powerful!
                         
          ANGLES - LIZARDMAN SLAVES
           26.
                         
          Showing ankle electrodes shackled to each SLAVE, so that
          those who collapse can be shocked back to their feet by GUARDS
          stationed on a surrounding catwalk above. Any SLAVE unable
          to rise is summarily pitched into the magma by HOODED MEN,
          waiting like executioners to perform this chore.
                         
           AURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           The slaves are Lizard Men. Once they
           had their own water Kingdom, the
           fairest of Mongo. Then they dared to
           rebel. They will suffer for it here
           forever.
                         
          FLASH looks at AURA again, then back in the window. He
          reacts.
                         
          INT. GROTTO - HIS POV IN CAVERN - ON A CATWALK
                         (AURA)
                         
          ZARKOV is being led along by SOLDIERS, heavily shackled. He
          stops, gazing in wonder at the seething lake, which FLARES
          UP BLINDINGLY with each shovel full of gravel.
                         
          FLASH and AURA
                         
                          AURA
           You can't reach him. If a soldier
           spots you, it's instant death! --
           Come!
                         
          AURA takes his hand. With one backward look toward ZARKOV
          who of course has not seen him, FLASH follows her.

           Incredible - the very core of this
           planet, is it not?
                         
                          SOLDIER
           We are but soldiers. We do not know.
                         
                          MING'S VOICE
           You guess well, Dr. Zarkov!
                         
          ZARKOV wheels in his chains, looks up.
                         
          INT. PLASMA CAVERN - MESSANINE
          (EVERYONE, MING, ZARKOV)
                         
          High above this place where MING stands with KLYTUS, lit by
          the infernal glare as he goes on:
           27.
                         
                          MING
           I am forcing this plasma through the
           successive nuclear phases of a star -
           building it toward the apocalyptic
           moment that will end Earth's pathetic
           history in one flash of fire.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Devil! Why don't you turn this science
           to peaceful use? The name Ming would
           be blessed instead of cursed.
                         
                          MING
           Bring him up to the dome, Soldiers --
           we wish to show him wonders.
                         
          At that instant a couple of worn-out SLAVES are pitched into
          the magma. Their dying SCREAMS are drowned by the chorus
          from all the minions:
                         
                          EVERYONE
           Hail! Ming! Hail, Great one Without

          INT. UPPER PALACE AREA - CORRIDOR
          (AURA, FLASH)
                         
          AURA leads FLASH out through a doorway. He is now fitted out
          with a fairly resplendent MONGO costume: boots, cape,
          headdress and all. They hurry along through shadows. Suddenly
          FLASH seizes her by the shoulders, stops her.
                         
                          FLASH
           Listen, where's he got Dale?
                         
          As she looks at him, she SEES a detachment of SOLDIERS
          marching this direction. Quickly she pulls FLASH into a niche,
          presses her body against his in the narrow space. WHISPERS:
                         
                          AURA
           Forget Dale Arden!

           I can't! I mean I hardly know her,
                          BUT --
                         
                          AURA
           Forget her, Flash Gordon: I saw a
           look in my father's eye -- I think
           he intends to marry her.
                         
                          FLASH
           What?? Marry her? What are you
           talking about??
           28.
                         
          The SOLDIERS have gone past, but AURA is still pressing
          against him.
                         
                          AURA
           Oh you ask so many questions.
                          (SEDUCTIVE)
           I'm taking you to people who'll help
           you. Trust me!
                         
                          FLASH
           Can I honestly?
                         
                          AURA
           Trust me!
                         
          AURA hauls FLASH from the niche, they hurry on a bit further.
          AURA stops in front of big doors, with glass windows in them.
                         
                          AURA (CONT'D)

          FLASH takes one look into the glass, then swivels back to
                         AURA
                         
                          FLASH

          INT. MING'S DOME
          (MING, ZARKOV)
                         
          Open at the top to space. But instead of our familiar pinpoint
          stars, here whole nebulae wheel in majesty against infinity,
          their innards popping with explosions as whole galaxies are
          born and die.
                         
          ZARKOV stands before MING in chains, mesmerized by fantastic
          devices on every side. Most prominent is a huge transparent
          cube, supported in the air above a control console. MING
          moves to that, plays in it like an organist. we HEAR a soft
          intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning
          on the top side of the dome.
           29.
                         
          An astonishing things happens. Inside the cube a recognisable
          greenish globe appears like a three-dimensional holograph,
          slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view
          below a veil of clouds.
                         
                          ZARKOV

           Yes, Zarkov -- as it was. Now as it
           will be, when my plasma reaches full
           force.....
                         
          A sudden TIDE OF FIRE sweeps the globe, Even the clouds BURN.
          ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys
          again.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           And as it will be in yet another
           time, long after you have died. Earth
           reborn! A pleasant image, no?
                         
          The fires recede. The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty
          just as it was except that the outlines of our continents
          have been subtly changed.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           But that's impossible! Even your
           perverted genius can't create new
           life!
                         
                          MING
           Of course I can create life. There's
           nothing easier. It only requires
           myself and one woman.
                         
                          ZARKOV
                          (SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING)
           Dale Arden.....
                         
                          MING
           Who else? As in that childish myth
           of yours -- Adam and Eve, wasn't it?
           I will breed with her and repopulate
           the Earth in my own image. I've
           already done it on over a thousand
           planets.
                         
          MING touches a key. The image of Earth DISAPPEARS from the
          cube. ZARKOV glares hatred at MING for a beat, then his eye
          catches something else.
                         
          WHAT HE SEES
           30.
                         
          A big block of crystal on the floor with two swords embedded
          in it, just their hilts sticking out.
                         
          ANGLE to include ZARKOV. Chained as he is, he suddenly bounds
          over and seizes a sword hilt, tries to pull it out. It doesn't
          budge.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           The magic blades are not for your
           kind, Zarkov. One is my own the other
           will only be withdrawn by my rightful
           heir. Pull on them with all your
                          MIGHT:
                         
          ZARKOV tugs desperately, but it doesn't give an inch. He
          falls panting over the block.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Monster!
                         
          MING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER.
                         
                          MING
           Return him to the dungeon.

          (DALE, HEDONIA)
                         
          DALE stands amongst the EXOTIC FEMALES of this lavish place,
          being gently but firmly divested of her clothes and put into
          a diaphanous gown. They intend her no harm. Though each has
          some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful.
                         
          Tickled, DALE can't suppress a giggle. The females are amazed
          and delighted by this phenomenon. They take turns poking at
          her ribs as tall HEDONIA glides up, bearing a flagon of green
          liquid.
                         
                          HEDONIA
           Drink this.
                         
          DALE recoils, her giggling cut short.
                         
                          DALE
           What is it -- some rotten drug?
                         
                          HEDONIA
           It has no name. But many brave men
           died to bring it across space from
           Cythera, planet of Pleasure. It
           will make your hours with Ming more
           agreeable.
                         
          With a karate chop, DALE- knocks the flagon away. HEDONIA
          rubs her hurt wrist but does not seem angry.
           31.
                         
                          HEDONIA (CONT'D)
           We are of different race, Dale Arden
           but we all are women here. I know
           your fears. Believe me, it will be
           better if you drink it...
                         
          HEDONIA retrieves the flagon from the silken pillow where it
          landed, extends it again to DALE. A shout!
                         
                          DALE
           Flash! Where are you??
                         
          Of course there is no answer. Sudden tears of despair spring
          from DALE'S eyes. She seizes the flagon and impulsively drinks
          it. Her expression changes.
                         
                          DALE (CONT'D)

          panel over which the pilot makes hand-movements to effect
          changes of course and attitude. FLASH is in the left-hand
          seat beside AURA, gazing down at the glittering sight.

          then reaches up and pulls down a curious gadget hanging above

          A couple of the FEMALES lift DALE'S hands, make a cup of

          LAUGH softly. Suddenly a FILTERED VOICE is HEARD from nowhere,

          A GUARD stands nearby against a wall, faceless in the shadow
          of a cowled uniform.

          knee.

          The GUARD catches his breath, steps toward her lecherously
          to accept the invitation. WHAM! He doubles up as DALE kicks
          him in the groin, goes down without a sound as a left-right-
          left series of KARATE CHOPS hits his neck.
                         
          He is hardly on the floor before DALE is pouncing on the key-

          (FLASH, TIGER MAN)
                         
          They run through the green tangle. FLASH trips over a vine.
          TIGER MAN picks him up.
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Thank you for freeing me.
           48.
                         
                          FLASH
           You can speak?
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           For all the good it does me.
                         
          SOUNDS echo: hunting horns, birdcalls of TREE MEN. They start
          running again.
                         
                          FLASH
           Have we a chance, Tiger Man?
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Only if we climb -- out of the green
           light -- to the sky -- Prince Barin's
           Tree Men can't follow us up there!
                         
                          FLASH
           What do you mean?
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Ming's Law -- outside his own kingdom,
           every hunter becomes the hunted!
                         
          Ahead is a huge tree made for climbing: branches stick out
          like the rungs of some great green ladder. They leap onto
          the lowest.
                         
          ANGLES - THE TREE - FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Climbing. Jack and the Beanstalk, up and up, panting, but
          there is never a top in sight. Suddenly the branches end.
                         
                          FLASH
           Damn. End of the line.
                         
          TIGER MAN reacts to something off. Touches FLASH'S shoulder
          and points.
                         
          THEIR POV - AT END OF LAST BRANCH
                         
          A crazy sort of ELEVATOR is going by. It's a moving. vine
          with LEAFY BASKETS attached, a vertical conveyor from the
          ground to above. As FLASH and TIGER MAN watch, they SEE one
          basket moving UP with an armed TREE MAN in it, scanning the
          forest below.
                         
                         FLASH
                         
          Snatches the crossbow off TIGER MAN'S back, cocks it, notches
          it quickly with a GLASS ARROW from the quiver.

          hearing the CLICK of the cocking. He wheels, looks up, SEES
          FLASH. Letting out a fierce BIRDCALL. he jumps up and swings
          his own crossbow just as FLASH shoots.
                         
          SWISH-PFFST as FLASH'S arrow hits him. ICE, he tumbles out
          of the basket.
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Run out along the branch, jump INTO the basket as it passes
          by.
                         
                          FLASH (CONT'D)
           How far will this take us?
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           I don't know --no man has ever been
           above the green.
                         
          EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE TREES
          (BARIN, FLASH, TREE MAN, TIGER MAN, TREE MAN LEADER)
                         
          BARIN and a troop of TREE MEN are poised in the branches,
          listening acutely. The one scouting in front calls back:
                         
                          TREE MAN
           The sight -- call came from the left!
                         
          TREE MA.i. The sight-call carne from the left:
                         
                          BARIN
           Up and across we'll cut them off!
                         
          He BLOWS his horn again. The TREE MEN start moving quickly
          some climbing, others SWINGING laterally on vines.
                         
          IN THE BASKET
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Rising looking upward, as the light through the leaves is
          changing, becoming less intensely green.
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           What is that color above?
                         
                          FLASH
           Blue. We call is blue.
                         
          A DOZEN TREE MEN come swinging into view on vines, land on a
          fat branch. The LEADER looks right in this direction, points
          and gives a chilling BIRDCALL. The TREE MEN unsling their
          crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS.
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
           50.
                         
          SEEING cold death staring them in the face.
                         
          FLASH reaches for an arrow, notches it.
                         
           TREE MAN LEADER
           You haven't a chance! Throw down
           your weapon!
                         
          FLASH makes like to throw his crossbow away. At the last
          instant, h swings it around, aims and FIRES.
                         
          TREE MEN ON BRANCH
                         
          Are startled as the arrow WHIRRS in and sticks into the branch
          under their feet. The branch instantly turns to ICE.
                         
          BARIN - CLIMBING FROM BELOW
                         
          HEARS a loud brittle CRACKING SOUND. He looks up, gapes,
          holds on tight to the tree trunk. A dozen SHRIEKING TREE MEN
          plummet down around him amidst chunks of ICE, crashing through
          the branches to doom. A look of fierce delight on his face,
          BARIN resumes his climb.
                         
          EXT. TREETOPS OF ARBORIA
          (FLASH, TIGER MAN)
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN jump from their basket into a wide leaf,
          near a loading platform where the elevator-vine goes around
          a great iron wheel. The forest is open to the sky at this
          altitude, a sunny Eden of huge exotic flowers. Enormous
          overlapping leaves form a floor FLASH and TIGER MAN can stand
          on.
                         
                          FLASH
           Which way to the border:
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Legend says Arboria ends in an ocean
           to the west.
                         
          FLASH quickly checks his wristwatch and the angle of the
          shadows, starts in the direction he estimates is west.
                         
          TREETOPS OF ARBORIA - OTHER ANGLES
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN running over the leaves, which are
          somewhat BOUNCY like a huge trampoline. It's quite enjoyable.
          FLASH laughs aloud at the sensation, takes a big jump off
          the edge of one leaf, BOUNCES HIGH from the next.
                         
          Amazingly, a fat TENDRIL seizes him in mid-air, coils around
          his waist. FLASH yells as he is lifted further up.
                         
          AN ENORMOUS FLOWER
           51.
                         
          is right above him. The closed petals open. The inside is
          viscous, hideous looking. In the deepest recess is a dark
          red blob which PULSES like a huge heart, emits a BEING SOUND.
          With horror, FLASH realizes the tendril is feeding him into
          the flower's maw.
                         
          PLASH struggles vainly against the tendril's strength. TIGER
          MAN dashes to his rescue below, but another tendril knocks
          him flat.
                         
          INT. FLOWER
          (BARIN, FLASH)
                         
          FLASH is conveyed INTO the flower. He punches wildly with
          his fists, kicks, but petals are CLOSING inexorably around
          him. On their inner surface are deadly spiny SPIKES.
          Scattered around are the crushed SKELETONS of luckless TREE
          MEN who have been fed in here.
                         
          SWISH-PFFFFST! Out of nowhere a GLASS ARROW comes flying
          past FLASH'S ear, sinks itself into the flower's heart. The
          flower SHRIEKS. All around, FLASH, it is turning into
          crystalline ICE.
                         
          The tendrils lose their grip, FLASH falls onto the leaf below
          beside the TIGER MAN.
                         
          TREETOPS - ANOTHER ANGLE
                         
          As FLASH turns his head to see BARIN standing with his
          crossbow on a leaf some twenty feet away.
                         
                          BARIN
           I saved you because your death must
           be mine.
                         
                          FLASH
           What's the point of all this killing?
           Why don't we team up and overthrow
           Ming?
                         
          BARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure
          raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart. Suddenly a SHADOW covers
          BARIN. He jerks his head up to SEE:
                         
          A WINGED SILHOUETTE
                         
          Diving from the sun at him. It is a HAWKMAN, magnificiently
          fierce. It seizes BARIN in its talons and lifts him INTO THE
          AIR.
                         
                         OTHER HAWKMEN
                         
          Hover, their wings beating the air. They dive on FLASH and
          TIGER MAN, lift them too.
           52.
                         
          EXT. SKY - AURA'S SPACECRAFT

          INT. COCKPIT - AURA
                         
          In the pilot's seat gazes OFF at something through tricky
          little binoculars.
                         
          WHAT SHE SEES - DISTANT HAWKMEN

          Put the binoculars down, with one hand lowers the THOUGHT
          TRANSFER hood over her head, with the other waves the craft
          into a sharp turn away from the HAWKMEN. Without her lips
                         MOVING:
                         
                          AURA'S VOICE
           Princess Aura returns to Mingo City
           The passage through the force-field
           opens at her approach --
                         
          AURA twists the tuning dial, then goes on in a soft
                         PROVOCATIVE TONE:
                         
           AURA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           Daddy darling -- am I with you? Are
           you getting me?
                         
          EXT. GRASSY AREA - ZARKOV'S CAPSULE
                         
          Sits some fanciful form of ground transport: perhaps a thing
          with bicycle wheels and sails.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE - ZARKOV AND DALE

          They are inside, she watching tensely as ZARKQV throws
          switches and eyes displays.
                         
                          DALE
           Will it fly?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Basic circuits seem okay.
                         
                          DALE
           It has-to fly! We gotta rescue FLASH
           from that vampire before she --
                         
          Sudden BLINDING BLUE LIGHT explodes within the capsule.

                          DALE
           What happened?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Heaven knows. I was just starting to
           test the primary transformer-banks
                          AND ----
                         
          ZARKOV stops abruptly, looking down at himself. DALE gasps.
                         
                          DALE
           My God -- your hands! Your hands
           are gone!
                         
          It is true: ZARKOV has no hands.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Not gone -- Just invisible. See?
                         
          INVISIBLE HANDS pick up a pebble from the ground, hold it
          before DALE'S nose. Magically, they toss the little object
          back and forth from one UNSEEN HAND to the other. DALE touches
          one, can feel it.
                         
                          DALE
           Does it hurt?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Not a bit. I believe Mongo's
           gravitational. field must have
           reversed the polarity of my generator
           so that --
                         
          He breaks off again. Slowly, in front of our eyes, ZARKOV'S
          HANDS are FADING IN, again and becoming VISIBLE. DALE whistles
          in amazement.
                         
                          ZARKOV (CONT'D)
           Neat trick. I wonder if it's
           controllable?
                         
          SHADOW over them suddenly. Great WHIRRING of wings. DALE
          Looks up and SCREAMS.
                         
                         HAWKMEN
           54.
                         
          Swoop down on ZARKOV and DALE, bear them aloft as they did
          with FLASH AND TIGER MAN.
                         
          INT. MING'S DOME ROOM

                         CU MING
                         
          In his wonderous DOME ROOM, watching something. PULL BACK.
          KLYTUS is beside him as usual. ANGLE to include the VIEWING
          SCREEN which MING is watching. On it is a directional
          continuation of the scene we just saw: a struggling DALE
          being Carrie dup into the open sky by HAWKMEN.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Mongo is restless today. Your vessels
           stray from their appointed
           kingdoms....
                         
                          MING
           That damned Vultan -- time I clipped
           his wings once and for all. We could
           put those insolent Hawkmen of his to
           work in the plasma cavern ----
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Dale Arden and Flash Gordon? Will I
           send out the Imperial Fleet to bring
           them back?
                         
                          MING
           We'll let Vultan tame her first --
           I'll look pretty to Dale Arden after
           him. Flash Gordon is nobody.
                         
          KLYTUS smiles that sinister way. MING looks at him
          questioningly.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Sire, it is not for me to tell Great,
           Ming that he is making mistakes.
                         
          EXT. SKY - WIDE SHOT
          (HAWKMAN, TIGER MAN)
                         
          Serried squadrons of HAWKMEN escort the ones bearing FLASH,
          BARIN and TIGER MAN through space.
                         
          CLOSER - TIGER MAN
                         
          Struggling against the TWO HAWKMEN who have him, snarling
          and roaring. He butts one in the belly with his horn.
                         
                          HAWKMAN
           Want us to let you go, et?
           55.
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Yes!!
                         
                          HAWKMAN
           Okay.
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Nooo!!!
                         
          SKY - WIDE PANORAMA
                         
          Light streams rough tremendous El Greco clouds. HAWKMEN Are
          tiny figures, rising against it.
                         
          Higher, higher. Above the clouds a blinding DAZZLE comes
          INTO FRAME. It resolves into a fantastic SKY PALACE hanging
          in mid-air, reflecting sunlight from myriad turrets and
          terraces. The HAWKMEN climb above it.
                         
                         CLOSER HAWKMEN
                         
          Carrying FLASH and BARIN and TIGER MAN , going into a
          screaming dive.
                         
          EXT. SKY PALACE - HAWKMEN POV
                         
          Rushing at us with horrifying speed. ZOOMING DOWN we see a
          dark opening. The wind howling around wings, we rush dizzingly
          into the aperture.
                         
          EXT. SKY PALACE - VULTAN'S EYRIE - A HIGH TERRACE
                         (DALE)
                         
          VULTAN circles admiringly around DALE. VULTAN is a lusty
          viking of the sky, winged like his men, one eye blinded, his
          beard cloven by an old scar from forehead to jaw. Gorgeous
          HAWKGIRLS watch jealously as VULTAN inspects DALE very
          closely, reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom. DALE
          slaps his hand away.
                         
                          DALE
           Watch out, you old bird -- Ming wants
           to marry me.
                         
          VULTAN hoots at that as HAWKGIRLS murmur. He's about to
          touch her again when there is a CLAMOR o.s. VULTAN reacts.
                         
          EXT. SKY PALACE - ANOTHER LEVEL
          (BARIN, DALE, FLASH, SARIN, VULTAN, ZARKOV, ZAAKOV)
                         
          HAWKMEN carrying FLASH, TIGER MAN and BARIN swoop OUT from
          another hole like the one they dove into. The whole place is
          like a great hanging birdhouse, HAWKWOMEN and HAWCHILDREN
          moving in and out and perching on the various exterior
          terraces.
           56.
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Are dropped on to a terrace, so hard it stuns them.
                         
                         BARIN
                         
          Is lowered more carefully on another terrace, this one
          grander, with a throne in the center.
                         
                         FEATURE VULTAN
                         
          Flying down from above, hovering above BARIN with menacing
          glee.
                         
                          VULTAN
           Ho! -- Barin! - I knew my Hawkmen
           would catch you one of these days.
                         
                          SARIN
           Be careful how you address me, Vultan.
           I am Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria.
                         
                          VULTAN
           Not in my Kingdom -- here you're
           just a stray animal to be killed for
           our sport!
                         
                          BARIN
           Will you do that, Vultan?
                         
                          VULTAN
           What would you do if you'd caught me
           in Arboria?
                         
                          BARIN
           Yes -- I would hunt you down and
           kill you without mercy.
                         
          FLASH on the OTHER TERRACE
                         
          Lifts his head groggily, reacts to something. ANGLE TO
          INCLUDE ZARKOV, stumbling out from an opening in his usual
          clothes.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Hello - we do meet in the strangest
           places.
                         
                          FLASH
           Where's Dale?
                         
                          ZAAKOV
           The boss-bird has her up in his
           57.
                         
          Sudden ear-piercing SCREAM from above. DALE'S scream, FLASH
          bounds to his feet.
                         
          IN THE EYRIE
                         
          DALE is surrounded by jealous HAWKGIRLS who are pushing her
          toward the terrace edge. Screaming again, DALE goes OVER.
                         
          SPACE BETWEEN TWO TERRACES/ ONE TERRACE
                         
          FLASH wheels toward the sound, dives to the parapet and
          catches DALE as she plunges past.
                         
                          DALE
           Flash! Oh darling!
                         
                          FLASH
           Dale baby!
                         
          He hauls her in and they embrace in a steamy kiss. FLUTTER
          of wings. HAWKMEN swoop at the terrace and LIFT UP the
          clinging couple. It barely interrupts their conversation:
                         
                          DALE
           Flash -- when I was in that tub --
                         
                          FLASH
           Yes -- it was me --
                         
                          DALE
           Did you mean it?
                         
                          FLASH

                          VULTAN
           No. What have you to say to Vultan,

          ANOTHER TERRACE - TIGER MAN
                         
          On his feet on the other terrace, shouting across:

           TIGER MAN (CONT'D)
           I know -- I'm only an ignorant Tiger
           Man -- but I tell you Flash Gordon
           is the leader we've waited for!
                         
          BACK TO VULTAN'S TERRACE
                         
          Where VULTAN gazes at TIGER MAN a beat, then turns mocking
          eyes on FLASH.
                         
                          VULTAN

           Well, back home it's what I'm paid

                          BARIN
           Not a word.
                          (LIKE ICE)
           I was hunting him when you seized
           me. Before you finish me. Vultan I
           beg only that you let me finish him.

          Razor sharp knives are POPPING UP from the top surface all
          over, maybe two feet apart. If a man loses his footing and
          falls he will surely be fatally impaled.

          his whip.

          Suddenly the fight begins. FLASH and BARIN stalk around,
          slipping on the grease, whamming at each other with their
          whips. The disc suddenly begins to TILT and SWAY, making
          this affair even more desperate.
                         
          BARIN begins to get an edge. Slashing, cutting, he drives
          FLASH back.

          He flies at BARIN, dodges the lash, grapples with him hand-

          They wrestle their way tot he very rim of the swaying tilting

          effort he flips BARIN over his back... over the edge!
                         
          In the same instant, FLASH dives onto his side amidst the
          deadly knives and grabs at BARIN'S wrist.

           order my men to suicide!
                         
          VULTAN ascends into the air. Hovers as he goes on:
                         
                          VULTAN (CONT'D)
           The flight brought me back to my
           senses -- good luck and goodbye.

           Thanks anyway for getting us this
           far!
                         
          VULTAN hesitates a moment, the soars away with determination.

          ZARKOV jumps out, leaving the door open. He crouches low.
          BARIN and VULTAN and EVERYBODY are watching.

          Interior of the capsule is filled with BLINDING BLUE LIGHT
          for an instant. ZARKOV pops up, sticks his head in.

                          ZARKOV (CONT'D)

           Look -- he still casts a shadow:
                         
          It's true. FLASH is totally invisible, but on the ground we
          SEE his shadow as he climbs out and stands upright.
                         
          Suddenly there is rising WHINING HUMMING SOUND that seems to
          fill the whole firmament. The earth trembles. LION MEN and
          TREE MEN cower in terror. TIGER MAN roars.
                         
                          BARIN (CONT'D)

           68.
                         
          The SOUND grows louder, intolerable. Brown smoking foliage
          rains down. EVERYONE looks up.

          The topless forest of Arboria is withering, falling apart.
          TREE MEN cry with primal fear as the SEE the sky revealed.
                         
          Hovering against the sun are the dark shapes of MING'S ROCKET
          SHIPS. PULSING RAYS emanate from projectors on their bottoms.
          A VOICE booms from heave:
                         
                          VOICE
           Prisoners of Ming, you are surrounded!

          ONE LION MAN
                         
          Howls in terror, makes a break for cover. A RAY instantly
          zaps down at him and he EXPLODES into fiery fragments.
                         
          BACK TO MAIN PART OF FOREST
                         
          A small SHUTTLE CRAFT descends vertically to a soft landing.
          KLYTUS gets out. Every sound ceases. He nods at BARIN, at
          ZARKOV. Looks around. Frowns. He walks directly across
          FLASH'S SHADOW, to ZARKOV.

           into the glaciers of Frigia.
                         
          DALE shuts her eyes, sobs out:
                         
                          DALE
           Oh Flash -- no -- you can't be dead --
           it doesn't make any sense --

           I don't believe you. You -- you

          Tear runs down AURA'S cheeks. She seizes DALE'S hand, presses
          it against her wonderful breast. DALE is really moved.
                         
                          DALE

           Ming tired of her. He blew my Mother
           into outer space. I look into the

           problems -- that bastard:
                         
          DALE embraces AURA. They cling to each other, bosom against
          bosom, in perfect womanly understanding. Golden CHORDS are
          heard. Doors open. AMAZONS enter.

          to an open doorway.

          WHAM! A left to the gut doubles him over to take an invisible

          TWO SOLDIERS stand with ray-guns before a heavy locked door.
          Suddenly INVISIBLE FLASH steps behind a flaring torch, casting
          an enormous SHADOW on the wall. He manipulates his caped
          arms so that the image becomes truly fearsome.
                         
                          FLASH'S VOICE

          FOUR SOLDIERS march along, two by two, filling the narrow
          way. SOUND OF RUNNING FEET coming towards them. They halt

          studying the pictures in the Mingo version of PLAYBOY

          ZARKOV, BARIN and TIGER MAN lie in chains, heads cocked at
          SOUNDS of the facas outside. THUD of a body falling, brief
          silence, then sound of a KEY IN THE LOCK.
                         
          The door opens itself.

          pairs, feet pressed out against the shaft walls. What makes
          it look even stranger, half of the FLASH-BARIN twosome is
          INVISIBLE. Low conversation as they pant and struggle up the

          Everyone watches a big hanging dial. Its needle quivers with

          CONTROLLERS twist the shock-knobs.
                         
          Tortured SLAVES howl in agony. Some drop and are thrown into

          ZARKOV and BARIN just look at him. TIGER MAN slumps out of
          his fighting stance.
                         
          Low door at the back opens itself and INVISIBLE FLASH comes

          A magnificent wedding is on. DALE marches slowly up the
          middle, on KLYTUS'S arm, helped along by AMAZONS who march
          at her back with spears. Her long train passes between the
          AMAZONS to be borne behind by LOVELY GIRLS, as the party
          passes between ranks of splendidly garbed MONGONS.
                         
          An aged HIGH PRIEST waits at the throne-altar with MING,
          whose eyes lecherously devour his approaching bride.

          Earth turns slowly in mid-air, its seas and continents veiled
          by clouds of hideous smoke which seethe with flashes of
          interior red lightning.
                         
          Then FACES come INTO FOCUS below and behind it, and we realise
          we are in MING' S GREAT HALL, where EARTH is a holographic
          image in a transparent box above the altar-throne.

          despairingly at her beloved planet while the HIGH PRIEST
                         INTONES:
                         
                          HIGH PRIEST
           Do you take her, this Earthling,

          KLYTUS produces a golden ring, hands it to MING.
                         
          MING takes DALE'S left hand, forces it up into position,
          holds the ring poised to slip it on. MING'S face has never
          been more merciless.

          KLYTUS twists away, knocks BARIN'S sword out of his grasp,
          drives BARIN back against the wall. KLYTUS lifts his own
          sword, puts it at BARIN'S throat for the final thrust.

 Four Feathers Screenplay by Michael Schiffer revised by Hossein Amini based on the book by A.E. Mason EXT. TRAINING GROUND/ WESTMINSTER barracks/ LONDON - Day. Through a veil of dust we see two lines of uniformed cavalry, stretched out across the parade ground. There's a tense silence except for the occasional flourish of hooves. A horseman steps out of each line. LIEUTENANTS HARRY FEVERSHAM and JOHN DURRANCE face each other across the wide expanse. Already we feel the keen sense of competition between them. DURRANCE raises his sabre first. His horse sets off at a slow trot. His troops follow in perfect time. HARRY waits a moment, then raises his own sword. A sea of sabres rises up in response. The two lines approach each other at a steady canter. A smile of anticipation lights up DURRANCE's face. He's a born soldier, enjoying himself. HARRY looks more nervous. He's not as easy as Durrance in the saddle. It's a skill he's acquired over the years rather than been born to. DURRANCE seems to sense Harry's doubt. With a loud whoop he kicks his horse into a gallop and points his sabre forwards. His troops echo his war cry and descend on the opposing line at speed. HARRY checks his troops and responds. The two lines bear down on each other, hooves thundering, sabres pointed. DURRANCE charges recklessly. His eyes are fixed on Harry all the time. HARRY holds his gaze, but doesn't look as sure of himself. He's thinking too much, trying too hard. His horse senses it and slows a fraction. The troops behind him lose their cohesion as they draw level. DURRANCE sees the momentary lapse and waves his men on at full tilt. They pass through HARRY's troops in a perfect line, panicking their mounts, cheering triumphantly. HARRY's formation loses its shape. There's no doubt who's won the drill. DURRANCE wheels his horse around and grins at HARRY through the clouds of dust. CREDITS ROLL. INT. Changing room/ WESTMINSTER BARRACKS - day. Moving through clouds of steam we see the CAVALRY OFFICERS washing themselves in wooden bathtubs. There's a din of voices, soldiers re-living the day's drill, those on Durrance's side still crowing over their victory. DURRANCE walks with his arm around HARRY. With them is another friend, LIEUTENANT TRENCH, a squat bull of a man. DURRANCE ...How many does that make it Harry? harry It's not something I count. DURRANCE How many Trench? harry Trench can't count. TRENCH grabs HARRY in a neck hold. He lets go as he spots another friend of theirs, LIEUTENANT CASTELTON, sitting in a bathtub, staring out. TRENCH sneaks up on CASTELTON, and ducks his head under the water. CASTELTON comes up, spluttering. He reaches for a bar of soap and hurls it after TRENCH. CASTELTON ...Idiot. INT. WILLOUGHBY's rooms/ barracks - day. A fifth friend, LIEUTENANT WILLOUGHBY, stares at himself in the mirror. His hair like his uniform is perfect. There's a loud knocking on his door. trench o/s ...Miss Willoughby, Miss Willoughby we're waiting. WILLOUGHBY finally stops preening himself as he hears his friends picking the lock. He gets up reluctantly, taking one last look at his reflection in the mirror. EXT. BARRACK GATES/ LONDON STREET - DAY. The OFFICERS pour out of the barrack gates in full regimental unifom, a sea of gleaming red. We pick out HARRY, DURRANCE, TRENCH, WILLOUGHBY, and CASTELTON, laughing amongst themselves, taking turns to tease each other, inseperable. INT. carriage/ HAnsom cab/ london streets - day. The friends share a flask of whisky as they sit in the back of the carriage. WILLOUGHBY passes it on without taking a sip. harry Who are you planning to impress tonight? trench (Grinning) Anna What's-her-name. DURRANCE Anna What's-her-name's father more like. Don't think we're going to take you any more seriously when you're promoted. wILLOUGHBY (Quietly confident) We'll see about that. A chorus of mocking 'ooohs' from the others. TRENCH notices CASTLETON staring out of the window. trench What's so interesting about a London street? CASTELTON (Reflecting) Ask me that when we're in Bombay. TRENCH rolls his eyes and turns to DURRANCE. treNCH Is Ethne going to be there? We catch a hint of shyness in DURRANCE at the mention of Ethne's name. DURRANCE I think so. HARRY watches DURRANCE, a little uncomfortably, as if he's holding something back. EXT. PARTY/ india office building/ london - night. CARRIAGES line the entrance to the India Office. INDIAN VALETS in turbans and robes escort the GUESTS to the entrance, holding umbrellas over them. The five friends crowd under a single umbrella. WILLOUGHBY makes sure he's in the middle, he doesn't want to get his uniform wet. TRENCH nudges him into the rain. INT. The Durbar court/ party/ INDIA office - night. Palm trees and fountains dominate the room. The ladies are dressed in ballgowns, the Officers in regimental colours. The full pomp and ceremony of Empire is on display. HARRY, DURRANCE, WILLOUGHBY, CASTELTON and TRENCH have gathered by the bar, a little overawed by the occasion. trench (Admiring the passing women) I'm going to ask someone to dance. willoughby (Admiring the passing Generals) You said that ten minutes ago. trench I'm waiting for Castelton. CASTELTON stares at the ARISTOCRATIC WOMEN, paralysed with shyness. trench (Pouring him another drink) ...Just look dreamy. I'll do the talking. DURRANCE smiles as he listens to them. He turns to HARRY. DURRANCE Can you see Ethne? harry Not yet. HARRY seems uneasy again. We sense there's something on his mind, something he wants to tell Durrance. DURRANCE doesn't pick up on it. He finishes his whisky and looks back into the throng. WILLOUGHBY Harry, your father... HARRY looks away from DURRANCE. He sees his father, GENERAL FEVERSHAM, shaking hands with some COLLEAGUES across the room. INT. seating area/ durbar court/ india office - night. GENERAL FEVERSHAM is deep in conversation with his friend, COLONEL SUTCH, a fellow veteran of the Crimean war. HARRY moves discreetly into their field of vision. GENERAL FEVERSHAM (His face lighting up) Harry... Immediately we feel the bond between father and son. harry (Greeting Colonel Sutch) How are you Colonel? COLONEL SUTCH Fine Harry. Relieved to see a few familiar faces. When are you boys shipping out? harry Next month. COLONEL SUTCH Your father and I served in Bombay. There are worse places they could have sent you. harry Yes Sir. HARRY smiles politely. SUTCH is sensitive enough to see that his mind is on other things. He lets father and son talk. GENERAL FEVERSHAM Is Ethne here? HARRY Not yet. They both smile, as if they share a secret. GENERAL FEVERSHAM reaches out and straightens his son's collar, trying to make him look as presentable as possible. INT. dance area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. TRENCH and CASTELTON are dancing with two GIRLS: TRENCH waltzing boisterously, CASTELTON taking it all very seriously. INT. another area/ durbar court/ india office - night. WILLOUGHBY has found a place amongst a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. He stands next to COLONEL HAMILTON, the Commander of their regiment. COLONEL HAMILTON ...If I had a choice we'd be on our way to the Sudan. Deal with this Dervish uprising once and for all. 2nd colonel You prefer a tour in the Sudan to India Willoughby? wILLOUGHBY I don't know about that Sir, but I agree with Colonel Hamilton, we're going to have to fight the Mahdi sooner or later. WILLOUGHBY trails off, leaving COLONEL HAMILTON to continue. INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. DURRANCE downs another whisky. He looks less sure of himself in this social whirl than he did in the barracks. A few WOMEN cast admiring glances in his direction but he doesn't notice them. His eyes keep searching the crowd for Ethne. INT. seating area/ durbar court/ india office - night. HARRY gazes through the crowd at DURRANCE. DURRANCE catches him staring and raises a glass. The two friends smile at each other. INT. STAIRWAY/ india office - night. A group of late arrivals hurry up the stairs towards the party. ETHNE EUSTACE, is several steps ahead of her father DERMOD, and her friend, CAROLINE ADAIR, a young widow in her 30's. INT. ENTRANCE/ durbar court/ india office - night. ETHNE's eyes search the crowd as soon as she walks through. She stops as she sees DURRANCE at the bar. Her eyes stay on him a moment, but it's only to see if Harry's nearby. When she realises he isn't she looks away. Finally she sees him, standing with GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH. She takes her father DERMOD's hand, and leads him in their direction. INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. CASTELTON and TRENCH are back at the bar, arguing. CASTELTON Your sole purpose in life is to annoy me. trench She couldn't see me. CASTELTON I could see you. I can see you everywhere I look. Pulling those stupid faces at me. willoughby Now Ladies. DURRANCE joins in the laughter but he seems distracted. He takes another gulp of whisky and looks around the crowd. His eyes stop as he sees ETHNE. A smile lights up his face, but it's short lived. Across the courtyard HARRY appears, greeting ETHNE. Their hands touch briefly. The noise fades in DURRANCE's head. He stares in silence. HARRY shakes DERMOD's hand warmly. DERMOD slaps him on the back, as if he's congratulating him. DURRANCE's eyes take in the smallest details now. Even though he can't hear a word, the scene before him reveals itself more and more clearly. COLONEL SUTCH raises his glass. GENERAL FEVERSHAM, DERMOD, and CAROLINE ADAIR respond. HARRY and ETHNE move closer, a little coyly, as if the toast is for them. DURRANCE looks pale. We feel the disappointment in his eyes as he realises what's happened. HARRY's arm moves around Ethne's waist, a libery that can only mean they're engaged. INT. fountain area/ durbar court/ india office - night. HARRY and ETHNE glance at each other tenderly. ETHNE Did you tell them? harry I was waiting for you. ETHNE Not even Jack? harry Not even Jack. The two of them look towards DURRANCE for the first time. INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. DURRANCE looks up as ETHNE and HARRY make their way through the crowd. He gathers himself, and walks towards them, concealing his feelings: DURRANCE Congratulations. harry How did you know? DURRANCE Nothing escapes me Harry... (Kissing ETHNE on both cheeks) I'm delighted for you both. ETHNE Harry wanted to tell you before anyone else. It's my fault. I asked him to wait. DURRANCE I'll still blame him. hARRY (Relieved that his friend's taking it so well) You were the one who introduced us. DURRANCE Did I? I'll be more careful next time. DURRANCE takes HARRY in his arms, slapping him on the back. WILLOUGHBY, TRENCH, and CASTLETON appear behind them, realising something's up. DURRANCE turns to them, beaming: DURRANCE Three guesses for Trench, one for everyone else. The friends let out a cheer as they realise what's happened. They crowd HARRY and ETHNE, congratulating them. INT. DANCE area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. TRENCH sweeps HARRY and ETHNE towards the dancefloor. trench (As if they have to dance in public as a punishment) ...Over there. Where we can see you. And remember you're not married yet. HARRY takes ETHNE in his arms. harry (Smiling ironically) Alone at last. TRENCH claps loudly as they dance. CASTLETON looks embarrassed by his friend. Behind them WILLOUGHBY congratulates DERMOD and GENERAL FEVERSHAM. INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. DURRANCE watches the celebrations from the bar. He's smiling to himself, but it's the glazed smile of someone who's forcing himself to be happy. A quiet voice interrupts him: CAROLINE o/s Wonderful news isn't it? DURRANCE turns around to see CAROLINE, Ethne's friend, gazing at him. DURRANCE (Smiling automatically) Yes it is. CAROLINE Had Harry told you? DURRANCE I knew it was just a matter of time. (Changing the conversation) What can I get you to drink? CAROLINE Nothing thank you. DURRANCE (Nervous under her gaze) I'd ask you to dance, only I'm not sure how steady I am on my feet. CAROLINE (With the quiet confidence of an older woman) I'd love to dance. DURRANCE grins sheepishly, at a loss, as he is with most women. INT. DANCE area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. The waltz is in full swing. All the friends are out on the dance floor. TRENCH spins his GIRL around energetically, exchanging glances with other women as they pass. CASTELTON stares into his partner's eyes, already in love. WILLOUGHBY dances with an elderly WOMAN, probably some General's wife. DURRANCE waltzes with CAROLINE, avoiding her meaningful glances, looking over her shoulder for Harry and Ethne. EXT. PARTY/ india office building/ london - night. The rain pours in torrents. HARRY and ETHNE stand in the shadows of the building. Harry tries to kiss her and hold an umbrella over her at the same time. ETHNE What if I hold the umbrella? harry I'd have to kneel. ETHNE Nothing wrong with that. HARRY hands her the umbrella, bending under it. ETHNE (With irony as he kisses her more and more passionately) You're very distant tonight. harrY I'm locked in a barracks room all day. ETHNE What are you going to do in India? harrY Take you with me. ETHNE A Hindu wedding? harry Why not. ETHNE Not on your life. She walks away with the umbrella, leaving him exposed in the rain. ETHNE I want the full works. The Church near my home. A long speech from you. An entire regiment crossing swords. harry (Drenched) Done. ETHNE I don't believe you. HARRY makes a rush and grabs her, eneveloping her in his arms. ETHNE You're soaking wet. HARRY Whose fault is that. ETHNE squirms but loses herself in his embrace. As they start to kiss they're suddenly interrupted by TRENCH's braying voice in the distance. trench o/s (A regimental song) Goodnight, Ladies...goodnight, Ladies...goodnight, Ladies, we hate to see you go... HARRY shakes his head in despair. TRENCH, castelton, willoughby and durrance together o/s Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along...Merrily we roll along, until the morning comes... ETHNE smiles. ETHNE Duty calls. HARRY feels the quiet regret in her voice. harry We've two days leave before we sail. Once I tell them we're engaged I'm sure they'll give me more. ETHNE As long as you promise to make me miserable. Argue with me all the time so I don't miss you a bit. Her lightness is forced. harrY You'll be fine. ETHNE You don't have to reassure me. I'm a soldier's daughter. Everything under control. harry I've never kissed a stiff upper lip before. TRENCH's VOICE bellows out again as they kiss: trench o/s Goodnight, Ethne's...goodnight, Harry's...Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight... HARRRY and ETHNE ignore him, the rain falling all around them. INT. REGIMENTAL HALL/ WESTMINSTER BARRACKS - night. The regimental song turns into a deafening roar. All around the mess hall, OFFICERS are laughing and banging on tables. HARRY and DURRANCE stand on wobbly stools, downing pints of beer. As soon as their glasses are empty they set off down the hall at a sprint. It's an obstacle course. The two friends duck under two long tables, and crawl on their bellies, towards two more glasses. TRENCH and CASTELTON are busy laying bets on who'll win. DURRANCE and HARRY step over a bridge of chairs. They have to find a pint of beer hidden under one of them. DURRANCE finds his first. TRENCH looks at CASTELTON smugly, convinced he's going to win. HARRY and DURRANCE step-walk over two long benches. DURRANCE falls off. HARRY overtakes him. He throws his head back and finishes off another pint. CASTELTON stands up, cheering. HARRY and DURRANCE are level as they reach the last glass. As they start to drink HARRY stops, spluttering. harry This isn't beer, it's whisky. trench Down in one! HARRY drinks again, but he's fallen behind. The pint of whisky disappears down DURRANCE's throat. Grinning, he makes his way towards the finish line. HARRY pours the whisky over his head, conceding defeat. EXT. TRAINING GROUND/ WESTMINSTER barracks/ LONDON - Day. An obstacle course of a different kind. The CAVALRY are training, galloping at full tilt, HARRY and DURRANCE bringing up the front. At the sound of a bugle, they dismount their horses, and sprint towards a row of bayonets. They snatch up the weapons and charge a row of dummies. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...In. Out. On guard... The blades tear into the dummies, exposing soft leaves and hard wood. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...Hold the line...and charge... The OFFICERS charge towards a second set of targets. Teeth bared, they drive their bayonets into the stuffed dummies. CASTELTON's blade sticks in a chunk of wood. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...In and out, Castelton, in and out... CASTELTON pulls in frustation. He can't get the bayonet loose. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...They're coming at you boy. Rip it out or they'll stick you first. CASTELTON puts his foot on the dummy's head and tries to wrench the blade free. Even though it's only a training exercise, his panic is real. TRENCH slows down as he watches his friend struggling in vain. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...Move on Trench. Castelton's dead. Enemy spear through his throat. The OFFICERS continue, bayonets thrust forward, leaving the struggling CASTELTON behind. EXT. STABLES/ training ground/ westminster barracks - day. The men are washing up after exercises, dousing themselves with cold water. Everyone's teasing CASTELTON, except for TRENCH. For once he keeps quiet, knowing how hard his friend's taking it. A SEARGENT-MAJOR enters and salutes. SERGEANT-MAJOR Gentlemen... fifteen minutes, in the briefing room. As he leaves, the MEN look at each other curiously. INT. BRIEFING ROOM/ westminster barracks - day. The Officers are assembled. HARRY, DURRANCE, TRENCH, WILLOUGHBY, and CASTELTON, take their places on the wooden benches. As he sits HARRY notices a map of Africa behind Colonel Hamilton. COLONEL HAMILTON ...Gentlemen... (when the room settles down) The 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards have been ordered to forego their posting to India... (Off murmurs of surprise) ...We ship out in three days, to establish a forward garrison in the Sudan... There's a buzz of excitement. COLONEL HAMILTON can hardly contain his smile. He turns to GENERAL HOLMBY: COLONEL HAMILTON ...General Holmby, Sir. GENERAL HOLMBY, a severe looking military man, stands and faces the OFFICERS. Their eyes are lit-up with anticipation, all except Harry, who stares ahead, slowly turning inward. GENERAL HOLMBY ...I'd like to apologise for not giving you men more notice. I know many of you will find it hard to see your families now. Unfortunately we had no alternative... He turns to the map and points out the Sudanese desert. gENERAL HOLMBY ...Three days ago, an army of Egyptian reserves led by General Hicks, was ambushed at Tashgil by the Mahdi's forces. Upoun attack the Egyptians fled, leaving General Hicks and the British Officers with him, to fight a heroic, but in the end hopeless rearguard action. All of them died, sword in hand... HARRY stares out silently, his whole world turned upside down. geNERAL HOLMBY ...I hesitate to call this a mission of vengeance, but the honour of our country is at stake. This Government has finally seen fit to send its own troops to war... There's loud cheering from the men now, regimental pride and bravado covering any trace of nerves. EXT. COURTYARD/ westinster barracks - sunset. The OFFICERS pour out into the courtyard, still exhilirated by the thought of seeing war. We hear TRENCH's voice rising above the others. trench ...I wish I had more than one life to give for my country. Two would make me feel a lot safer. HARRY laughs with the others, hiding his mounting anxiety. INT. HARRY and DURRANCE's ROOM/ BARRACKS - NIGHT. Laughter filters into Harry and Durrance's room. The two of them lie in their beds, watching the embers die out in the fireplace. DURRANCE (Gazing up at the ceiling where the noise is coming from) ...I listen to them laugh, and I can't help wondering which ones won't be coming back. The worse part is I think I even know who they are. haRRY Am I one? DURRANCE Of course not Harry. You're one of the lucky ones. Always have been. HARRY picks up the reference to Ethne but doesn't say anything. More laughter filters through. HARRY stares out in the darkness, tormented. DURRANCE What are you thinking? harry (Hesitating) I'm wondering what a Godforesaken desert in the middle of nowhere has to do with her Majesty the Queen. DURRANCE Ask Willoughby. He's on the Colonel's staff. harry I know what he'll say: 'It's not for us to question.' (A beat) Do you ever ask yourself why you're going? DURRANCE Not for the Queen. I hardly know her. (He smiles softly) Nor for the regiment. There isn't much of a military tradition in my family... (A beat) I suppose I'm going because you're going. You, and Trench, and Castelton, and Willoughby... (A big grin) Not much of a reason I know, but it reassures me. HARRY smiles, but Durrance's words only make him feel more ashamed of the fear he feels inside. harry Is there anything that frightens you, Jack? DURRANCE I'm frightened of not coming back in one piece. Much more than dying. I wouldn't know what to do with myself in a wheel chair. And I couldn't stand to be pitied. He puts the thought out of his head and grins. DURRANCE There's a Church near our house. Next to the pub. Every night at ten the drunks spill out, shouting at the top of their voices. That's where I want to be buried. Where I can hear them. harry Nothing's going to happen to you. DURRANCE It's out of our hands anyway. Might as well sleep easy... DURRANCE rolls on his side. HARRY looks back at the fireplace, as the last embers fade. EXT. REGIMENTAL COURTYARD - dawn. A cold blue light hangs over the barracks. The courtyard is empty, except for a few sentries on duty. Wagons pull in, loaded with supplies. INT. HARRY and DURRANCE's ROOM/ BARRACKS - dawn. HARRY buttons his uniform. He looks as if he hasn't slept. He turns to DURRANCE. His friend is still asleep. HARRY hesitates. He wants to wake him up, and talk, but in the end he turns away, and leaves the room. EXT. regimental COURTYARD - dawn. Harry walks slowly toward the Regimental Office. He glances up at the Regimental flag, flying beside the Union Jack. INT. ADCs' ROOMS/ THE REGIMENTAL OFFICE - dawn. WILLOUGHBY looks up from his desk as HARRY walks in. willoughby (Grinning) ...Harry. You're up early. HARRY smiles awkwardly but doesn't say anything. WILLOUGHBY senses something's wrong. willoughby (Concerned) ...What's the matter? HARRY looks at him for a moment, but then turns to Colonel Hamilton's other AIDE-DE-CAMP. HARRY I'd like to see the Colonel please. WILLOUGHBY stares in confusion. The AIDE-DE-CAMP disappears into the next door office. HARRY still can't bring himself to look at his friend. willoughby Harry, what's wrong?... He's interrupted as the AIDE-DE-CAMP walks back in. AIDE-DE-CAMP The Colonel will see you, sir. harry Thank you. HARRY walks into Hamilton's office. WILLOUGHBY stares after him, bewildered. INT. COLONEL HAMILTON's office - day. COLONEL HAMILTON glances at the letter HARRY has just given him. He stops reading after only a few words. COLONEL HAMILTON What the hell is this? HARRY My papers, sir. I wish to resign my commission. COLONEL HAMILTON doesn't appear to understand. He looks back at the piece of paper, as if he's misread something. COLONEL HAMILTON If it's leave you want, there's a different procedure. Normally I wouldn't consider it in the circumstances, but given you've got engaged... HARRY (Interrupting politely) I don't want any leave Sir. I wish to resign my commission. A long silence. COLONEL HAMILTON calmly puts the letter aside, and returns to his work, ignoring HARRY. harry Sir... COLONEL HAMILTON It's nerves. We all have them. HARRY Sir, I've made up my mind. COLONEL HAMILTON And I'm asking you to reconsider. HARRY I have considered, sir. And I've decided to leave the service. COLONEL HAMILTON Come back to me when you've discussed it with your father. HARRY It's not his decision, sir... HAMILTON explodes, all his repressed fury pouring out. COLONEL HAMILTON I do not accept these "papers," Lieutenant -- and do not accept that one of my men -- the son of a man with whom I was honored to serve -- would walk out on his Regiment -- HARRY Sir -- COLONEL HAMILTON -- on the very eve we're shipping off to war! (holding out the papers) Take these back! HARRY I will not, sir. Dead silence. harry I wish to resign my commission. HAMILTON stares at HARRY for what seems an eternity. He's struggling to make sense of something beyond his comprehension. Slowly he gathers himself and lowers his eyes, looking down at Harry's papers: COLONEL HAMILTON Very well. Then as the coward and disgrace you are, you may take yourself out of my office... (Signing Harry's papers) Please leave the barracks at once. You're belongings will be sent on. Face drained of color, Harry turns and leaves. INT. ADCs' ROOMS/ THE REGIMENTAL OFFICE - dawn. As the door opens, WILLOUGHBY stares at HARRY, speechless. HARRY lowers his eyes and walks on. INT. STAIRWAY/ BARRACKS - DAwn. HARRY walks down the stairway, gripping the bannisters. Two SOLDIERS salute him on their way up, but he doesn't respond. EXT. regimental COURTYARD - dawn. The supply wagons are being unloaded in the courtyard. HARRY walks between more SOLDIERS, his eyes fixed on the barrack gates. The only sound he hears in his head is the gentle flapping of a flag. INT. TRENCH and CASTELTON's ROOM/ BARRACKS - day. CASTELTON is packing his trunk, neat and fastidious, taking his time over every item. TRENCH waits for him impatiently. trench ...Why can't you do this after breakfast? We're not leaving till tonight. CASTELTON ignores him, folding his shirts. TRENCH turns to DURRANCE, exasperated. trench He packs three bibles. Can you believe it? Three bibles... DURRANCE grins. He glances up as WILLOUGHBY enters. DURRANCE ...Field Marshall Willoughby... WILLOUGHBY doesn't smile. He looks ashen faced. DURRANCE ...What's the matter? CASTELTON and TRENCH look up. willoughby It's Harry... (He still can't believe it) He's resigned. trench Resigned what? willoughby (Snapping at Trench) His bloody commission. What do you think?! There's a long silence. No-one knows quite what to say. DURRANCE finally speaks. DURRANCE What did Hamilton do? Refuse him leave? willoughby Hamilton didn't do anything. Harry went to see him of his own accord. Right after they changed our deployment. CASTELTON looks at TRENCH, as the insinuation sinks in. trENCH ...It's just a coincidence. He's having second thoughts about leaving Ethne. willoughby He was happy to leave her behind when we were going to India. No doubts then. DURRANCE (Jumping to Harry's defence) What's that supposed to mean? willoughby You tell me. He resigns his commission the very day we're sent to war. DURRANCE Harry's the best soldier in this regiment. wILLOUGHBY Obviously not when it counts. DURRANCE Why don't you say that to his face. CASTELTON (Intervening) We don't know the circumstances yet. (Reasoning with Willoughby) I think we should give Harry a chance to explain. willoughby (Bitterly) Harry's gone. He left this morning. Whilst you were all asleep. WILLOUGHBY turns away in frustration. He's as upset as the others, but he shows it in anger. TRENCH and CASTELTON look stunned. DURRANCE stares ahead in silence. trench Did he say anything to you, Jack? DURRANCE (Quietly) No. Nothing. DURRANCE remembers his conversation with Harry the previous night. WILLOUGHBY An action like this dishonors the entire Regiment. DURRANCE (Suddenly venting his anger on Willoughby) Will you forget about your bloody Regiment for once! WILLOUGHBY Alright then, it dishonours us! He stares at DURRANCE with conviction. willoughby He was my friend too, Jack... (A beat) ...but a man who isn't prepared to give his life for his friends, isn't a man at all... From the look on their faces, it's clear TRENCH and CASTELTON are beginning to agree with him. wILLOUGHBY This has to be answered. DURRANCE shakes his head, refusing to turn on Harry. He storms out of the room. INT. TRAIN to BINTREE - night. The whistle of a train. HARRY sits in a crowded carriage, looking stiff in his civilian clothes. He glances out of the window, but sees only his own reflection in the glass. EXT. ethne's carriage/ BINTREE - day. ETHNE drives the carriage through the country lanes, overjoyed to see HARRY. ETHNE ...How many days leave have they given you? harry How many days would you like? ETHNE They shouldn't have let you out of their sight. I'm going to kidnap you. harry I thought as much. This doesn't look like the way to your house. ETHNE laughs happily. HARRY can't quite bring himself to tell her yet. INT. village church near ethne's home - day. Dappled light shines in the small stone Church. ETHNE takes HARRY under the arm, and walks him up the aisle. harry Isn't this supposed to be bad luck? ETHNE Seeing me in the wedding dress is bad luck. This is practice. ETHNE looks towards the church benches, as if she's greeting the guests. harrY So I'm playing your father? ETHNE You have to be a little less steady on your feet. He's had a few to drink. harry (Taking slow deliberate steps) How is he? ETHNE Fine. He'll be thrilled to see you. ETHNE lets go of his hand as they reach the altar. She walks around him, and takes his other hand, as if he's the groom now. ETHNE "Do you Harry Feversham -- harrY (Skipping the rest) -- You may kiss the bride." He tries to kiss her. ETHNE (Laughing) You can't jump ahead like that. You have to let me enjoy my wedding. It's your fault the real one isn't for another year. HARRY hesitates, finally seeing his opportunity. harry There's nothing to stop us getting married whenever we like, Ethne. I've handed in my papers. A long silence. ETHNE stares at him, not sure she's understood. ETHNE ...When? harry Yesterday. I'd been thinking about it for a while. ETHNE Why didn't you tell me? Was it because of me? HARRY Because of you. Because of me. I couldn't see the point of continuing. The moment I fell in love with you my career in the army was over. ETHNE I would have supported your career. My mother did the same for my father. It's what's always been expected of me. harry I didn't think it was what you wanted. ETHNE still looks conflicted. ETHNE ...It is my fault Harry. I gave you the wrong impression. I'm really much more stoical than that. It wouldn't have been easy, but I'd have coped. I love you far too much to let a year make a difference. hARRY It wasn't what I wanted for us. (A hint of guilt as he hides the whole truth from her) I love this place. I love you in this place. We'll help your father with the farm. We'll get it going again. We'll begin our lives together. ETHNE is silent, moved by his words. harrY All I want is for you to be happy. ETHNE (The smile slowly returns to her face) I am happy Harry. She rests her head in his arms again. ETHNE As long as you're sure? hARRY Of course I'm sure. He holds her close, kissing her hair, hiding his eyes from her. EXT. courtyard/ ETHNE'S HOME/ BINTREE - DAY DERMOD's dogs leap on HARRY as he jumps off the carriage. HARRY Whoa! You ought to train these beasts Dermod. DERMOD I have. Trained them to scare away prospective son in laws. HARRY and DERMOD hug each other, already like father and son. INT. ENTRANCE/ ETHNE'S COUNTRY HOME - DAY A MAID hands ETHNE some letters and a parcel as she enters the house. HARRY follows her up the stairs. ETHNE Which room do you want? harry The one with the connecting doors. ETHNE You must have imagined that one. INT. the guest room/ ethne's house. day. Sunlight fills the room as HARRY throws open the blinds. He takes a long look at the fields outside. ETHNE (Glancing through her letters) I see you've moved in already. harry Why? ETHNE This one's addressed to you. She holds out the small parcel. HARRY walks over curiously. ETHNE (Teasing him) A secret admirer? harry (Teasing her back) I wonder which one it is. ETHNE I'll open it, thank you. She undoes the wrapping. There's a small white box underneath. She opens the lid. There's nothing inside, except three white feathers, pinned to three visiting cards. ETHNE's about to make a joke when she suddenly sees how pale HARRY looks. ETHNE What is it? (Looking at the feathers again) What does this mean? HARRY (Slowly) That there are some things that can't be hidden. ETHNE (Beginning to look worried) I don't understand. harry These are feathers of cowardice. ETHNE laughs, nervously. ETHNE What a horrible joke. harry It isn't a joke Ethne. They were sent in earnest. ETHNE By whom? Who sent them? (Her anger rising) How dare they!... harry (Reading the cards) Willoughby, Trench, and Castelton. ETHNE You see it is a joke. They're your friends. She looks to HARRY for confirmation. HARRY (All he can say) You're the most important thing to me. ETHNE (Panicked by his tone) Why are you saying that to me now? What is it Harry? harry We were told on Tuesday night that the regiment would be shipping out to the Sudan instead of India. That we'd be seeing war within a week. I handed in my resignation the following morning. There's a long silence as ETHNE takes it in. Like Durrance she won't accept it. ETHNE I don't believe that's why you resigned. You wouldn't have come to me like this. You wouldn't have been able to look me in the eye. HARRY stares at her guiltily, tormented. ETHNE (The tears shining in her eyes) ...I don't believe you. Three white feathers and our world is at an end. It can't be that simple... And still he doesn't answer. ETHNE ...Please Harry... You have to answer these charges... harry (Finally) I can't. All my life I've been following a path that's filled me with dread. I kept going because of the people behind me, and the people beside me, but all I wanted to do was turn and run. I didn't even have the courage to do that until I met you... ETHNE Don't use me as an excuse. harry Ethne -- ETHNE (Pulling away from him) -- This afternoon you told me you left the army because of me. Or at least you made me believe it. Tell me the truth? Would you have resigned if we weren't engaged? There's a long silence. These are the hardest words Harry's ever had to speak. harry Yes. I would have resigned. I wouldn't have gone to war for anything. ETHNE stares at him a moment, then removes her engagement ring from her finger, and holds it out to him. ETHNE I've no right to call you a coward, but you are a liar. Please take this back. HARRY takes the ring without protest. ETHNE turns and walks away. As she leaves she sets the feathers on the table, and closes the door behind her. HARRY listens to her footsteps fade. He walks towards the table. As he looks down he sees four feathers. Ethne has snapped the fourth from her fan. Very carefully, as if they were the most precious objects in the world, HARRY gathers them, his eyes shining with tears. EXT. LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. A burst of noise and colour. Rows of SOLDIERS march by, in perfect squares, proudly wearing their regimental colours. The wharf is lined with PEOPLE, cheering and waving flags, sending them off to inevitable victory. INT. stable deck/ troop ship/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. We can still hear the roar of the crowd outside. CASTELTON is trying to coax his horse into its box. TRENCH, and WILLOUGHBY, and DURRANCE wait for him. trench ...Come on Castelton. Give her a good kick. I want to wave to the ladies... EXT. wharf/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. The CROWD below cheers as the soldiers crowd the rails. EXT. rails/ troop ship/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. TRENCH waves at the crowd as if he were the Queen. CASTELTON is lost in the scale of it all. DURRANCE stares at the tiny figures, wondering if Harry's amongst them. willoughby (Interrupting his thoughts) ...Jack, I wanted to apologise for the other day. My argument wasn't with you. DURRANCE It's forgotten. DURRANCE keeps staring into the crowd below. EXT. wharf/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. HARRY stares up at the ship, a ghost amongst the cheering faces. The SOLDIERS at the rails look like specks, but Harry knows his friends are somewhere up there. EXT. officer's stand/ wharf/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. A line of RETIRED OFFICERS, salute as the vessel finally sets off. Amongst them is GENERAL FEVERSHAM, Harry's father. He stands at attention. EXT. LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. The celebrations over, the CROWD moves away from the docks. HARRY searches through the throng for his father. EXT. HANSOM CABS/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH wait in line for a hansom cab. The two old soldiers look frail in the falling rain. As they're about to climb onto a carriage, a voice calls out: HARRY (o.s.) Father...? The General turns around. His eyes fill with emotion as his son approaches. HARRY ...I need to talk to you, Sir. There's a long silence as GENERAL FEVERSHAM gazes at his son. HARRY looks as if he hasn't slept in days. His eyes are swollen and bloodshot, full of heartbreak and shame. For a moment it seems as if the old man will take him in his arms and comfort him, but instead he averts his eyes, and climbs into the carriage. COLONEL SUTCH looks at HARRY regrettably, as if to say there's nothing he can do. EXT. LONDON STREETS - night. NEWSBOYS follow HARRY home, trying to sell him their newspapers, refusing to take no for an answer. NEWSBOY ...It's a commemorative issue, Sir. War in the Sudan... HARRY buys a paper just to be rid of him, only for another NEWSBOY to take his place. SECOND nEWSBOY Different paper Sir, London Times. commerative issue... INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT - DAY. The sound of guns echoes in the distance. HARRY looks up. His face is unshaven, his eyes glassy from lack of sleep. Another volley sounds outside. HARRY gets off the floor and walks over. As he does so we see the piles of newspapers that have gathered on his floor over the past few weeks. The regimental guns boom outside. HARRY opens the window. He wants to hear them more clearly. He wants to be reminded of his shame. He walks back to the day's newspapers and kneels down amongst the mess. We see headlines of massacres and slaughters, beneath them artist's impressions of the Mahdist atrocities. EXT. LONDON STREETS - day. The NEWSBOYS run from HARRY now, mistaking him for a tramp. He catches up with one of them, forcing some money on him. NEWSBOY (Giving him a paper) British defeat in the Sudan! Hundreds dead!... HARRY flicks through the newspaper anxiously. EXT. war office/ LONDON - day. CROWDS have gathered outside the War Office. The mood has changed from celebration to panic. PEOPLE are stunned by the news of defeat, desperate to hear if their loved ones are alright. SOLDIERS hold back the surging mass. Only small groups are allowed in at a time. INT. corridor/ war office BUILDING/ LONDON - day. HARRY hurries down the corridor towards an area where the names of British casualties have been pinned to a notice board. PEOPLE swarm past him in the other direction. Some of them look relieved, others are overwhelmed by grief. HARRY hurries on, his heart pounding. INT. CASUALTY LIST/ war office BUILDING/ LONDON - day. HARRY pushes through the CROWD of peering heads. As he finally elbows his way to the front he glimpses the long list of casualties. His eyes look through the D's first. Durrance's name isn't there. No sign of Castelton under the C's. HARRY is jostled backwards as he searches for the other names. With a fierce effort he gets to the front again. No Trench under T, no Willoughby under W. They're all safe. HARRY's body slackens with relief. EXT. harry's appartment block/ LONDON STREET - day. HARRY looks drained as he reaches the front door of his building. As he opens it his LANDLADY walks out. landlady There's someone to see you Sir. They're waiting upstairs... HARRY doesn't wait for her to finish. INT. STAIRWAY/ harry's appartment block/ LONDON STREET - day. HARRY bounds up the stairs, expecting to see Ethne. He stops suddenly as he sees COLONEL SUTCH instead, waiting outside his door. He hides his disappointment with an awkward smile. hARRY Colonel Sutch... SUTCH can't help staring at HARRY, shocked by the state he's in. INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT - DAY. HARRY tries to make the room look more presentable, gathering up the newspapers and maps off the floor. He finally stops what he's doing and turns around. harry (Quietly) How is he? COLONEL SUTCH He's been very withdrawn. I've tried to persuade him to leave the house but he's a stubborn man. harrY Will he see me? COLONEL SUTCH I don't think so... (He pauses) ...but if it's money you need he won't cut you off. He hinted as much to me. harry I don't need money, Sir. HARRY turns away. SUTCH looks torn. As a soldier he disapproves of what Harry's done, but as a family friend he can't help feeling sorry for the boy. COLONEL SUTCH You were never cut out for this proffession. harrY (A thin smile) Was it that obvious? COLONEL SUTCH It was to me. Ever since you were a child. I only wish I'd said something to your father. HARRY turns and faces him. harrY (With an almost morbid curiosity) How did you know I didn't have it in me? COLONEL SUTCH What difference does it make? harrY It does to me, Sir. It's all I think about. What makes a man a coward? COLONEL SUTCH (Losing patience) That's enough Harry. Get on a grip on yourself. You're no use to anyone, sitting here all day, driving yourself mad... The outburst seems to release SUTCH from his soldier's reserve. He's all concern now. COLONEL SUTCH What's done, is done. harrY (Quietly) No Sir, it isn't. HARRY reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small white box. He opens it in front of SUTCH. There are four white feathers inside. SUTCH stares at the names on the cards. COLONEL SUTCH (Stunned) Who sent you the fourth? Jack? harrY Ethne. SUTCH looks up in surprise, beginning to realise the full extent of Harry's heartache. COLONEL SUTCH Throw them away. They don't mean a thing. HARRY They do to me, Sir. They're all I have left of my friends. COLONEL SUTCH Harry, this is morbid. harrY I don't mean it that way... (Trying to make him understand) You see, if there was something I could do, something so undeniable...I'm not saying it would change anything, it's too late for that...but if the feathers can be given, then they can be taken back. COLONEL SUTCH Harry, your friends are in Egypt. HARRY Yes Sir. In Alexandria. They transfer to Suakin in a fortnight. SUTCH doesn't understand at first. Then he looks at the newspapers and maps spread out across the floor, and begins to see the method in Harry's madness. COLONEL SUTCH (In disbelief) ...You're a civilian. Even if you find them, there's nothing you can do. harry I'm well aware of my chances. COLONEL SUTCH Then what's the point!? (Staring at him in dismay) You think Ethne will take you back? Is that what you think?! From the look in his eyes it's clear the thought had entered his head. Sutch's words bring him back down to earth. His voice is quieter now, resigned. harrY I don't have any choice... (With a terrible honesty) I'm not sure how much longer I can live with myself, here, like this... COLONEL SUTCH stares at him with pity, seeing the depth of his anguish. haRRY I'm leaving for Egypt tomorrow. COLONEL SUTCH (He realises there's no point trying to dissuade him) Do you want me to tell your father? harry Only if something should happen to me. I'll write and let you know how I am, as often as I can. COLONEL SUTCH What about Ethne? HARRY has to think long and hard about this. The thought of her fills him with sadness. hARRY I'd rather you didn't tell her anything. After all I've put her through the least I can do is let her forget me in peace. COLONEL SUTCH looks moved by his predicament, and impressed by these first, grasping signs of nobility. harrY Maybe I'll come back sooner than I think -- hear the guns booming off the African coast, and take the first ship home. COLONEL SUTCH I doubt it, Harry. COLONEL SUTCH smiles weakly. EXT. HARRY's POV. VIEW OF THE AFRICAN COAST - day. Through the shimmering heat we see the outlines of the African mountains: an arid moonscape, dust clouds blowing in the wind. EXT. port of ALEXANDRIA - DAY. The same veil of dust blows through the crowded port. HARRY covers his eyes. His hair is longer now, his face gaunt and bearded. Clutching his suitcase, he moves through the throng. EXT. streets of ALEXANDRIA - DAY. The alleyways look almost dreamlike through the shimmering heat. It's as if we're in Harry's head, reflecting his state of mind. A crowd of URCHIN BOYS are following his every step, imitating his langorous walk. HARRY doesn't notice them. His gaze is riveted by the sights around him: the MERCHANTS beckoning him into their shops; the BRITISH SOLDIERS on leave, sheltering in the cool hollows of the cafes and whorehouses; the BEGGARS, hunched up against the stone walls, their faces covered with flies. Through the arches of the Souk, a wedding procession appears. The BRIDE and GROOM sit on brightly painted donkeys. All around them WOMEN and CHILDREN clap and shrill. HARRY catches a glimpse of the bride's face. She gazes at him for a moment, then looks away. INT. COLONIAL HOTEL/ ALEXANDRIA - DAY. The colours of the Souk give way to the cool white emptiness of a colonial hotel. ENGLISH GUESTS talk in hushed whispers as EGYPTIAN WAITERS serve them tea. HARRY sits in a corner of the lobby, nursing his drink, observing a group of ENGLISH OFFICERS, laughing amongst themselves. HARRY looks thoughtful, wondering how to approach them. Suddenly he hears a commotion. A drunk BRITISH CORPORAL is escorted out of the hotel by a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. He shouts and swears, but they ignore him, throwing him out of the door. HARRY gets up as he sees his chance. INT. EGYPTIAN bar - brothel/ BAZAAR/ ALEXANDRIA - night. The rhythmic beating of drums. Tattooed WOMEN dance on a makeshift stage, mesmerising the crowd of eager SOLDIERS. HARRY sits with the drunken BRITISH CORPORAL. The man's eyes keep drifting longingly towards the stage, as if he hasn't seen a woman in months. HARRY fills his glass. BRITISH CORPORAL (Resuming their conversation) ...It's all reconnaisance trips. The river's too swollen to move troops in numbers. Her Majesty's army's rotting in Suakin. harry Which other regiments were with you? BRITISH CORPORAL They're all there: the Hussars, the Highlanders, the Grenadiers...Which newspaper did you say you were from? hARRY The London Times. BRITISH CORPORAL You must think I'm a disgrace? 'Sand happy'. That's what those Officers called me. harry How much longer do you think the troops will be held up in Suakin? BRITISH CORPORAL As long as they can if they're lucky. (He finishes his drink) Does the Prime Minister read your paper? harrY I imagine so. BRITISH CORPORAL Then tell him from me we're on a losing wicket here. These bastards aren't scared of anything. If they saw death walking down the street they'd hide in an alleyway and try to pick him off with a stone. How do you fight people like that... He tries to drain the last few drops from his empty glass, then looks over longingly, at the tattooed DANCERS. EXT. SAND STORM/ desert near SUAKIN/ sudan - DAY. Thick gusts of sand blow at us. As the swirling clouds settle we see a group of misshapen figures, huddled together. As they finally rise and start to move, we realise they're BRITISH SOLDIERS, on camels. Amongst the dust caked faces we see TRENCH, CASTELTON, WILLOUGHBY and DURRANCE. EXT. DESERT near SUAKIN/ SUDAN - DAY. The sand storm has cleared, and in its place a harsh desert sun beats down. The COLUMN OF BRITISH SCOUTS trudges forward. DURRANCE rides at the front, looking as if he were born here, eyes alert to every shimmer and nuance. Up ahead he sees a large mound of stones standing out amongst the mud flat. He drives his camel forward. As he approaches he sees that it's a dervish burial mound. Skulls and skeletons are splayed across the rocks. WILLOUGHBY rides up through the ranks and joins him. WILLOUGHBY What do you think? DURRANCE I think they're trying to frighten us off. We should keep pressing forward. WILLOUGHBY offers DURRANCE his water flask. DURRANCE takes a drink. DURRANCE (Pulling a face) It's bloody whisky. wILLOUGHBY (Grinning) My camel drinks the water. EXT. burnt out fortress/ desert - day. As the camels tread their way through the sun baked shingles a ghostly fortress appears on the horizon. The men start loading their rifles instinctively. EXT. courtyard/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. All that's left of the fortress is a grim skeleton. The Union Jack lies ripped to shreds, halfway down its flagpole. The BRITISH SOLDIERS gaze at the destruction. Their camels sense their tension and rear a little in the eerie silence. As ever, TRENCH is the first to break the ice. trench (Jumping off his camel, walking towards the fortress well) I don't know about you lot, but I'm going to grab a drink before Mustapha does. "Mustapha" the camel whinnies as if he's understood every word. The MEN start laughing. DURRANCE The water's probably poisoned. trench (Leading his camel towards the well instead) Mustapha, be my guest. There's more laughter. DURRANCE smiles but his eyes are still alert. Above the fortress tower he sees a flock of birds taking flight, rising up gracefully towards the desert sun. Suddenly amidst the laughter and chatter, one of the SOLDIERS topples off his camel. His FRIENDS laugh: friendS ...Capshaw you dosy bastard... ...Camilla's tired him out... CAPSHAW doesn't move. CASTELTON's the first to realise something's wrong. He jumps off his camel and turns CAPSHAW over. Half the soldier's face has been blown off. Raw bone glistens underneath. CASTELTON rears back in horror. CASTELTON Sniper! Panic erupts. The SOLDIERS leap off their camels, using them as shields. The sniper's bullet rings out and sends one of the animals crashing to the dirt. The men start to run now, seeking shelter in the surrounding hutments. The sniper's gun rings out repeatedly. EXT. HUTMENT/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. DURRANCE and CASTELTON duck into the hutment. DURRANCE ...Keep him pinned. He's up in the tower. CASTELTON unleashes a volley of shots. DURRANCE moves quickly to the other side of the hutment and climbs out of the window. EXT. courtyard/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. The camels circle around themselves in panic. TRENCH weaves his way between the rearing animals, protecting himself from the sniper. A shot rings out and spits dust in his face. trench (Whispering in anger) You bastard... EXT. outer perimeter/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. DURRANCE runs around the back of the fortress, breathing hard. EXT. courtyard/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. A second shot spins TRENCH round, grazing him in the arm. trench (His voice rising) You bastard! A third shot narrowly misses. TRENCH is up and running now, not waiting for the fourth. trench (Shouting like a madman as he charges towards the hutment) You bastard! You bastard! You bastard! EXT. outer perimeter/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. DURRANCE has a clear view on the sniper's tower now. From below he can see the man's rifle edge out, fire, and then withdraw. DURRANCE heads quietly towards the tower stairs. EXT. STAIRS/ SNIPER's TOWER/ burnt out fortress - day. Several of the steps are missing from the rickety stairway. DURRANCE climbs over them as lightly as he can. Up above he can hear the sniper's rifle ringing out. EXT. castelton's HUTMENT/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. CASTELTON fires another round at the sniper's tower. TRENCH sits on the floor, cursing as he bandages his grazed arm. EXT. SNIPER's TOWER/ burnt out fortress - day. DURRANCE raises his head cautiously. At the tower window he sees the DERVISH SNIPER firing his rifle. DURRANCE hesitates. He could kill the man easily, but it would mean shooting him in the back. He can't bring himself to do it: DURRANCE Drop it! The DERVISH SNIPER stops still. He turns around slowly and looks DURRANCE in the eye. A contemptuous smile flickers across his face. Very slowly, he takes a bullet from his pocket and slips it in the rifle. He doesn't even look at DURRANCE. There's a terrifying, suicidal calm about him. DURRANCE studies his enemy, admiring his utter contempt for death, and then fires two bullets into his head. EXT. TENTS/ THE BRITISH CAMP/ suakin/ sudan - night. Bonfires flicker across the British camp. DURRANCE sits outside his tent, bathed in firelight, watching some BEDU DANCERS performing for the BRITISH TROOPS. He seems far away, as if he's thinking about the day's kill. TRENCH's braying voice snaps him out of his reverie. treNCH (Showing off his wound) Look at this beauty... TRENCH sits down between DURRANCE, CASTELTON, and WILLOUGHBY. trench (Playful) It's true what they say. You haven't lived until you've been shot. CASTELTON It's only a scratch. trench You wouldn't understand. You haven't looked into the abyss. CASTELTON Shut up Trench... DURRANCE joins in the laughter but he still seems far away. wiLLOUGHBY (Noticing) Are you alright, Jack? DURRANCE (Smiling) Couldn't be better. WILLOUGHBY sees the haunted look in his eyes, but doesn't say anything. A SEARGENT-MAJOR interrupts. seRGEANT-MAJOR Lieutenant Durrance, Colonel Hamilton would like to see you in his tent, sir. trench Poor Willoughby, they've passed you over. WILLOUGHBY grabs a handful of sand and throws it at TRENCH. DURRANCE gets up to see what HAMILTON wants. EXT. COLONEL HAMILTON's TENT/ BRITISH CAMP/ suakin - night. COLONEL HAMILTON sits at a fold-up table, eating his dinner by candlelight. He turns around as DURRANCE walks in. He wipes his face with his knapkin and gestures for DURRANCE to sit. COLONEL HAMILTON ...Congratulations, it seems you had another successful day. DURRANCE (Too honest to accept the complement) We killed one Dervish sniper, Sir. COLONEL HAMILTON I'm giving you three weeks leave. DURRANCE looks surprised. DURRANCE I really don't need, or deserve any leave. COLONEL HAMILTON You certainly deserve it, every report I receive singles you out for praise. DURRANCE With your permission, I'd like to stay here with the rest of the regiment. COLONEL HAMILTON Permission refused. DURRANCE is too disciplined a soldier to protest. COLONEL HAMILTON ...Anyway the rest of the regiment is stuck here in Suakin until the Government agrees to send us to Khartoum... (Containing his frustration) You and several other Officers will be going to London, to convince parliament, and more importantly public opinion, that it is necessary to pursue this campaign with the utmost vigour. Do you have any questions? DURRANCE Yes Sir, why me? HAMILTON pauses. Then almost mischievously: COLONEL HAMILTON Because you're a hero. DURRANCE With all due respect Sir, I don't think we've been fighting long enough to have any heroes in this campaign. COLONEL HAMILTON That's my point. It's all about perception. DURRANCE sees there's no point discussing it further. He salutes and turns to leave. COLONEL HAMILTON A question Lieutenant? DURRANCE Yes Sir? COLONEL HAMILTON What is it you like about this place? DURRANCE chooses his words carefully. DURRANCE The freedom Sir. The fact that one is reduced to what one really is. COLONEL HAMILTON smiles softly, wondering if Durrance is insulting him, not giving a damn. EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. A searing white sun hangs over the desert. Somewhere amidst the rolling dunes and floating dust we see a caravan of camels, winding its way through the plateau. EXT. caravan/ desert between egypt and sudan - day. HARRY rides at the front of the caravan with GUSTAVE, a sun blackened french slave-driver. Behind them ride SAADI, his Dinka assistant, and three beautiful DINKA SLAVEGIRLS. gustave ...The British soldiers rent my girls off me for three dhirrams an hour. Well worth the trip to Suakin. HARRY smiles distractedly. His eyes are fixed on the majestic landscape before him, miles and miles of rolling desert. gustave (Recognising the first time awe one feels for the desert) Don't fall in love too quickly. Nothing turns on you like the sand. He looks back at the DINKA SLAVEGIRLS, who are whispering amongst themselves. gustave Shut up!!... (To Saadi) Keep them quiet! What do I pay you for?! SAADI says something to the SLAVEGIRLS in their native Dinka tongue. From the deference in his voice it's clear the women are from a higher caste than him. EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. A breeze blows sand-drifts across the desert floor. As a veil of dust clears, HARRY sees the bones of a camel, forming a perfect skeleton on the floor. gustAVE Bones are a good sign. We must be near a well. EXT. well/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. The skeletons lie thick around the well: six or seven men in Bedu Robes, sprawled within yards of the precious water. gustave (As Harry stares at the bones) What else is there to fight for in a desert. At least it makes sense of war. SAADI hoists some water up in a goatskin canteen. He offers the canteen to GUSTAVE. The French slave-driver is about to take a drink when he hears one of the DINKA SLAVEGIRLS murmuring in her native tongue. He wheels his camel around angrily. gUSTAVE (To Saadi) What did she say? Before SAADI can make an excuse for her, the DINKA SLAVEGIRL starts cursing in her native tongue, her eyes fixed on GUSTAVE. GUSTAVE lashes out with his whip. The SLAVEGIRL's camel rears, throwing her to the floor. GUSTAVE rides towards her, raising his whip, ready to beat her. HARRY's camel suddenly lurches between them. At first it looks like he's lost control of the animal, but as he steadies his mount, it becomes clear he's put himself in Gustave's way. GUSTAVE sneers. With inch perfect skill, he starts to circle HARRY, trying to get a clear view of the girl. With equal skill, HARRY twists his own camel round, keeping her blocked from him at every turn. GUSTAVE grows impatient. He raises his whip, threatening Harry. HARRY doesn't flinch. His eyes are fixed on Gustave the whole time. Finally GUSTAVE backs down, intimidated by the mysterious stranger. He stares at HARRY, half in anger, half in admiration. gustave You ride well. With that he rides his camel back to the well. The DINKA SLAVEGIRL doesn't look at HARRY. She's too proud to acknowledge his help. INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. A howling sandstorm blows outside the cave. The camels screech in the night, terrified by the wind. SAADI and the DINKA GIRLS shelter in the furthest corner of the cave. HARRY and GUSTAVE sit by a flickering fire. gUSTAVE ...What's your secret? Anyone who talks as little as you do must be hiding something? Did you kill a man? HARRY prods the fire, ignoring him. GUSTAVE turns around as he hears SAADI and one of the DINKA GIRLS whispering. guSTAVE Taiser vouz! Silence. GUSTAVE turns back to HARRY, looking pleased with himself. guSTAVE You have to break them. For their own good. They'll only be happy again when they forget what it's like to be free. (He looks at Harry mischievously) It's like a man who's been thrown over by a woman. At first he's defiant, then he's determined, but finally he longs to forget. HARRY gets up and walks to the other side of the cave. He hears GUSTAVE chuckling behind him. gUSTAVE ...Any secrets you have, the desert will find you out. EXT. PASS/ CLIFFS/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. A screaming gale howls through the desert pass. INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. It isn't the storm that wakes HARRY up, but the sound of whispering. GUSTAVE is snoring by the fire. HARRY looks past him. He sees SAADI and the DINKA SLAVEGIRL he rescued earlier, lying in each other's arms, making love as quietly as they can. HARRY can't help staring. Their act seems to represent the ultimate defiance, he ultimate affirmation of their freedom. He feels a spark of hope in their hope. SAADI and the DINKA SLAVEGIRL finally come to rest in each other's arms. HARRY listens as they continue to whisper in their native tongue. He's about to close his eyes when suddenly the DINKA SLAVEGIRL gets up. HARRY watches curiously as she walks across the cave. She picks something off the floor. As she walks towards GUSTAVE HARRY suddenly sees that it's a sharp jagged rock. Before HARRY can say anything the girl falls to her knees and buries the rock deep into GUSTAVE's face. Almost simultaneously HARRY feels a sharp crack on the back of his head. He rolls away instinctively, but to no avail. The blows rain down. As he tries to protect his face, HARRY sees SAADI, holding a thick wooden club over him. The club hammers down, splitting Harry's fingers, tearing into his face, knocking any resistance out of him. As he stares up listlessly, HARRY sees SAADI standing over him, ready to finish him off. Suddenly a voice rings out, a woman's voice, calling Saadi off. HARRY's eyes drift away. INT. ARMY/NAVY CLUB - LONDON - day. We see ETHNE's face now, staring out. For a moment we think she's part of Harry's dream, but then the familiar noises of reality fade in, and we realise she's amongst a crowd of OFFICERS and JOURNALISTS, listening to DURRANCE lecturing about the Sudan: DURRANCE (Aware she's in the audience) ...Each moment we delay, we imperil General Gordon's life. The Mahdi is concentrating all his forces on Khartoum. At most the garrison can hold out for a few more weeks... EXT. ARMY/NAVY CLUB - LONDON - day. DURRANCE stands at the club entrance with ETHNE and her friend, CAROLINE ADAIR. ETHNE ...Caroline read about your lecture in the Times. We're both very proud of you. DURRANCE I'm glad you came. DURRANCE tries not to stare at ETHNE too hard. CAROLINE ...We have to be somewhere this afternoon, but if you're free this evening Lieutenant Durrance... DURRANCE I'm afraid I have to give another talk. ETHNE (Suddenly) Would you mind if I didn't come with you Caroline? I don't know the Gilby's all that well... CAROLINE hesitates. We see the reluctance in her eyes, but she's far too dignified to show it. CAROLINE You can do whatever you like, darling. EXT. LONDON/ STREET - day. DURRANCE and ETHNE walk along a crowded street. Passing WOMEN glance admiringly at DURRANCE in his uniform. ETHNE That's six I've counted. DURRANCE Six what? ETHNE Six married women, gawping at you. DURRANCE smiles shyly, wondering if she's flirting with him. INT. tea shop/ LONDON - day. A tinkle of china and cutlery. ETHNE and DURRANCE sit in a tea shop. ETHNE can't help sending up the place. She dabs her lips with her napkin, pretending to be all prim and proper. DURRANCE Do you want to go somewhere else? ETHNE No, it's lovely here. I'm teasing. DURRANCE looks out of place in the surroundings, and nervous around ETHNE. ETHNE (Trying to put him at ease) I want to hear all about the desert? She leans towards him, like a child waiting to hear a tale. DURRANCE isn't sure if she's aware of the effect on him. DURRANCE It grows on you. There's something about all that emptiness that concentrates the mind. ETHNE (Looking into his eyes) On what? DURRANCE (He hesitates) You spend a lot of time thinking about the people you miss -- especially at night -- You have the most vivid dreams, it's hard to believe they're not real... He stops as he sees the sadness in her eyes, reminded of the barrier between them. DURRANCE Have you heard from Harry? ETHNE (A beat) No. Have you? DURRANCE I went to see General Feversham. He refused to discuss it with me. ETHNE I know they had a falling out. She tries to sound casual, but DURRANCE feels how much the thought of Harry still pains her. DURRANCE (Testing her, almost in spite of himself) He's one of the people I think about all the time. ETHNE (Very deliberately) I don't as much as I used to. (Looking up at Durrance) I certainly wasn't until you brought him up. There's a touch of reproach in her eyes, but also something flirtatious. It's as if she's forcing herself to put Durrance above Harry in her thoughts. ETHNE When do you go back? DURRANCE Friday. ETHNE So soon? DURRANCE isn't sure how to read her disappointment. He feels conflicted about Harry, but he can't help being drawn to her. DURRANCE (Awkwardly) Are you sure I can't persuade you to stay in London a few more days? Listen to more of my boring lectures... ETHNE I thought the talk was fascinating. DURRANCE (Steeling himself) I really would like to see you again before I leave. There's something touching about Durrance's shyness: a contradiction between the fearless warrior and the tentative lover. ETHNE feels torn, but she wills herself on: ETHNE (Lightly, but acknowledging his invitation nevertheless) You could always visit us in Bintree. She feels her eyes drifting away from him, but she forces herself to look back, and holds his gaze. INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. HARRY opens his eyes painfully. His face is still battered and swollen from Saadi's beating. As he picks himself up he sees Gustave's body, lying exactly where the Dinka slavegirl killed him, the jagged rock still embedded in his face. HARRY looks away as he hears a camel whinnying outside. EXT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. The camel is tied by some rope to a jutting rock, a goatskin canteen slung over its back. HARRY realises the Dinka girl he rescued has left them for him. He looks over the horizon. There's no sign of the Dinkas, only the vast desert waste. EXT. DUNES/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. HARRY urges his camel up the steep slope of a crescent dune. His battered face is burnt raw by the sun, his skin covered in blisters. He looks out hopefully as his camel finally conquers the sandy peak, but all he sees in its place are miles and miles of rolling dunes. EXT. water trough/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. Harry's camel noses its way into a shallow water trough. HARRY almost drops off the animal in his haste to drink. He digs his hands into the mud and cups some of the precious liquid in his palms. It's only after he's drunk that he realises there are dozens of tics, stuck to his arms, and face. EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. HARRY shivers in the cold night air, partly from the wind, but also from the fever he's caught off the tics. Hands trembling, he burns the blood gorged insects off his arm with a glowing stick from the camp-fire. EXT. shingles/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. HARRY's camel rears as it treads over the searing shingles. He topples off. Eyes half shut, he grabs the reins, making sure the camel doesn't run off. He takes a knife from his pocket. harry ...I'm sorry, I'm sorry... He cuts a slash in the camel's hide and puts his mouth to it. He sucks up what little blood he can, and rolls the liquid around his mouth. EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. HARRY talks to himself in the dark. His face is all puffed up with fever, his hair chalked with dust. Above him the stars glimmer, promising another day of relentless sun. EXT. DESERT HILLS/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. HARRY lies unconscious on the camel's back, roped to the animal. The CAMEL noses it's way through the desert floor, coming across a few shrubs. It tears them out of the earth, and starts up the hill, in search of more nourishment. HARRY slides precariously down the camel's back. Only the ropes hold him tight. As the camel finally reaches the top we see a vast plateau open up before us. The earth is still desert brown, but there are patches of green now -- and somewhere in the distance, the sky is blackening with rain. EXT. STREETS OF SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night. A torrential downpour floods the narrow streets of Suakin. A group of excited BEGGAR BOYS lead HARRY and his camel through the rain swept alleyways. EXT. LOCAL HOTEL/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night. HARRY lies shivering on a bunk bed, overwhelmed by fever. An ARAB DOCTOR treats his ravaged skin with balm. Behind them the BEGGAR BOYS argue with the ARAB HOTELIER, demanding more money for bringing the foreigner here. ARAB DOCTOR English? HARRY shakes his head no. EXT. marketplace/ STREETS OF SUAKIN/ SUDAN - day. Sunlight dries out the previous night's storm. HARRY wanders through the marketplace, wearing long Bedu robes now, limping from his desert ordeal. PASSERSBY pull away as they see his face, mistaking the open blisters for leprosy. EXT. RIVERBANK NEAR THE BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - day. A crocodile rears out of the water and tears a lump of meat off a hook. It disappears back under the surface, avoiding the trap. There's a cry of disappointment from the riverbank. A group of LOCAL CHILDREN are trying to catch the beast. TRENCH is their leader. CASTELTON smiles at his friend's antics. treNCH ...Don't give up lads. Give the old porker another whack. The BOYS have tied a pig to a stake, outside the water. They beat it with a paddle until it whines. Hearing the noise, the CROCODILE rears its head, and sweeps towards the remaining lump of meat on the hook. TRENCH and the BOYS swarm around the river expectantly. In their excitement they fail to notice the shrouded FIGURE watching them from the distance. It's HARRY, hidden beneath his Bedu robes. He gazes at his two friends longingly. Finally one of the BOYS sees him, and thinking he's a leper, starts throwing stones: sudanese boy Imshi, imshi. The other BOYS join in, yelling insults. TRENCH and CASTELTON pay no attention. They have no idea who it is. HARRY steps back slowly, the pebbles landing at his feet, still gazing at his friends. He knows he doesn't have the courage to face them yet, that it's too soon. INT. HAMILTON's TENT/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night. Colonel Hamilton's tent is lit in torchlight. Dozens of OFFICERS mill about, celebrating their orders to march on Khartoum. A MAJOR FROM ANOTHER REGIMENT ...It's hard to imagine anyone changing the Prime Minister's mind. COLONEL HAMILTON Even he reads the papers. They told him if he didn't send us to Khartoum he'd be indicted for murder... There's laughter all around. Across the tent, DURRANCE stands on his own, feeling out of place. WILLOUGHBY arrives with two drinks. wILLOUGHBY You're quite the hero tonight. DURRANCE The Colonel seems to be taking a fair bit of credit. They smile as they watch COLONEL HAMILTON holding forth. wILLOUGHBY So you had a good time in London? DURRANCE Better than I thought. wILLOUGHBY (Trying to make it sound casual) Did you look up Harry? DURRANCE (Hesitating) Nobody knows where he is. wILLOUGHBY Not even Ethne? DURRANCE (A little put out) Why should she? She's broken off their engagement. WILLOUGHBY notices the edge in his voice but doesn't say anything. DURRANCE feels a touch of guilt, surprised by his own jealous reaction. INT. HARRY's ROOM/ LOCAL HOTEL/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night. HARRY studies his face in the mirror: his blisters have dried into tough leathery skin, his eyes are hollow from recent hardships. He whispers to himself in broken Arabic, and dips his fingers into a dark, mud like substance. He applies it to his hair, his beard, and his teeth. EXT. COOLIES/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day. Long lines of DESERT AFRICANS have gathered outside the British camp, looking for work as coolies. There are Nuers, Dinkas, Somalis, Ethiopians, all of them wearing different clothes, and speaking different languages. Somewhere amongst them, we see HARRY, disguised in his Bedu robes. He's being examined by a BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR and an EGYPTIAN ORDERLY. BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR Tell him to remove his shirt. HARRY waits for the ORDERLY to translate before he opens his robes. His body is lean and tanned and scarred. BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR (Impressed by his physique) This one's been in the wars. Let me see his teeth. Again HARRY waits for the Arabic translation before he opens his mouth. BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR Good bones. Put him on the boats. HARRY is ushered off. As he walks away he hears an argument start up behind him. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY is protesting to the SEARGENT MAJOR about hiring a fierce looking NUBIAN warrior. EGYPTIAN ORDERLY ...This man comes from a race of slaves. They have blood feuds with everyone. If you arm him it will mean trouble. None of the Egyptian soldiers will serve with him. The NUBIAN stares ahead in silence, expressionless. BRITISH OFFICER Alright, put him on the boats. The NUBIAN falls into line, behind HARRY. EXT. DRILL AREA/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day. WILLOUGHBY barks orders at the EGYPTIAN RESERVES, drilling them before departure. DURRANCE, TRENCH, AND CASTELTON walk out of their tent, imitating him. EXT. COOLIES/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day. HARRY watches his friends from afar. He sits amongst the COOLIES, holding out his soup bowl, waiting to be fed. The NUBIAN squats opposite him. HARRY can't help staring at the long white ostrich feather in his hair. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY arrives and pours a rancid looking gruel in HARRY's bowl. He turns to the NUBIAN. EGYPTIAN ORDERLY (In Arabic) Is this good enough for you slave? The NUBIAN ignores him. The ORDERLY spits in the gruel before handing it to him. The NUBIAN takes it, and calmly downs it in one. The ORDERLY moves on in disgust. The NUBIAN looks at HARRY. HARRY braces himself and swallows the stew. EXT. CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day. A heavy current rushes through the waters of the Nile. The cataracts are full of treachorous rocks, jutting out in all shapes and sizes. HARRY is force-marched with the other COOLIES, prodded on by the EGYPTIAN OVERSEERS. They drag the British supply boats through the cataract by hand, pulling on huge hemp ropes. In front of HARRY, the NUBIAN is being singled out for punishment. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY lashes him repeatedly. The NUBIAN keeps pulling, ignoring the stinging pain. He looks back at the ORDERLY as if to say; "Is that all you've got?" EXT. SUPPLY BOAT/ CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day. A supply boat rushes down a steep incline in the river. TRENCH yells at the top of his voice as the spray hits his face. CASTELTON stands beside him, staring at the banks of the Nile, watching the hundreds of COOLIES, dragging their boat through the cataracts. EXT. COOLIE CAMP/ CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - night. Drum beats fill the night sky. The reflection of the coolies' camp-fires glistens over the black water. Some are singing, others praying, but most lie fast asleep. HARRY sits on his own, warming himself by a fire, his body wracked with pain. As he reflects he hears the gentle tread of feet. He looks up to see the NUBIAN staring at him. The man squats down beside his campfire without asking. nubian (Abou fatma) (In English) My name is Abou Fatma. haRRY (Shaking his head as if he doesn't understand) Bedu. ABOU FATMA I was a scout for General Hicks. harry Arabi -- ABU FATMA suddenly launches into a flurry of fluent Arabic. HARRY stares at him in silence, unable to respond. ABOU FATMA There are many in this camp who would serve the Mahdi. When they find out there is a British spy amongst them, watching them, they will kill him. (Quietly mocking) It won't be long, Bedu. He turns to leave. HARRY hesitates, then: harry Shoukran. ABOU FATMA (Correcting his Arabic) Shoukhran. Their eyes stay on each other a moment. harry (Finally speaking in English) Why do you warn me? ABOU FATMA For money. harry I can't pay you. ABOU FATMA I can't help you. HARRY smiles. He gazes at the mercenaries's powerful features, and the long white feather in his hair. harrY What's the feather for? ABOU FATMA The first time I killed a man. (Pointing to a feather earring in his left ear) Five men. (and an ivory bracelet on his wrist) Ten men. (He takes a beaded necklace out of his pocket) This I will wear soon. I'm a good soldier. I will protect you. HARRY stares at him a moment, then takes out a small box from his pocket. He shows ABOU FATMA the four white feathers inside. ABOU FATMA looks at them, unaware of the irony in Harry's gesture, thinking he's saying he doesn't need help. ABOU FATMA (Gesturing to the welts on Harry's body) Underneath the flesh is white, and weak. Even if the Mahdi's men don't find you out, the whips will. harry I'll pay you one shilling a day. ABOU FATMA No. ABOU FATMA gets up, and walks away. HARRY can't help smiling as he stares after him. EXT. COOLIE CAMP/ CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day. Screams of agony fill the air. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY lies in a pool of blood, his belly sliced open, holding his guts in his hands. HARRY stands amongst the gathered crowd, watching horrified, as a BRITISH OFFICER kneels beside the dying man. BRITISH OFFICER Who did this to you? Who did this? The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY tries to speak, but all that comes out of his mouth is a froth of blood. His tongue has been cut out. HARRY looks around the crowd until he sees ABOU FATMA. The Nubian's eyes are expressionless. Around his neck he wears the beaded necklace now. EXT. CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day. The white sails of the British supply boats float through the hazy water. On the riverbank HARRY and the hundreds of other COOLIES drag them along. The OVERSEERS glance at ABOU FATMA warily, but none of them dare raise a whip to him now. INT. DURRANCE's tent/ BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. We can still hear the noise of the coolies outside. DURRANCE sits at a table, writing a letter. We glimpse the words: 'Dearest Ethne...' He stops as he hears a commotion outside. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. DURRANCE walks out of the tent. In the distance he sees a handful of ragged looking BRITISH OFFICERS being helped off their camels. As he stares more closely DURRANCE notices that many of them have terrible wounds. Those that can still walk are lead off to the commander's tent. EXT. general wolsey's tent/ BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. GENERAL WOLSEY and COLONEL HAMILTON are bent over a map of the Nile, discussing their progress with their AIDE-DE-CAMPS. WILLOUGHBY looks up as he hears the WOUNDED OFFICERS being led into the tent. He stops as he sees the terrible state they're in. Even WOLSEY and HAMILTON look shocked. GENERAL WOLSELEY (Slowly rising, saluting) What is it? WOUNDED CAPTAIN A letter, sir... from General Gordon. WILLOUGHBY notices one of the WOUNDED OFFICERS has tears in his eyes. GENERAL WOLSELEY What happened to you? WOUNDED CAPTAIN We were ambushed, Sir. More than half our company were killed. GENERAL WOLSELEY See that these men are tended to. AIDE-DE-CAMP Yes, sir. The WOUNDED OFFICERS are led out. WILLOUGHBY, like all the other Aide-de-Camps, looks dazed. GENERAL WOLSEY opens General Gordon's letter, and reads in silence. GENERAL WOLSELEY (Finally looking up at Colonel Hamilton) Gordon says he can only hold out for forty more days. It took eleven for these men to get here. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - night. DURRANCE, WILLOUGHBY, CASTELTON, and TRENCH sit around a camp fire, trying to ignore the hideous cries of the wounded British soldiers coming from the hospital tent. wILLOUGHBY (Recounting what he's heard) ...Wolsey's going to split the force. A River Column's going to continue down the Nile, whilst a Desert Column joins up with regiment at Abou Clea, and makes a dash for Khartoum. The piercing screams start up again. trench Don't tell me, we've drawn the short straw. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. Silence hangs over the British camp. The COOLIES are lined up under the scorching sun. The EGYPTIAN OVERSEERS walk past them, selecting some for the desert march, others for the river march. HARRY stands next to ABOU FATMA. Across the camp he can see DURRANCE, TRENCH, CASTELTON, and WILLOUGHBY, preparing their camels for the overland trek. haRRY (Whispering to Abou Fatma) I need to travel with the desert detachment. ABOU FATMA Two Shillings. HARRY nods. The EGYPTIAN OVERSEER finally reaches them. EGYPTIAN OVERSEER (To Abou Fatma, in Arabic) We'll keep you on the river. ABOU FATMA (A calm, menacing look in his eyes) With you? The EGYPTIAN OVERSEER hesitates, remembering what happened to his friend: EGYPTIAN OVERSEER (Gesturing to the desert column instead) Over there. HARRY falls into line behind ABOU FATMA. The EGYPTIAN OVERSEER doesn't seem to care. He's too relieved to be rid of the Nubian. EXT. DESERT COLUMN/ BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. The Desert Column has assembled, fourteen hundred strong. SERGEANt at arms Column... FOR-WARD... march! DURRANCE, TRENCH, CASTELTON, and WILLOUGHBY, ride off at the head of the column. Behind them, the COOLIES carry heavy loads, HARRY and ABOU FATMA bringing up the rear. EXT. DESERT lanscape/ sudan - day. A region of jutting cliffs and giant rock formations. The Desert column rides through a narrow pass. DURRANCE's eyes are fixed on the ridges above them, any one of which could be hiding a Dervish sniper or scout. At the back of the column, HARRY's equally alert. He looks across the cliff walls. Suddenly he notices one of the COOLIES in front of him, listening intently to a high pitched whine coming from a nearby gorge. HARRY studies the man. He's a powerfully built NUER TRIBESMAN, yellow streaks running down his long black hair. Every time he hears the distinctive noise, he looks up, concentrating. HARRY edges closer to ABOU FATMA: harry (Indicating the whining) Do you recognise that sound? ABOU FATMA Mountain goats. HARRY doesn't look convinced. He stares at the NUER TRIBESMAN, walking ahead of them, glancing up from his heavy load every time he hears the distinctive cry. EXT. OPEN DESERT/ sudan - day. The wind blows gusts of sand into the camels' eyes. DURRANCE stares through the shimmering heatwaves. DURRANCE There's a sandstorm coming. COLONEL HAMILTON looks at the clear blue sky, seeing nothing to indicate a storm, but trusting Durrance's instincts. EXT. DESERT CAMP - night. HARRY and the other COOLIES gather sticks and desert shrubs, building a makeshift wall around the camp. The wind has picked up, blowing thick gusts of sand in their faces. As they work in the darkness and the dust, HARRY hears the whining sound he heard earlier. It's quieter now, but closer. ABOU FATMA hears it too. harry It's coming from inside the camp. They look around, but the dust obscures everything. The whining starts up again. HARRY concentrates until he thinks he knows where it's coming from. He checks to make sure the ORDERLIES aren't watching them, and then signals for ABOU FATMA to follow him. EXT. EDGE OF THE DESERT CAMP - night. Through the drifting clouds of sand we see a FIGURE crouching near the camp perimeter. It's the NUER TRIBESMAN Harry noticed earlier. Every time the wind picks up he calls out to the surrounding cliffs in a high piched whine. HARRY and ABOU FATMA watch him from behind a wagon. ABOU FATMA draws a knife from his boot. haRRY We need to find out who he's signalling. ABOU FATMA replaces the knife reluctantly, and points to a makeshift corrall where the camels are gathered. INT. TENT/ DESERT CAMP - night. The tent flaps blow in the storm. TRENCH, CASTELTON, and WILLOUGHBY shelter inside, sharing a bottle of whisky. DURRANCE sits apart from the others, reading a letter. treNCH Is that the same letter you read over and over again, or do you get a different one each day? DURRANCE (He can't help a smile) It's the same one, but it's twenty pages long. wILLOUGHBY He writes them to himself. Go on Jack, read us a line. DURRANCE Read your own. trench Don't be so coy, you're amongst friends. Grins all around. DURRANCE looks at letter and tempts them with a single line: DURRANCE "...I often think about our walks by the river..." He stops enigmatically to a chorus of protest: tRENCH More, more... DURRANCE hesitates, reluctant to break the confidence of a letter, but anxious to broach the subject with his friends. DURRANCE (Reading more quietly) "...Your letter surprised and delighted me...If I appear indecisive it's because I'm thinking of both of us...In the meantime I hope the length of my reply gives you some assurance of how very much I care about you..." DURRANCE lowers the letter and looks at his friends. treNCH So who's the lucky lady? DURRANCE (After a moment) Ethne...I've asked her to marry me...You probably gathered that from the letter. There's a long silence. Astonishment. Then suddenly TRENCH raises his glass and roars. treNCH Congratulations. wILLOUGHBY That's fantastic Jack. DURRANCE She hasn't said yes. trench Of course she will: "I hope the length of this reply gives you some idea of how much I bloody love you." DURRANCE "How much I care about you." treNCH Same thing. TRENCH fills his glass to the brim. DURRANCE laughs, relieved that his friends have taken it so well. It's only as he drinks that he catches a hint of disapproval in CASTELTON's eyes. CASTELTON raises his glass, trying to hide his feelings, but DURRANCE sees through him. The moment is interrupted by loud shouting outside: BRITISH CORPORAL o/s ...Something's up with the camels. CASTELTON I'll go. CASTELTON looks relieved to leave the tent, worried that his conflicting emotions will betray him. DURRANCE stares after him, not entirely free of the memory of Harry himself. EXT. DESERT CAMP - night. CASTELTON follows the CORPORAL through the windswept camp. Up ahead they can hear the camels screeching. CASTELTON covers his eyes from the dust. Suddenly he sees the silhouettes of two RIDERS, charging out of the corral. One of them stops and stares at him momentarily. CASTELTON (He can't see the man's face clearly, but his outline seems hauntingly familiar) Harry? The RIDER turns and charges out of the camp. The CORPORAL blows a whistle, reaching for his gun, firing after them. CASTELTON stares at the disappearing figures, wondering if what he saw was real, or a figment of his troubled conscience. EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE DESERT CAMP - night. HARRY and ABOU FATMA ride up a steep hill, shots ringing out behind them. EXT. RIDGE ABOVE THE DESERT CAMP - night. As the sands sweep past we see the Mahdi's scouts for the first time: four NUER TRIBESMEN, standing on a ridge, looking down on the British campfires below. As they hear the shots, they turn away from the cliffside, and mount their camels. EXT. VIEW FROM A CLIFF/ DESERT - day. The sand storm is still blowing, obscuring the sun. In the distance, the tiny figures of the NUER SCOUTS, can be seen riding across the arid sandscape. HARRY and ABOU FATMA watch them from the cliffs, and set off in pursuit. EXT. ridge/ VIEW on NUER's campfire/ DESERT - night. The Nuer's camp-fire glows far below on the valley floor. HARRY and ABOU FATMA have built their own fire in a crevice on the cliff wall, hidden from view. HARRY's eyes are fixed on the Nuer scouts, ABOU FATMA's are fixed on him. ABOU FATMA Why would a British spy be hiding from his own people? HARRY looks up at the Nubian, realising he can't keep up the pretence any longer. hARRY Because I'm not a spy. ABOU FATMA You're a deserter? harry (A long pause) Something like that. I was sent to fight, and I ran away. ABOU FATMA considers this for a moment. ABOU FATMA All soldiers run away. Only the good ones return. HARRY smiles. harry Shoukran. ABOU FATMA Shoukhran. HARRY looks away. Down below the Nuer's camp fire goes out. EXT. OPEN DESERT - night. The moonlight colors the dunes in blues and greens. HARRY and ABOU FATMA follow the Nuers' tracks through the virgin sands. EXT. crest of A hill/ OPEN DESERT - day. The sunrise casts a blood red light over the horizon. The four NUER SCOUTS appear on the crest of a hill. We see them clearly now, their long black hair streaked yellow, their faces painted ghostly white. They survey the land beneath them and gallop off. EXT. THE same HILL/ desert - day. ABOU FATMA and HARRY walk their camels quietly up the hill, following the Nuers' hoofprints. As they reach the top of the dune a vast plateau opens up beneath them. They see the NUER SCOUTS, riding along a winding trade route. At the end of the desert road stands a huge fortress. ABOU FATMA That is Abou Clea. A British fort. HARRY stares after the Nuer scouts, wondering why they're heading back into a British stronghold. The four riders merge into one of the caravans that dot the landscape. EXT. CARAVAN/ TRADE ROUTE TO ABOU CLEA - day. A long line of DINKA REFUGEES walk alongside one of caravans, begging for food. HARRY and ABOU FATMA ride near the back, their faces hidden by their Djellabas. EXT. FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. A village of tents has spread around the fortress walls. More STARVING REFUGEES clamour at the gates. HARRY gazes up at the garrison walls. BRITISH SENTRIES can be glimpsed high up. The fortress gates creak open to let the caravan through. HARRY lowers his eyes as he rides past the guards. EXT. courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. As he looks up again, HARRY suddenly feels a rush of panic. The fortress courtyard is filled with DERVISH WARRIORS. There are no British faces anywhere. HARRY glimpses a familiar red uniform, but as he stares more closely, his relief turns to horror. The British uniform is stained with blood. Wearing it is a fierce looking DERVISH WARRIOR with long braided hair. HARRY looks back at the ramparts. All the soldiers he thought were British sentries are in fact Dervish warriors, wearing the bloody uniforms of their victims. As he turns around, HARRY sees the worst sight of all. Hanging from scaffolds, are the chalk white bodies of the real British soldiers. HARRY is shaken out of his horror by a sharp hissing sound. ABOU FATMA glares at him to keep calm. DERVISH WARRIORS grab hold of their camels, and lead them with the rest of the caravan towards the stables. INT. stables/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY and ABOU FATMA tether their camels. Behind them the DERVISH WARRIORS unload the caravan's shipment of rifles. ABOU FATMA (Whispering to Harry) Follow me out. HARRY nods, still in shock. ABOU FATMA turns around and heads out of the stables, unchallenged. EXT. courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY follows ABOU FATMA through the crowded courtyard. His eyes are drawn to the torchlit faces all around him. The Mahdi's army is made up of dozens of different tribes: some in glowing war paint, others marked with ritual scars, wearing the dried viscera of their victims around their necks. The Dervishes' eyes seem to follow HARRY wherever he goes, staring out at him through their slit Djellabas. Suddenly HARRY feels a pair of hands grab him. He wheels around to see a huge DERVISH CAPTAIN towering over him. DERVISH CAPTAIN (In Arabic, studying Harry's features) Come with me. ABOU FATMA (In Arabic) Our caravan is waiting outside. DERVISH CAPTAIN (Waving Abou Fatma away) Imshi! ABOU FATMA murmurs something to HARRY in his native Nubian tongue, slipping in the English words: 'I'll find you.' DERVISH CAPTAIN (To Harry, in Arabic) Follow me! EXT. gallows/ courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY's heart is pounding as he walks back through the hellish courtyard. He isn't sure if the DERVISH CAPTAIN has realised he's British. It's only as he points HARRY towards the gallows that he realises the predicament he's in. DERVISH CAPTAIN (In Arabic; gesturing to a mound of British dead) Over there. HARRY hesitates, then walks over to the pile of British corpses, convinced he's going to be shot amongst them. DERVISH CAPTAIN (In Arabic; gesturing to the uniforms) Find one that fits. HARRY stares at him, then slowly begins to understand. He's been picked out as a pale looking Arab, one that might pass as a British officer from a distance. As he looks around he sees other DESERT ARABS, grinning at him, wearing their own blood stained British uniforms. HARRY kneels beside the slaughtered British soldiers. One of them still has his pipe stuffed between his teeth. As HARRY stares at the obscenity, his fear slowly turns to anger. With trembling fingers he unbuttons the dead man's jacket. As he slips the bloodstained British uniform over his shoulders we begin to see the change in his eyes. EXT. ABOU FATMA/ courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. ABOU FATMA wanders amongst the Dervish army, begging for alms, searching for Harry. Finally he spots him at the far end of the courtyard, sitting amongst the other DERVISH WARRIORS IN BRITISH UNIFORMS. EXT. HARRY/ courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. ABOU FATMA grovels at the feet of the DERVISHES, before he approaches HARRY. ABOU FATMA (In Arabic) Alms for the poor. HARRY turns around. His eyes are distant. He looks back at the spot he was staring at before. At first ABOU FATMA thinks he's in shock, but then he sees what HARRY's looking at. Across the courtyard stands a large tent, surrounded by flags. Waiting outside, are the four NUER SCOUTS. ABOU FATMA (Beginning to see his intent) We have to leave. harry Wait for me at the gates. (As Abou Fatma starts to protest) Imshi. The other DERVISHES look at ABOU FATMA threateningly. ABOU FATMA gets up and walks away reluctantly. Across the courtyard, the NUER SPIES have been ushered into the tent. INT. WAR COUNCIL tent/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. The MAHDI, a tall, gaunt, warrior in desert robes, listens to the NUER SCOUTS in silence. As they notify him of the British advance, he starts to draw a battle plan on the tent's sandy floor. His LIEUTENANTS move closer to see what he's planning. INT. WAR COUNCIL tent/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. Outside the tent more DERVISH WARRIORS have gathered to catch a glimpse of their revered leader. HARRY is amongst them. He stares at the white clad figures within. Suddenly he feels a pair of eyes on him. He turns to see the DERVISH CAPTAIN who stopped him earlier, watching him intently. HARRY moves off. The DERVISH CAPTAIN stares after him suspiciously. EXT. gates/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. ABOU FATMA waits anxiously outside the fortress gates. The hordes of STARVING BEGGARS are pushed back as a troop of DERVISH WARRIORS ride out, carrying the naked bodies of the British dead. ABOU FATMA stares after them, wondering what's going on. EXT. HARRY/ courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY looks behind him. Through the milling crowd he sees the DERVISH CAPTAIN, still following him. His heart pounding, HARRY heads towards the stables, trying to give him the slip. EXT. HARRY/ STABLES/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. Camels kick and snort in the stable. HARRY crouches down. Through the animals' legs he sees the DERVISH CAPTAIN enter. Suddenly the DERVISH CAPTAIN shouts at the top of his voice. The camels scatter, leaving HARRY exposed. The DERVISH CAPTAIN stares at him menacingly. HARRY bows, and starts to walk towards him, in supplication. His hand slips behind his back, groping for the knife that's hidden there. The DERVISH CAPTAIN barks at him to stay where he is. As he steps backwards, HARRY suddenly charges, and drives the dagger deep into his gut. The DERVISH CAPTAIN screams, but all that comes out is a terrible hissing sound. HARRY clamps his hand over the CAPTAIN's mouth and bends his head backwards. As they tumble to the ground, HARRY twists the knife in deeper. The Dervish bites down in agony, drawing a stream of blood from Harry's knuckles. HARRY rams his fist deeper into the man's throat, choking him slowly. Meanwhile his knife hand tears its way out of the Dervish's gut, and plunges back into his thigh. The CAPTAIN's eyes water in pain and fear. HARRY stares at him, crushing his spirit with his own unflinching gaze. As he feels the man's grip weaken, he pulls away sharply, and swings the knife down with all his force. The blade sticks in the DERVISH CAPTAIN's chest, sending his eyes spinning out of focus, forcing a rush of blood out of his mouth. HARRY watches in horror, as the man's eyes roll around, desperately trying to find their focus, then stop still. He feels his enemy's dying breath on his face, and hears a horrible sucking sound, as he withdraws the knife. HARRY's arm is elbow deep in gore. He turns away and tries to retch, but nothing comes out. He stays like that for a moment, bent over the bloody sand, contemplating what he's just done. Finally he gathers himself, grabs the dead man by the ankles, and drags him further into the stable. EXT. courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY brushes past the crowds of DERVISH WARRIORS, his eyes fixed on the fortress gates ahead. He's only a few yards away, when a DERVISH SENTRY calls out: DERVISH SENTRY (In Arabic) The gates are closed. HARRY stares at him dangerously. For an instant it looks like another fight may ensue, but then a calming voice calls out: ABOU FATMA (In Arabic) Let him give us alms. It will bring you both fortune in battle. ABOU FATMA sticks his hands through the fortress gates, along with the hundreds of other BEGGARS outside. HARRY begins to understand. He pulls out some coins from his robes, and approaches the BEGGARS. harry (Whispering to Abou Fatma, as he hands out alms) Go to the British camp. Tell them they're going to be ambushed. Tell them they have to change their route. It's a trap... ABOU FATMA stares into HARRY's eyes, seeing the change that's come over them. EXT. BRITISH COLUMN/ DESERT VALLEY - day. DURRANCE rides at the front of the column. He suddenly stops, and stares ahead in horror. All across the desert floor he sees the marble white bodies of dead British soldiers. Wild dogs chew at their remains. The whole of the column seems frozen for a moment. Then TRENCH suddenly breaks rank, and charges the animals, screaming at the top of his voice, dispersing them with his whip. EXT. tents/ THE SLOPE OF A HILL/ DESERT VALLEY - day. The column has set up camp until their dead comrades are buried. The OFFICERS dig the graves themselves, watched by the COOLIES now. A CORPORAL approaches WILLOUGHBY and salutes. CORPORAL A native to see you, sir. He says he has some intelligence regarding the route we're on. ABOU FATMA is pushed forward by the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. wILLOUGHBY (Eyeing him suspiciously) What intelligence? ABOU FATMA You must leave this area. The EGYPTIAN silences him with a slap to the head. EGYPTIAN CORPORAL This man is lying. He's a deserter. He stole the camels -- ABOU FATMA -- I went to Abu Klea. The Mahdi's forces have captured your garrison. They will attack you in this place. TRENCH and DURRANCE have arrived to see what's happening. TRENCH stares at ABOU FATMA menacingly, still seething over the treatment of the British dead. wILLOUGHBY (To Trench and Durrance) This is their idea of misinformation. (Toying with Abou Fatma) Who told you this? ABOU FATMA A British Officer. wILLOUGHBY (Mockingly) A General no doubt. What else did he tell you? ABOU FATMA (With equal disdain) That you wouldn't believe me. WILLOUGHBY smiles at the Nubian's gall, but TRENCH explodes at his insolence. trench (Grabbing Abou Fatma by the neck) I'll show you a British Officer... (Forcing him on his knees in front of one of the butchered corpses) This is a British Officer!... (Rubbing Abou Fatma's face into a patch of bloodstained sand) This is a British officer's blood. Lick it up! Every bloody drop!... The NUBIAN spins around, ready to strike. TRENCH draws his knife, daring him to make a move. ABOU FATMA (Controlling his anger) The Muslims bury their dead. Even the enemy dead. These bodies have been left here for a reason. To keep you here. To hold you up. wILLOUGHBY (Ignoring him) Take him away. Find out why he was sent here. Do whatever you have to do. The SOLDIERS disperse. Only DURRANCE stays where he is, thinking about the Nubian's warning. EXT. courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - day. A chant of 'Allah Akbar' rises over the fortress walls. Hundreds of WARRIORS kneel and pray in unison. HARRY does the same. EXT. tent/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. ABOU FATMA is on his knees, manacled to a tent pole. EGYPTIAN CORPORAL (In Arabic) ...You work for the Mahdi! ABOU FATMA (In English) I fought the Mahdi... The EGYPTIAN lashes him with a bull-whip. EGYPTIAN CORPORAL (In Arabic) ...Who sent you?! ABOU FATMA A British Officer. The EGYPTIAN starts whipping Abou Fatma again, ready to kill him. DURRANCE finally intervenes. DURRANCE That's enough... He kneels down beside ABOU FATMA, staring into his eyes. ABOU FATMA sees no mercy in his gaze, but at least there's a glimmer of curiosity. DURRANCE Why would you want to help us? ABOU FATMA The Mahdi is allied with slave traders... (pause) My family were taken prisoners and sold as slaves. DURRANCE considers Abou Fatma's answer. There's something about it that has a ring of truth. DURRANCE glances at the BRITISH SOLDIERS, digging graves in the open desert, and then stares up at the surrounding hills. EXT. gates/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. Through the clouds of dust we see the first of the Mahdi's army riding out -- ghostly DINKA WARRIORS, naked from head to foot, caked in white ash. Behind then come the NUERS, long streaked hair trailing in the wind, faces painted the colors of a nightmare. The HADENDOA spearmen follow, blood-stained feathers in their hair, banging on their calf skin drums. Last of all come the DERVISH RIDERS IN THEIR BLOODSTAINED BRITISH UNIFORMS. HARRY rides at the heart of the demonic troop, his eyes filled with dread. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. DURRANCE surveys the surrounding hills. CASTELTON watches him curiously. CASTELTON What is it Jack? DURRANCE's eyes stare at the horizon, still not sure. EXT. HILLS beyond ABOU CLEA - day. At a signal from the MAHDI, his army splits in two, some following the green flags, others the black. HARRY and the DERVISH RIDERS IN BRITISH UNIFORMS are told to wait. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. WILLOUGHBY and TRENCH join CASTELTON and DURRANCE at the edge of the camp. DURRANCE is still staring at the ridges above them. As they listen, they can just make out a distant rumble of thunder. DURRANCE looks up. The sky is perfectly blue. DURRANCE We'd better get the Gatling gun out. EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. NUER SCOUTS, daubed in yellow camouflage, appear out of the rocks. INT. CASTELTON's TENT/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. CASTELTON walks into his tent and searches through his belongings. He finds one of his bibles, kisses it for luck, and slips it in his jacket pocket. As he turns around he sees TRENCH grinning at him. trench You haven't got a spare one have you vicar? EXT. SLOPE OF A HILL/ DESERT - day. Through thick gusts of sand we see hundreds of bare feet and horses' hooves moving up the desert slope. The sand at their feet pours back down the slope like an avalanche. EXT. DURRANCE's POV/ CREST OF the HILL/ DESERT - day. As DURRANCE gazes up, the first of the Mahdi's army appear on the crest of the hill, a handful of SCOUTS, riding back and forth, judging the British numbers. As the SCOUTS disappear, a curtain of dust rises up behind them. As it settles, DURRANCE sees thousands of figures appear along the length of the hill, their green banners fluttering in the wind. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. Across the camp, CASTELTON and TRENCH stare mesmerised, as another huge army appears on the opposite hill. This time their banners are black. Panicked voices ring out. officers' voices Form a square...Form a square... EXT. CREST OF the HILL/ view of the british camp - day. The Mahdi's armies stare down from the wind whipped slopes, thousands of expressionless faces, listening to the British bugles shrilling down below. From above we see the British fighting square taking shape: red and khaki colors separating into units, the bright blue of the Egyptian uniforms forming a larger wall around the perimeter. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. The GRENADIER GUARDS are crouched in formation, rifles ready. TRENCH changes position, asking one of the other SOLDIERS to swap with him, settling down next to CASTELTON. trench You can't get rid of me that easily. CASTELTON's fear seems to vanish in an instant. EXT. GREEN FLAGGED ARMY/ CREST OF the HILL - day. A cry of Allah Akbar is picked up by thousands all along the ridge, turning into a deafening roar as the Green flagged Army finally charges. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. DURRANCE moves along the lines of RIFLEMEN, barking intructions over the wind. DURRANCE Fire at the horses. Fire at will. A volley of shots answers his call. EXT. GREEN FLAGGED ARMY/ slope OF the HILL - day. Enemy horses and riders collapse, sliding down the slopes. EXT. DESERT VALLEY - day. The British camp is shrouded in gunsmoke, flashes of orange light bursting through, the Gatling gun wreaking havoc. EXT. GREEN FLAGGED ARMY/ FOOT OF THE HILL - day. Through the sand drifts, we see the camels' hooves rearing up, bursts of arterial blood as the bullets tear into their hide. The HADENDOA SPEARMEN leap over the walls of torn flesh, and charge the British lines in a suicidal frenzy. EXT. CASTELTON/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. CASTELTON aims at the PAINTED WARRIORS. Every time he fires, someone falls. Every time he kills, he murmurs a prayer. TRENCH bites his lip so hard, his mouth fills with blood. He spits it out as he drops yet another man. EXT. BLACK FLAGGED ARMY/ FOOT OF THE HILL - day. The DERVISH HORDES keep coming, clambering over the bodies of their dead. EXT. HARRY/ ENTRANCE TO THE VALLEY - day. Far away, at the entrance to the valley, HARRY can hear the screams of the wounded and dying. Even the DERVISH WARRIORS seem apprehensive. Only the MAHDI is calm, waiting for his moment. He raises his hand, and signals for the horsemen in British uniforms to charge. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. Enemy bullets crackle past DURRANCE's head, but he doesn't seem to notice. Through the smoke and dust he sees hundreds of enemy dead, lying in blood smeared heaps. The Dervish onslaught is less sustained now. The occasional STRAGGLER appears out of the haze and is blown away by a burst of gunfire. Suddenly DURRANCE hears the sound of a bugle. EXT. CASTELTON/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. CASTELTON and TRENCH hear the bugle too. They stop firing as they see the remnants of the black flagged army retreating into the hills. There's a moments confusion and then a roar of celebration around the camp as the SOLDIERS see a troop of BRITISH CAVALRY, riding out of the sand clouds towards them. EXT. HARRY/ DESERT VALLEY - day. HARRY stares in horror as he sees the BRITISH SOLDIERS, breaking rank, waving at the charging RIDERS, thinking they're British cavalry. HARRY kicks his horse and tries to weave his way out of the charging horde. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. The BRITISH SOLDIERS gather at the camp perimeter to welcome the approaching cavalry. EXT. HARRY/ DESERT VALLEY - day. HARRY charges through the red uniformed Dervish ranks, ignoring orders to stay in line. At a signal from one of the DERVISH LIEUTENANTS, the horsemen raise their bows. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP - day. DURRANCE stares curiously as a flicker of sunlight streaks across the heads of the distant riders. He watches the approaching dust cloud, wondering why it's coming at them so fast. Slowly he begins to make out the first figures. Something about them isn't right. Their uniforms hang too loosely. They ride too far apart. He reaches for his gun. EXT. HARRY/ DESERT VALLEY - day. HARRY breaks through the Dervish line. Behind him he hears the mounted ARCHERS stringing their bows. He drives his horse forwards, towards a lone BRITISH SOLDIER, standing on the camp perimeter. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP - day. DURRANCE sees the lone rider, charging towards him, yelling at the top of his voice. He can't see the man's face or hear his voice, but he's convinced these riders are the enemy now. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP - day. HARRY sees DURRANCE aiming his rifle, a moment too late. The gunshot sends his horse spinning to the ground. He feels the weight of the animal pin him down. As he looks up he sees the DERVISH RIDERS riding over him, letting their arrows fly. EXT. BRITISH CAMP - day. The sky above flickers with light as the arrows catch the sun. The steel shafts hurtle down, plunging into exposed eyes and throats. All around him CASTELTON sees SOLDIERS totter and fall, arrows sticking out of them like quills. He pulls out his revolver and starts firing at the onrushing horses. EXT. DERVISH RIDERS/ PERIMETER OF BRITISH CAMP - day. The DERVISH lances skewer the BRITISH SOLDIERS as they try to run back to their lines. Some of the DERVISH RIDERS dismount and finish them off with their daggers, and their bare hands. EXT. GREEN FLAGGED ARMY/ slope OF the HILL - day. On the desert slopes, the retreating green flagged army wheels around and charges back into the fray. EXT. WILLOUGHBY/ BRITISH CAMP - day. WILLOUGHBY looks up, and sees the Mahdi's black flagged army, also swarming back towards the British ranks. EXT. HARRY/ PERIMETER OF BRITISH CAMP - day. HARRY is still pinned. He slits the dead horse's belly with his knife, and slides his leg under the gore. He gets to his feet and runs towards the fighting, desperate to reach his friends. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP - day. DUURANCE yells at the top of his voice: DURRANCE Close the square! Close the square! CASTELTON and TRENCH fire at the charging horses. As they fall, the other GRENADIERS take courage, and rush at their RIDERS, bringing them down in a volley of gunfire. The SOLDIERS clamber over the dead bodies and link up with the rest of their Square. EXT. HARRY/ PERIMETER OF BRITISH CAMP - day. HARRY can't see the British square reshaping, but he can see its rippling effect all along the DERVISH line. He cuts his way through like a beserker. Whatever doubts and fears his civilized self felt his primitive self now rejects. He fights like a man possessed. EXT. grenadiers/ british square - day. The BRITISH line pulls back, firing and reloading as it retreats. EXT. WILLOUGHBY/ PERIMETER OF BRITISH CAMP - day. WILLOUGHBY stares in horror at the bloodshed all around him. Through the hellish smoke he sees ABOU FATMA, still tied to the whipping post, staring at him in silent reproach. EXT. grenadiers/ british square - day. CASTELTON fires into the enemy ranks. He's out of ammunition. TRENCH is retreating with the other GRENADIERS. He sees his friend stalling and yells: trench Get back! Get behind us! CASTELTON doesn't hear him. His parade ground training is taking over. He lowers the rifle and fixes a bayonet on it. EXT. HARRY/ AMONGST THE CHARGING DERVISHES - day. Through the swarming ranks, HARRY glimpses CASTELTON, standing alone with his bayonet poised. He calls out as well. EXT. CASTELTON - day. CASTELTON hears nothing but the pounding of his own heart. The DERVISH WARRIORS swarm towards him. He disembowels the first WARRIOR, then swings his bayonet around to meet the next. The DERVISH impales himself, right up to his rib cage. CASTELTON tries to pull his blade free, but the bayonet is locked in bone now. EXT. TRENCH/ RETREATING grenadiers/ british square - day. TRENCH stares in horror as he realises what's happened. The noises around him seem to fade as he gazes at CASTELTON, straining as he did in the training ground, trying to pull the bayonet free. EXT. HARRY/ AMONGST THE CHARGING DERVISHES - day. HARRY runs as fast as he can, trampling over the dead soldiers and horses that litter the desert floor. EXT. CASTELTON/ ISOLATED FROM THE SQUARE - day. CASTELTON tries to loosen the blade, but it's no use. He looks up to see a storm of painted faces, rushing towards him, spears pointed at his eyes and guts. Somewhere amongst the screaming horde, he glimpses a familiar face, calling out. A smile flickers across his face. He mouths the words 'Harry' as the first of the Dervish spears sinks into his heart. EXT. TRENCH/ RETREATING grenadiers/ british square - day. TRENCH screams in agony as he sees CASTELTON disappear. He charges out of the retreating British line, swinging at everything in his way, breaking skulls and shattering bone. He's only yards away from CASTELTON when a blow to the back of the head sends him sprawling. EXT. DURRANCE/ RETREATING grenadiers/ british square - day. DURRANCE charges out of the British square as he sees his friends fall, firing round after round into the enemy ranks. Every time his gun empties, he picks up another from a dead soldier, and keeps going. EXT. HARRY/ AMONGST THE DERVISHES - day. HARRY drops to his knees, next to CASTELTON's body, protecting his friend's corpse from further abuse. EXT. TRENCH/ AMONGST THE DERVISHES - day. TRENCH stares up at the nightmare faces crowding all around him. The butt of a spear cracks open his head, reducing everything to a terrifying silence. He feels a sea of hands, reaching down, tearing his uniform, lifting him in the air. EXT. DURRANCE/ WALKING TOWARDS THE DERVISHES - day. DURRANCE charges towards the enemy, firing into their massed ranks, oblivious to any danger. One of his guns jams. DURRANCE keeps pressing the trigger. The gun suddenly backfires and blows up in his face. EXT. HARRY/ AMONGST THE DERVISHES - day. HARRY sees DURRANCE fall. He gets up and runs through the enemy ranks, pretending to be one of them. He leaps on DURRANCE as he tries to get up, pinning him to the ground, stopping him getting himself killed. The unsuspecting DERVISH WARRIORS sweep past them, towards their next victims. HARRY keeps DURRANCE pinned, until the enemy hordes disappear. Only then does he stand up. He looks down at his friend. DURRANCE doesn't seem to recognise him. At first HARRY thinks it's the sunlight blinding him, but then he sees the powder burns around DURRANCE's eyes. DURRANCE gropes around. He starts crawling away on his hand and knees. He crawls right into a mud bath of Dervish dead. He rears back in horror, and lets out a little cry of panic. HARRY slowly begins to understand. He watches in anguish, as his friend claws at his eyes, trying to rub the blindness out of them, his whimpers of panic turning into howls of agony. INT. BRITISH HOSPITAL SHIP/ ALEXANDRIA - day. The screams of the wounded BRITISH SOLDIERS echo all around the hospital ship. CAPTAIN CALDER, the Regimental surgeon, stands over Durrance's bed. DURRANCE stares out, blindly. CAPTAIN CALDER ...You ought to see a specialist once we're back. DURRANCE Is it part of your treatment to offer false hope? CAPTAIN CALDER Only for some. (reaching in his pocket) This came for you. He hands over a letter. DURRANCE sticks it in his top pocket. DURRANCE I'll read it later. (Grinning as he realises Calder hasn't caught the joke) If you wouldn't mind, Doctor... He hands the letter back to CALDER to read for him. CAPTAIN CALDER (Glancing over it) ..."Dear James, I hold in my heart all you have written me"... (He looks up) I feel a little awkward reading this... DURRANCE Don't. There's something strident in Durrance's voice, a brittleness that hides the insecurity inside. CALDER continues: CALDER ..."Knowing you as I do, and convinced as I am of your affections, I wish to go back on my previous fears. I'm writing now, to let you know how grateful I am to have you in my life -- and to say, with all my heart, how much I wish to be in yours...With all my love, Ethne." CALDER, lowers the letter, quietly moved. CAPTAIN CALDER Congratulations... DURRANCE stares out quietly. DURRANCE I knew a man once who went blind, a good man too, before...A year after you wouldn't have recognised him. He was the most selfish, exacting, egotistical human being you could ever meet. I wouldn't wish him on anyone... He smiles ironically, hiding the heartbreak inside. DURRANCE The one thing I want most in this life, finally comes to me when I can no longer accept it. INT. DRAWING ROOM/ CAROLINE's house/ OUTSIDE LONDON - day. ETHNE stares out of the drawing room window, waiting. Her friend CAROLINE sits at a table, pretending to be absorbed in her book, listening just as intently. There's the jingle of a carriage outside. CAROLINE That's him. ETHNE It isn't stopping. EXT. DURRANCE's carriage/ STREET/ caroline's house - day. DURRANCE stares ahead as the carriage passes Caroline's house. DURRANCE (To the Driver) Drive around once...Describe the entrance to me... INT. DRAWING ROOM/ caroline's house - day. ETHNE turns away from the window. CAROLINE Maybe you should have gone to the station to meet him. ETHNE He might have thought I was going because I imagined he was helpless. I don't want him to feel like that. There's a quiet resolve in Ethne's voice, as if she's been mulling over her future life with Durrance. The doorbell rings. ETHNE That must be him. CAROLINE gets up to answer the door. ETHNE walks to the window. Her movements are nervous, her eyes tense. The door finally opens. DURRANCE walks in, alone. As soon as ETHNE leaves the window he turns around and looks straight at her. ETHNE (Startled) It isn't true then, you can see... DURRANCE (Gently) It's perfectly true. I can't see a thing. ETHNE stops, feeling guilty. DURRANCE You moved from the window, that's how I knew. ETHNE I hardly made a noise. DURRANCE No, but the window was open. The noise outside grew louder. She tries to answer his smile. ETHNE Let me get you some tea, and then we can talk. DURRANCE (Sensing her tension) Yes, we have a lot to talk about. ETHNE's hand trembles as she pours the tea. DURRANCE interprets every sound. She picks up the cup and walks over with a smile, holding it out for him. DURRANCE I hate to sound humble, but I don't trust myself with a cup of tea yet. ETHNE feels stupid again. She sets the cup down on a table. DURRANCE (Gently) You're not bound, you know. There's a pause. ETHNE knows exactly what he means. ETHNE Bound by what? DURRANCE I wouldn't dream of holding you to your letter. Or a committment you made to a different man. ETHNE stares at him in surprise, and then in quiet admiration. ETHNE You're not a different man. DURRANCE I don't say it begrudgingly. I'm not being particularly noble or heroic either. It's something I've thought about long and hard -- ETHNE Jack -- DURRANCE -- Please hear me out... (With difficulty) I'm thinking of myself as much as you. I have to learn to accept what's happened. I have to learn to respect the person I've become. The only way to do that is to start again. ETHNE Why does it have to be without me? Her words make him hesitate. DURRANCE Because if I was with you, I'd spend every moment wondering how you really felt about me. ETHNE If you don't know how I feel about you, then that's a good reason to call off our wedding. Your blindness isn't. She stares at him, determined. DURRANCE looks touched by her devotion, but still doesn't feel worthy of her love. DURRANCE It has to be more than mere obligation Ethne, or even friendship. It has to be more than that... ETHNE suddenly reaches out and touches his face. DURRANCE stops as he feels her fingers. He's lost for a moment, unsure of himself. ETHNE leans forward and kisses him, tenderly at first, but then more and more passionately, proving herself to him, proving herself to herself. DURRANCE kisses her back, close to tears. EXT. PATIO/ caroline's house - DAY. A sharp clatter of hooves. DURRANCE rides his horse with the help of a GROOM, his face fixed in concentration. ETHNE and CAROLINE watch him from the patio. ETHNE (Gazing at him proudly) He seems to need his eyes less and less each day. It's incredible. Nothing escapes him. Sometimes I think he reads me like a book. CAROLINE You no longer have your face to screen your thoughts. ETHNE doesn't notice the edge in her voice. She's lost in her own thoughts. DURRANCE climbs off his horse and strides towards them, looking pleased with himself. DURRANCE (Wrapping Ethne in his arms) You smell wonderful. ETHNE And you smell like a horse. Go wash. ETHNE keeps smiling, even after DURRANCE has gone. CAROLINE watches her friend quietly, fighting the jealousy she feels within. A voice interrupts their separate thoughts: GARDENER o/s (Calling out) ...Someone to see you Miss Eustace. ETHNE looks up to see a UNIFORMED OFFICER, standing with the GARDENER, by the maze. She gets up curiously. EXT. garden/ maze/ caroline's house - day. As ETHNE approaches the soldier she suddenly stops, recognising him. It's WILLOUGHBY. wILLOUGHBY I went all the way to Bintree to find you. Your father told me you were here. I'm sorry I came unannounced, I needed to talk to you alone... ETHNE doesn't reply or return his smile. WILLOUGHBY seems to read her thoughts. wILLOUGHBY I understand how you feel, Ethne. All I can say is that we never set out to hurt you. What happened was between us and Harry, not the two of you. ETHNE (Coldly) What do you want, Tom? WILLOUGHBY hesitates, bracing himself. wILLOUGHBY ...I've seen Harry. In Suakin. He asked me to give you these... He holds out TWO SOILED WHITE FEATHERS. ETHNE stares at them, unable to speak, her whole world turned upside down. wILLOUGHBY He risked his life to save our regiment. He fought as if he'd been born to it. I've come to tell you I've withdrawn my accusation of cowardice against him, along with Castelton's. ETHNE (All she cares about) Is Harry dead? wILLOUGHBY He was fine when I saw him. He'd changed a great deal but he was in good health. ETHNE Changed how? wILLOUGHBY I didn't spend much time with him. I don't know what else to tell you Ethne. ETHNE Tell me everything Tom. Please... (Imploringly) If by your own admission you've hurt me, then I have a right to know. EXT. PATIO/ caroline'S house - DAY. CAROLINE watches curiously from the patio, as ETHNE and the mysterious Officer, walk into the maze, deep in conversation. EXT. maze/ caroline's house - day. ETHNE and WILLOUGHBY sit on a bench in the garden maze. wILLOUGHBY ...Nothing prepared us for what happened. We were two miles short of Abou Klea when we were ambushed. We managed to hold off the enemy, but at a terrible cost. A few days later Khartoum fell and the whole expedition was called off... TIME DISSOLVE BACK TO: EXT. BRITISH EVACUATION CAMP - ON NILE - DAY. WOUNDED BRITISH SOLDIERS lie in the open sun, moaning in agony, plagued by clouds of dust and swarms of flies. WILLOUGHBY stares out, numb to their suffering, thinking only of his own lost friends. The SHADOW OF A MAN in Arab robes hovers over him. WILLOUGHBY ...Get lost!... The ARAB doesn't move. wILLOUGHBY (Looking up furiously) Didn't you bloody hear me! Get lost!... WILLOUGHBY suddenly stops. He stares at the Arab as if in a dream. wILLOUGHBY ...Harry?... HARRY stares back at him through his black desert robes. HARRY I sent a man to you with a warning from Abou Klea. You wouldn't listen to him. You had him tortured instead. The confusion and shock bring pent-up tears to WILLOUGHBY's eyes. HARRY He told you a British Officer had sent him. Even if you didn't believe him, what would it have cost to take precautions. What more did I have to do? wILLOUGHBY (As the horror sinks in) I didn't know Harry...I didn't know it was you... (He still can't believe his eyes) ...What are you doing here in God's name?...What are you doing?... HARRY opens his hand to reveal a soiled white feather. WILLOUGHBY stares at it, in bewilderment at first,then slowly beginning to understand. wILLOUGHBY (He gazes at the feather as if it's the symbol of his own disgrace now) Give me the others. Give them to me. harry They're not yours to take back. WILLOUGHBY looks up at him through his tears. There's no condemnation in Harry's eyes, but no sympathy either. His experiences have changed him, turned him into a harder man. EXT. maze/ caroline's house - day. ETHNE gazes silently at the feathers in her hand. wILLOUGHBY ...He'd followed us all the way from Alexandria, looking for an opportunity to redeem himself. It was only after he left that I found out an Arab matching his description had also saved Jack Durrance's life. ETHNE looks up in surprise. willoughby Jack doesn't know. That was the way Harry wanted it. EXT. FLASHBACK/ BATTLEFIELD/ DESERT/ SUDAN - DAY. Smoke hovers over the corpse strewn battlefield. We see HARRY through the haze, carrying DURRANCE on his shoulders, staggering under his friend's weight. EXT. FLASHBACK/ HILLS ABOVE THE BATTLEFIELD/ SUDAN - DAY. HARRY and ABOU FATMA help DURRANCE up a steep mountain trail, as below them, the battle rages. EXT. FLASHBACK/ BANKS OF THE NILE/ SUDAN - DAY. DURRANCE's brow is beaded with sweat. HARRY cools his face with a wet cloth. DURRANCE murmurs questions in his feverish state, but HARRY remains resolutely silent. EXT. maze/ caroline's house - day. ETHNE stares at WILLOUGHBY, thinking only of Harry. WILLOUGHBY thinks she's staring at the medals on his chest. wILLOUGHBY (Embarrassed) I tried to turn them down. I told the committee I'd done nothing to deserve them. They didn't care. I think they pick their heroes' names out of a hat. (Trying to ease her pain) You asked me how he'd changed. All I can say is that you would have been proud of him. ETHNE I should have been proud of him before. Or at least I should have tried to understand. willoughby You can't blame yourself. ETHNE Why not, if you can. (She won't forgive herself) We all misjudged him, but I had the least excuse. He was the man I was supposed to love. Suddenly a voice calls out: DURRANCE O/s Ethne... They turn around, startled. DURRANCE stands at the entrance to the maze. WILLOUGHBY gets up nervously. ETHNE (Whispering urgently) Please, I don't want him to know you're here. WILLOUGHBY stops. DURRANCE looks in their direction. wILLOUGHBY (In disbelief) He can see us. ETHNE He can't see a thing. DURRANCE reaches out and feels the hedge, finding his bearings, taking slow steps into the maze: DURRANCE Ethne...? ETHNE keeps quiet. DURRANCE Ethne...? She watches DURRANCE, wracked with guilt. wILLOUGHBY (Beginning to panic) I've got to say something. ETHNE Be quiet. DURRANCE is only a few yards away from them now. He stares a moment, as if at ETHNE, then turns and walks back. EXT. window/ CAROLINE's house - day. CAROLINE sees DURRANCE, walking away from the maze, still calling out for Ethne. EXT. maze/ CAROLINE's house - day. Durrance's voice fades in the distance. ETHNE (Struggling with her emotions) I didn't want him to find out what you just told me. wILLOUGHBY Harry was his best friend -- ETHNE -- I'm engaged to Jack. I'm going to marry him. WILLOUGHBY stares in surprise. wILLOUGHBY ...I knew he'd proposed, I had no idea you'd accepted... (Considering the implications) ...I'd never have told you if I knew. I'm sure Harry wouldn't have wanted me to. ETHNE I'm glad you did. I needed to know. (Looking at him) Do you know where Harry is now? WILLOUGHBY hesitates. wILLOUGHBY He didn't tell me anything; I didn't feel I had a right to ask -- ETHNE -- Please, tell me the truth. There's no anger in her voice, only concern. WILLOUGHBY looks torn. wILLOUGHBY Some of our men were taken prisoner. The Dervishes took them South, in case we tried a rescue. Trench was among the missing. ETHNE smiles sadly, as if she has her answer. wILLOUGHBY (Trying to give her hope) Harry may be determined but he isn't mad. He'll look for Trench and then he'll come back. ETHNE He'll do whatever he has to do. There are still two feathers left. EXT. window/ caroline's house - day. From her window, CAROLINE sees ETHNE and WILLOUGHBY, saying goodbye, walking off in different directions. As ETHNE approaches the house, CAROLINE sees her gazing at something in her hand. INT. stairway/ caroline's house - day. CAROLINE walks down the stairs. CAROLINE Is everything alright? ETHNE (Forcing a smile) He was a friend of father's. He apologised for not introducing himself. He was in a hurry. CAROLINE doesn't press. She notices the two white feathers in Ethne's hand. INT. LIVING ROOM/ CAROLINE's house - night. ETHNE sits at the piano stool, still gazing at the feathers in her hand. She hears voices in the corridor. It's Durrance, asking Caroline where she is. ETHNE hears his footsteps approaching. She lifts up the piano lid and starts to play. The living room door opens. ETHNE ignores the quiet footsteps behind her. She feels DURRANCE listening to every note. His hands cover her eyes gently. ETHNE (Trying to smile) Who could that be... She removes his hands from her eyes, and kisses them. DURRANCE sits down beside her on the piano stool. DURRANCE What were you playing? ETHNE The Melusine overture. DURRANCE Cheerful stuff. He grins and starts to play the tune, perfectly. ETHNE looks on in admiration, trying to hide her feelings. DURRANCE Join me. ETHNE I'd rather listen. DURRANCE Please... Reluctantly ETHNE starts to accompany him. DURRANCE They say you can tell a woman's heart by the way she plays. ETHNE What if she can't play at all. DURRANCE It isn't how well you play, it's how passionately you stroke the keys. ETHNE presses the keys harder, pretending it's a joke, worried that he might see through her. DURRANCE I'd say you're in love. Even though it's said in jest, his words stick like a knife. The notes torture her. She suddenly gets up and walk away from the piano. DURRANCE (Following her footsteps) Where are you going? ETHNE I want to hear you play on your own. A moment's silence. Then DURRANCE turns back to the piano and starts to play -- quietly, tenderly. The haunting music breaks Ethne's heart. Almost involuntarily she starts to walk away from him, towards the open patio doors. DURRANCE (With a sudden flourish of the keys) There you go, I'm in love too... He swivels around and beams at her joyfully. ETHNE stares back at him, unable to speak. DURRANCE (Gazing at her adoringly) These past few days have been the best days of my life, blind or otherwise... His eyes shine in the candlelight, full of new-found hope. DURRANCE ...Before I came here I'd given up. I put on all kinds of fronts and defences, but deep down I was petrified. I had no idea what was going on around me, what people were thinking behind my back. I imagined the worst, so that nothing would surprise me, no-one would catch me out... He walks closer. DURRANCE ...You've made me realise I can't live like that. Whether one can see or not, there's no way of knowing how people really feel about you, all you can do is put yourself in their hands, and trust them unconditionally... ETHNE can't speak. DURRANCE I know how much you loved Harry... (A beat) ...for the first time I'm not afraid to admit it, I'm not not afraid to bring it up between us... (A beat) I'm not afraid, because of you Ethne, because of the way you've made me feel... He waits for an answer but all that greets him is silence. As he steps closer he suddenly loses her presence. A touch of panic enters his voice: DURRANCE Ethne...? The only sound he hears is the wind on the curtains. We see for the first time that Ethne's left, through the open patio doors. DURRANCE Ethne...? He turns around sharply as he hears a noise. CAROLINE stands in the doorway. DURRANCE walks towards her. DURRANCE (Touching her arm) I thought you'd disappeared. CAROLINE It's Caroline. Ethne's gone. DURRANCE pulls back, embarrassed. DURRANCE I'm sorry. CAROLINE She must be in the garden. DURRANCE (Trying to sound lighthearted) She was here a minute ago. It must have been something I said. CAROLINE (Every word is calculated) I don't think it was anything you said. She's been upset all afternoon. Ever since she spoke to Lieutenant Willoughby. DURRANCE Willoughby?... He looks perplexed. DURRANCE Willoughby was here? Why didn't he come and see me? CAROLINE I thought he did. I saw you walking into the maze to join them. She feels the impact on him -- the fact that he called out and no-one answered. DURRANCE (Trying to justify it to himself) He must have had his reasons. CAROLINE He brought her two white feathers. That's all I know. DURRANCE looks up, startled. DURRANCE ...Harry... CAROLINE watches his unseeing eyes trying to make sense of what's happened. She feels a touch of remorse as she sees him struggling with his emotions. Finally he looks up: DURRANCE Ethne obviously didn't want me to know... (Curiously) Why did you tell me? CAROLINE hesitates. CAROLINE I thought you should know. DURRANCE You're her friend. CAROLINE Yours too I hope. DURRANCE stares at her in silence, her intentions slowly becoming clear to him. DURRANCE You're not fair to Ethne. CAROLINE Are you? Her meaning is clear. Her words sting him deeply. DURRANCE How much of our conversation did you overhear? CAROLINE Enough. DURRANCE Then you should know I meant every word. (more with pity than anger) I love and trust Ethne unconditionally. Whatever doubts she's feeling, I know she'll resolve them. (With quiet dignity) I've put myself in her hands. A long silence. DURRANCE doesn't need to see CAROLINE to know she's in tears. CAROLINE ...The only reason I told you, was because you mean the world to me. DURRANCE (A gentle rebuff) I'm sorry, Mrs Adair. EXT. garden/ caroline's house - night. ETHNE sits in the garden alone, shivering in the wind, hating herself. EXT. THE CITY OF DONGOLA/ SOUTHERN SUDAN - night. The peeling CORPSE of a British soldier is dragged through the streets by a rope tied to a camel's back. LOCAL WOMEN tear at the dead man's uniform, grabbing at his testicles, spitting on his bloated face. HARRY slips out of the crowd, horrified by what he's seen, relieved it isn't Trench. EXT. DONGOLA/ SUDAN - day. The jeering women can be heard in the distance. ABOU FATMA sits in the shade, slurping an oily gruel. HARRY squats beside him. ABOU FATMA offers him the bowl. HARRY declines. ABOU FATMA You're surprised by the women? HARRY doesn't need to answer, his face says it all. ABOU FATMA They're always the most cruel. Amongst the Southern Tribes it's the custom for them to go into battle first, calling the men cowards until they're ready to fight. (Mischievously) It is the same in your country, no? HARRY looks up to find ABOU FATMA grinning at him. ABOU FATMA The woman you spoke of. Go back to her. Tell her you're ready. haRRY What did you find out about the British prisoners? ABOU FATMA There are very few of them left. He offers HARRY his food again. This time HARRY takes the bowl and swallows the rancid meat as if it's nothing. harrY Where are they being held? ABOU FATMA Your Army abandoned them. The shame is no longer yours. harry (Provoking him) Have I paid you for nothing, Abou Fatma? The Nubian looks up, stung by the talk of money, when he was only expressing concern. ABOU FATMA (Coldly) Twelve British soldiers were taken by boat from here to Omdurman last month. haRRY Shoukhran. ABOU FATMA You're a foolish man. Even for a British Officer. hARRY (Smiling) 'God protects the fool'. (Passing Abou Fatma the bowl) How would I get into the prison at Omdurman? ABOU FATMA (Sarcastically) Urinate in a holy well. harry That carries a penalty of death. All I want is to be imprisoned there. ABOU FATMA stops eating, realising HARRY is serious. ABOU FATMA You will die before your time. haRRY 'If it is the will of God.' ABOU FATMA (Impatient now) This man turned his back on you. Why should you give your life for his? harry Because he'd do the same for me. No matter what had passed between us. (Looking at the Nubian) I hope I'd do the same for you too. ABOU FATMA I have no need of such friends. The Nubian returns to his food, betraying no sentiment. HARRY reaches into his pocket and holds out five shilling coins. ABOU FATMA (Disdainfully) You owe me two shillings a day. This is too much. HARRY can't help smiling. haRRY You still haven't answered my question? ABOU FATMA You answered it yourself. God protects the fool. EXT. night MARKET/ outside the city of OMDURMAN - night. HARRY stumbles around the marketplace, strumming on a broken zither, pestering people for money, pretending to be mad. The passing crowds laugh at him and push him away. ABOU FATMA watches from across the street. HARRY staggers through the torchlit stalls. He sees a group of DERVISH WARRIORS, gathered around a fire. Their leader, a sickly looking EMIR, smokes a hashish pipe as he listens to his men recounting their feats of war. Next to him, lies a beautiful, jewel encrusted scabbard. HARRY thinks a moment, then approaches the group, strumming his zither, grinning at the men. Seeing the crazed musician, the DERVISH WARRIORS cover their ears. Some of them toss chunks of meat at him. HARRY picks up the dusty morsels, chewing them with relish, grinning like a happy puppy. ABOU FATMA watches as HARRY humiliates himself, playing his broken zither for the EMIR. The EMIR gazes back at him through bored, bloodshot eyes. As the WARRIORS laugh, HARRY suddenly bends down and snatches the Emir's scabbard. He runs off with it at speed, waving it around his head like a sword, yelling at the top of his voice. The DERVISH WARRIORS give chase, still laughing as they run after the lunatic. HARRY stumbles over a tent pole deliberately. The DERVISH WARRIORS swarm around him, caning him with their sticks. HARRY protects his face with his hands, pleading: harry (In Arabic) God loves the fool. God loves the fool... EXT. WELL/ outside the city of OMDURMAN - night. The whole marketplace has gathered to watch the madman punished. The WARRIORS hoist HARRY up onto a well, and shout at him to walk around the rim. Holding out his hands, HARRY starts to step around the ledge. As he glances down he sees the drop is at least thirty feet deep. Two of the WARRIORS jump onto the ledge behind him, blowing bugles in his ear. DERVISH WARRIORS (In Arabic) Faster thief...Faster... HARRY starts to walk faster, clapping in time with the WARRIORS, performing for the CROWD. harry (In Arabic) ...God loves the fool. God loves the fool... Another WARRIOR steps out of the crowd and starts prodding HARRY with his spear. The CROWD roars as HARRY almost topples into the well. He regains his footing and laughs back at them, clapping his hands, wriggling his hips. spectator's voiCE (In Arabic) Here's someone for him to dance with... HARRY looks down to see a hideous, half-naked HAG, being pushed towards him. The crowd clears a space for the two lunatics to dance. HARRY forces a crazed giggle as the HAG starts to undulate and thrust her hips at him. He echoes her movements, staring into her deadened eyes. The CROWD pushes them closer together. HARRY feels an overwhelming sense of pity and dread. The dreamlike intensity is getting to him. The tragic creature, shimmying before his eyes, is like a grotesque reminder of the woman he loved and lost. The HAG starts murmuring to herself. As he listens, HARRY realises she's singing -- a tuneless lament, remembered from long ago, sung without any understanding now. The emotion wells up in HARRY's eyes, even as he laughs at her. It's as if he's gazing into a crazy, distorted mirror. The EMIR stares curiously as he catches the emotion in Harry's eyes. He suddenly signals for his men to part the lunatics. HARRY is dragged away from the shrieking HAG, and flung before him. EMIR (In Arabic, suspicious now) Play for me fool... HARRY picks up his zither, and starts to play a tuneless din. EMIR (In Arabic) You're not mad. HARRY pretends not to understand. The EMIR suddenly cracks his cane down on Harry's hands, breaking his fingers. HARRY screams in agony: harry (In Arabic) ...God loves the fool... EMIR (In Arabic) The fool feels no pain. The EMIR beats him again with the cane. HARRY holds up his broken fingers in supplication, singing softly in his madman's gibberish. harry (In Arabic) ...God loves the fool... The EMIR's cane cracks open his face. He doubles over in agony, spitting out blood. ABOU FATMA watches, sickened, unable to do anything. Even the other spectators look shaken. HARRY slithers away in the dust, whimpering like an animal. EMIR (In Arabic) You're not mad. Tell me who are you? Tell me or I'll kill you... ABOU FATMA stares in silence, willing HARRY to speak. Many in the CROWD turn away, fearing the worst. The EMIR raises his cane. With a surge of effort, HARRY lifts up his blood soaked face, and grins at the EMIR. He looks barely human, his face ripped open, swollen beyond recognition. harry (Singing softly in Arabic) God loves the fool. God loves the fool... The EMIR hesitates, convinced nobody in their right mind could take this much pain. EMIR (In Arabic) He's mad. Take him to the prison. Let him sing for them there. He turns away and disappears into the crowd. ABOU FATMA stares at HARRY, with both pity and admiration. He whispers a prayer for his friend's safety. EXT. PRISON of OMDURMAN/ BANKS OF THE NILE - night. The evening prayers drift over the waters of the Nile. In the distance we see the prison of Omdurman, a huge dome of stone, surrounded by fifty foot walls on three sides, and the river itself on the fourth. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - night. Hundreds of shapes move forward in the darkness. At first they look like a herd of animals, but slowly we recognise the grunts and cries as human. Faces come at us out of the dark, screaming and cursing, shoving each other violently, raising their faces to the ceiling, gasping for air. As our eyes adjust to the light, the vision of hell intensifies. The PRISONERS are manacled and herded into a space no more than thirty feet wide. They circle the room in a clockwise direction, pushed on by each other in perpetual motion, afraid that if they stop they'll be sucked under the maelstrom and trampled underfoot. The most fortunate are those who've found a resting space in the corners of the room. They cling to the walls, fighting off anyone who tries to share their sanctuary. From somewhere amongst them we hear a familiar voice: trench Get away! This is Ibrahim's space! TRENCH protects his corner, lashing out at anyone who tries to breach the space. He bellows at the top of his voice: trENCH Ibrahim, where are you?! A voice answers from the heaving mass. TRENCH holds out his hand and drags his friend, IBRAHIM, out of the scrum. trench (Sounding half crazed) You mustn't fall. You musn't fall. As if to prove his point, a fight breaks out at the far side of the room. TRENCH stands on tiptoes, as eager as everyone else to see the outcome. TWO PRISONERS try to strangle each other with their chains, fighting for an inch of space. It's hard to make out anything in the dark, but the savagery of the fight is reflected in the speed of flailing fists and feet. One of the PRISONERS finally loses his footing. In an instant he's sucked under. The victor laughs maniacally. The loser's cries continue for a moment and then stop suddenly as the trampling feet break his neck. TRENCH turns to Ibrahim, with the knowing look of an expert. trench We mustn't fall Ibrahim. We musn't fall. Suddenly there's a cry from outside the cell door. prison guards o/s (In Arabic) Back! Get back! The PRISONERS closest to the door push away. The head guard, the towering IDRIS-ES-SAIER, tosses in a blazing torch to clear some space. A NEW PRISONER is flung inside and the door slammed shut behind him. The other PRISONERS surge back, trying to reclaim their space. There are cries of pain as some of them tread on the blazing torch. The sheer weight of men quickly puts it out. The NEW PRISONER holds onto anything he can to stop himself falling. From his corner TRENCH looks on grimly. treNCH Watch Ibrahim. He's going to fall. The NEW PRISONER is swept up in the savage wave. As he approaches TRENCH's corner he tries to claw his way to safety. TRENCH beats him back with a flurry of blows. The prisoner disappears under the heaving bodies, but then he pops up again, gasping for breath. He fights with all his might, swinging his fists, clutching at anyone in his way. TRENCH looks impressed, but he knows it won't be long. trench He'll fall. Youssef will get him. As the NEW PRISONER swings towards them again, the prisoner behind him, YOUSSEF, slams his chains down on his head. The new arrival goes down hard. As he disappears, he screams out the name: "Trench!!!" TRENCH stares in disbelief, frozen for a moment, then bellowing like a bull, he charges out of his corner and flails his way through the heaving mass, trying to retrieve the fallen prisoner. TRENCH Help me Ibrahim...!!! The tall Arab fights his way to Trench. Together they pull the NEW PRISONER to his feet. They take him under each arm and fall in with the moving mass. treNCH We've lost our place. You mustn't fall. The man almost collapses, but TRENCH holds him up. He and Ibrahim keep walking the prisoner, trying to keep him conscious, knowing they have to fight till daybreak now. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The sound of early morning prayers drifts into the House of Stone. Sunbeams pick out bloodmarks and broken nails where prisoners have tried to claw their way to safety. Half a dozen BODIES lie crushed on the floor, those who didn't make it through the night. Those who did, are ushered outside by the PRISON GUARDS, into the merciless heat. TRENCH and IBRAHIM support the NEW PRISONER. A fat, oily looking Prison Guard, HASSAN, sneers at TRENCH on his way out. HASSAN You've found a friend, English. TRENCH ignores him, blinking as he walks into the sun. EXT. courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The PRISONERS collapse as they stumble into the prison courtyard, exhausted by the previous night's efforts. TRENCH and IBRAHIM help the NEW PRISONER to the river's edge. EXT. RIVERBANK/ courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. TRENCH kneels beside the prisoner and pours some water over his face. The man opens his lips to swallow it. treNCH Don't drink. It's dirty. Your body isn't strong enough. Beads of sweat shine on the bearded man's ravaged face. TRENCH studies his features, wondering who he is. He digs out a copper coin from his shoe. treNCH (To Ibrahim) See if Hassan will sell us some drinking water. IBRAHIM sets off towards HASSAN, who's busy beating the other PRISONERS to their feet. treNCH (Looking back) You speak English? new prisoner (A trace of a smile appears on his cracked lips) ...I hope so, after all this time... TRENCH stares at him in surprise. treNCH ...How do you know my name? new PRISONER You told it to me yourself...the first time we met... (Imitating Trench weakly) "Trench by name, and Trench by nature. Good to meet you Feversham..." TRENCH stares in astonishment. trENCH ...Harry?... HARRY's eyes move around and find him, twinkling mischievously, despite all the pain. harrY (With ironic good humor) ...You look well... treNCH (Breaking into a smile) Not half as well as you... (Overwhelmed) What the hell are you doing here?... hARRY ...I'd come to rescue you...but now that you've rescued me...I have to save you twice... TRENCH stares at him in disbelief. hARRY ...I have some money to bribe the guards...There's a man waiting for us across the river...With camels and provisions... TREnch (Snapping out of his reverie, hushing him) Keep your voice down. TRENCH looks across the courtyard to make sure no-one's watching them. HASSAN is busy bargaining with IBRAHIM over the cup of water. treNCH (Under his breath) How much money? harRY Two hundred. TRENCH looks hopeful for the first time in weeks. TRENCH ...I knew it wasn't true. The guards kept telling me our army had left us behind. How far away are they? hARRY (Regrettably) They pulled out. Over a month ago. TRENCH stares in confusion. TRENCH Then who sent you? harrY You did. TRENCH doesn't understand. HARRY slowly opens his fingers to reveal a crushed white feather in his hand. TRENCH stares at it in bewilderment. Then suddenly he starts to laugh, full of anguish and joy, amazed by the madness of the world. EXT. PRISON GATES/ courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The compound gates rumble open. The Prisoners' RELATIVES are ushered inside, kept in order by the GUARDS' whips. The PRISONERS limp as fast as they can to receive any food their families have brought them. Before they can eat, the GUARDS have to be paid off, IDRIS first, then HASSAN and the others. As the feeding frenzy breaks out we hear Trench's voice: trENCH v/o ...Hassan's the only guard who's corruptible. For two hundred he'll get us on the graveyard detail... EXT. RIVERBANK/ courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. We see what he's talking about now. The dead bodies from the House of Stone are dumped in a row boat. The GUARDS order several PRISONERS onto the boat with them. They're too afraid to handle the corpses themselves. treNCH v/o ...The farthest the boat goes is a hundred yards from the opposite shore. We'll have to wait until you're strong enough to swim... HARRY watches the boat drift into the middle of the river. Ripples appear as huge CROCODILES move in to feed. The PRISONERS toss the bodies in the water. The corpses float for a moment, then suddenly vanish in a froth of blood. treNCH (Smiling grimly) You didn't think of that when you came? haRRY I didn't think of much when I came. TRENCH looks at him, still unable to believe anyone could be so reckless and so brave. trENCH All for a feather? hARRY (Lightly) More than one. TRENCH looks down at the sand, reflecting: trENCH Give it to me Harry. haRRY Why? treNCH So I can show you it means nothing -- that if I throw it in the river it'll float away -- end up between some Croc's teeth. harry (Smiling softly) Not this feather. It's got the measure of me. It'll float back and find me. The water laps quietly in the silence. trENCH There were a dozen British Officers here last month. Every time one of them died, the last words on his lips were: "Don't worry about me lads. Our boys will come and get you." They never did. Just you. I'd say you've done enough. haRRY Not until I get you out. trENCH You can hardly walk. harry I don't need to walk, I need to swim. He smiles at TRENCH affectionately. Across the river, the boat returns, silhouetted against the sunset. EXT. house of stone/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The PRISONERS are herded back into the House of Stone. HASSAN walks alongside TRENCH and HARRY, negotiating his bribe. hASSAN ...God put you here for a reason, English. He tests us. I have fifteen starving children myself to care for. treNCH (Taking his cue) I was thinking of your children Hassan. I'd like to help them. God favours the almsgiver. hASSAN For three hundred I could feed them for a year. treNCH I can afford two. From myself, Ibrahim, and the madman. HASSAN nods, accepting the offer, and walks ahead. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - night. HARRY and TRENCH are in the thick of the crowd, fighting for space, trying to give each other strength. treNCH ...The first thing I do when I get back is book a table at Wilton's. A private room, all to myself, no bloody crowds... He shoves into the man in front, gaining a few more precious inches for them to breathe in. trench ...I'll start with a half shell of crab, then I'll order the mallard, medium rare. harRY A glass of Burgundy to wash it down. treNCH Nothing foreign. A pint of Stout'll do me fine. harrY (Grinning) Well I'm getting on the first train to Bintree, crowded or not. trENCH I'll drink to that... (He raises his hand, as if he's in a crowded pub, trying to get the Barman's attention) Two pints please... The two of them surge through the crowd, laughing like lunatics. treNCH A few more days Harry. A few more days... INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The morning call to prayer brings sobs of relief from the PRISONERS. HARRY, TRENCH, and IBRAHIM, lie in a corner of the room, exhausted by the night's efforts. HASSAN steps over the dead bodies littering the floor, and orders them to get up. hassAN (As planned) You three, take the bodies to the boat. HARRY and IBRAHIM get to their feet. TRENCH doesn't move. HARRY reaches down to give him a hand, when he suddenly sees how pale his friend is. He drops to his knees, feeling TRENCH's pulse. He's alive, but very weak. hasSAN (Looking at the unconscious Trench) You see, English. God didn't want you to leave. He has given you Umm Sabbah. TRENCH moans, gripped by Typhus fever. HARRY tries to help him up, refusing to believe their plans are dashed. hARRY (Whispering) Trench, get up. Get up... hassAN (Shouting at Harry in Arabic) Leave him. Carry the dead to the boat. HARRY ignores him, cradling TRENCH in his arms. HASSAN steps forward and lashes him hard across the back. harry (Still trying to rouse Trench) ...Get up Trench. Get up... HASSAN lashes him again. This time HARRY spins around and grabs the whip. He stares at HASSAN dangerously, the frustration and disappointment pushing him to the edge. HASSAN (In Arabic) He paid me to release you. If you don't want to go, you can rot with him. (Turning to Ibrahim) What about you?! IBRAHIM looks at TRENCH guiltily, then gets up, and walks towards the dead bodies. HARRY gathers TRENCH in his arms, and holds him protectively, like a faithful slave. HASSAN sneers, and strides out of the House of Stone. HARRY looks at TRENCH. His friend shivers feverishly. HARRY brushes the wet hair out of his face: hARRY We'll get you to Wilton's. Crab and Mallard, medium rare. EXT. RIVERBANK/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY watches from the shore, as IBRAHIM tosses the corpses overboard. Suddenly the Arab takes his chance and dives. He's only yards away from the boat when he's lifted into air by a huge crocodile, and dragged below the murky depths. All is still again. HARRY looks back at TRENCH, lying by the river's edge, lost in his own feverish dreams. INT. STUDY/ GENERAL FEVERSHAM's HOUSE/ LONDON - DAY. ETHNE sits across from GENERAL FEVERSHAM in the dimly lit room. There's bright sunshine outside but very little of it gets in. GENERAL FEVERSHAM seems much older than the first time we saw him, his eyes are withdrawn, his movements restless. He rings the handbell irritably. ETHNE Don't worry about the biscuits General. gENERAL FEVERSHAM I wanted some myself. I need something sweet in the afternoons, otherwise I fall asleep. (Catching himself) Not today of course. ETHNE tries to answer his smile, but neither of them is particularly convincing. gENERAL FEVERSHAM I'm very touched you've come all this way to tell me your good news. Jack'll make you a wonderful husband. ETHNE (Hiding all her doubts) He'll be pleased to hear that. gENERAL FEVERSHAM I'm very fond of the boy. GENERAL FEVERSHAM smiles weakly, and looks away. Whatever they talk about seems to come back to Harry. ETHNE finally broaches the subject: ETHNE Have you heard any news from the Sudan? GENERAL FEVERSHAM hesitates. gENERAL FEVERSHAM ...An old friend of mine came to visit me yesterday, Colonel Sutch. You probably remember him... ETHNE nods, panicking inside, sensing the old man's grief. gENERAL FEVERSHAM ...He used to receive the occasional letter from Harry, letting him know that he was alright... (His voice falters) ...Harry made him promise not to tell me anything, unless the letters stopped. I'm afraid they did. Over a month ago. ETHNE looks pale. She tries to hold back her tears for the General's sake. ETHNE I'm sure it doesn't mean anything. gENERAL FEVERSHAM I asked some friends at the war office to make some enquiries. According to their spies, all the British prisoners are dead. ETHNE can't speak. The old man fights his tears as well. gENERAL FEVERSHAM Would you like to see his letters? ETHNE (Barely a whisper) I'm not sure I could cope right now. geNERAL FEVERSHAM No, of course not. I'm sorry... ETHNE looks up, remembering his grief is as great as hers. ETHNE Have you looked at them? gENERAL FEVERSHAM Oh yes. They make wonderful reading... (His face lights up briefly) He travelled all the way from Alexandria to Suakin. Across three hundred miles of desert. From there he followed the camel corp disguised as a coolie. He fought with them at Abou Klea, excelled himself by all accounts, saved dozens of lives. If he was still a soldier they'd have probably given him the Victoria Cross. ETHNE (Her eyes shining with tears) You must be very proud. The old man nods, suffering again. geNERAL FEVERSHAM ...There isn't a trace of fear in the writing. That's what I find so hard to understand. That someone could be so terrified of going to war; and yet when the time comes to face it for real, he embraces it, almost gratefully... ETHNE (Sharing his guilt) We all misjudged him. gENERAL FEVERSHAM You only knew him a short time. I had no excuse. Seeing him overcome by guilt and grief, ETHNE gets up and takes his hand. GENERAL FEVERSHAM holds hers tightly. gENERAL FEVERSHAM My son loved Jack Durrance like a brother. I know he'd be happy for you. He'd want you to live your lives. ETHNE nods gratefully, unable to speak, her whole world falling apart. EXT. courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The PRISONERS tear and claw at each other like wild animals, desperately trying reach a scrap of meat that's fallen to the floor. HARRY is in the thick of the fighting, elbowing and head-butting people out of his way. He's changed beyond recognition, and it isn't just physical. He fights with a primal savagery, oblivious to everything except the precious scrap of food. He finally gets hold of it, and swings his elbow round, breaking another PRISONER's nose. EXT. RIVER's EDGE/ courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. TRENCH lies by the riverside, sweating and shivering from fever, his eyes sunken back into his skull. HARRY kneels beside him, covered in blood. He holds out the scrap of meat. hARRY ...Trench. Food. You have to eat. TRENCH can't move his jaw, let alone eat. HARRY chews the meat for him. When it's soft between his teeth, he spits it out, and feeds TRENCH with his fingers. For all the primal horror, there's a touching human tenderness in the moment. Suddenly a pair of hands grab HARRY by the hair, and drag him away from TRENCH. It's IDRIS. The giant prison guard tears the scrap of meat from HARRY's hands and kicks him in the ribs for good measure. Spitting out blood, HARRY crawls after him, no longer having to play the madman, he's halfway there. hARRY (In Arabic) Food master, food master please... IDRIS lashes him with his whip. HARRY's body arches in pain but his brain hardly registers. He kisses the ground at Idris's feet, still begging for his scrap of food back. hARRY (In Arabic) Food master. Food... IDRIS walks away in disgust. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - night. HARRY holds up the semi-conscious TRENCH, as they're buffeted around in the House of Stone. The other PRISONERS try to push them under, but HARRY defends TRENCH with the savagery of a veteran. A PRISONER tries to blind TRENCH with his hands, but HARRY grabs his fingers, sinking his teeth in as far as they will go. INT. house of stone/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. Daylight streams through the open doors. HARRY rests TRENCH against a wall, and scavenges amongst the bodies of the dead, searching for any money they may have hidden. EXT. courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY runs over to HASSAN, and drops to his knees in supplication, holding out a copper coin: hARRY (Pleading in Arabic) Food master. Food. My master needs food. HASSAN holds out his arm to reveal a stump where his hand should be. hasSAN (In Arabic) This is what Idris gave me for helping your master... (Spitting at Harry's feet) There's some food. HASSAN turns and walks towards the fortress gates. The other PRISONERS scramble after him, desperate to receive their daily handout from their RELATIVES. HARRY thinks about wading in and fighting them for it, but he has no energy left. He collapses in the sand, staring up at the sun. As he closes his eyes, he suddenly hears a whisper: ARAB BOY o/s English... HARRY looks up to see a small ARAB BOY, approaching him. The BOY stops as he sees HARRY's ravaged face, frightened by his mad, staring eyes. HARRY sees the piece of chicken in his hand, and waves him over. The ARAB BOY finally kneels down, and offers him the chicken bone. HARRY snatches it and gnaws on it like a hungry animal. It's only when he examines the meat, making sure there's enough left for Trench, that we realise how human he still is. He slips the half eaten chicken bone in his robes, and looks at the ARAB BOY gratefully. The ARAB BOY holds out some coins for him. ARAB BOY From Abou Fatma. HARRY stares at the coins. It's all the money he's ever paid Abou Fatma. harrY Money's no good anymore. We can't bribe the guards. I need him to buy food and medecine for my friend... He stops as he realises the ARAB BOY doesn't understand a word. He gives him back the coins: harrY (In Arabic) Tell Abou Fatma to buy us food. You bring me the food... He points to the other RELATIVES as if to explain. The ARAB BOY nods that he understands. HARRY is about to ask him more when he suddenly spots IDRIS walking towards them menacingly. harrY Go. Thank Abou Fatma. Thank him for me. The ARAB BOY gets up and walks away. HARRY watches him leave, already missing the human contact. As IDRIS approaches, he scrambles away, reduced to his bestial state again. EXT. courtyard/ RIVERside/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY pours water over TRENCH's face. hARRY ...You're better Trench. Much better. You may not feel it, but you look it... TRENCH opens his eyes, conscious enough for the first time in weeks, to see how much his friend has changed. treNCH (Smiling weakly) ...When I'm better...Will I look as bad as you?... HARRY smiles through bleeding gums and swollen cheeks. The evening prayer starts up behind them. TRENCH closes his eyes in despair. treNCH I don't think of God anymore when I hear that sound. It used to give me hope. Now all I feel is dread. hARRY Don't talk like that. We're going to get you through this. treNCH I don't want to get through this, Harry. What for? In the distance they hear IDRIS shouting at the prisoners, driving them back into the House of Stone. TRENCH ...There's only one thing that frightens me now. The thought that the closer I come, the more desperately afraid and sure I am that all this will end right here... when I so wish I could die at home... (fighting tears) In my own country -- in my own village...to be buried beneath the trees I know -- in sight of the church and houses I know...beside the trout stream, where I fished when I was a boy... (Trying to smile) Are you laughing yet?... HARRY No, I'm not laughing. HARRY fights his own pain. treNCH I don't think I can take it anymore, Harry... HARRY finds it hard to argue. Staring at TRENCH's ravaged face and withered body all he can do is nod in sympathy. EXT. courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY sits opposite the young ARAB BOY in the courtyard. There's a look of quiet resignation in his eyes as he stares at the small glass vial in his hand. hARRY (In Arabic) Thank Abou Fatma for me. Ask him to pray for us. The ARAB BOY nods sadly, as if he's seeing Harry for the last time. HARRY pats him on the shoulder, and gets up. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - night. HARRY and TRENCH lean against a wall, watching as the House of Stone fills with PRISONERS. TRENCH's eyes are filled with dread. hARRY (Quietly) ...We had a visitor today. TRENCH turns and looks at him. HARRY opens his hand to reveal the small glass vial. TRENCH stares at the dark liquid inside, slowly realising what it is. TRENCH Anything would be better than this. HARRY Are you sure? TRENCH nods, his decision made. hARRY (Slipping him the vial) The poison will take a few hours to work. You won't feel any pain. TRENCH (Smiling grimly) That'll make a change. HARRY looks at him sadly, then turns away, preparing for the inevitable charge from the other PRISONERS. trENCH ...One last thing, Harry... HARRY turns around. trENCH ...My feather...I'd like it back... HARRY stares in silence. TRENCH holds out his hand. HARRY takes it. As they finally let go, we see the soiled white feather in TRENCH's palm. TRENCH closes his fingers around it, gratefully. treNCH I hope it gives me as much strength as it gave you. Their eyes stay on each other, full of friendship and respect. Then, steeling himself, TRENCH snaps the vial, and starts to drink. HARRY Half... TRENCH stops. trENCH (Smiling sadly) I didn't mean to be a pig about it... He holds out the vial for Harry. HARRY takes it and swallows the rest of the poison. He grins at TRENCH. hARRY What do you say, we give them one last night of hell. trENCH I'll drink to that. Shoulder first, HARRY charges into the massing PRISONERS. TRENCH follows him, laughing through his tears. INT. HOUSE OF STONE - DAWN. Blinding sunlight. The PRISONERS stumble out of the House of Stone, covered in blood from the previous night's fighting. IDRIS looks down at the broken bodies at his feet. HARRY and TRENCH are amongst the dead. IDRIS prods them both with his spear, making sure. IDRIS (In Arabic) Take them to the boats. EXT. courtyard/ RIVERside/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. A dozen BODIES are dumped, one on top of the other, in two funeral boats. HASSAN takes charge of one, IDRIS the other. EXT. BOATS/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The GUARDS hold onto the sides of the boat, steadying themselves in case a crocodile tries to ram. The PRISONERS charged with throwing the bodies overboard, stare into the water, terrified of the unseen monsters lurking below. EXT. hassan's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The corpses are piled high in Hassan's boat, a mass of chalk white flesh. As we follow a rivulet of blood into the heap, we see Harry's face. His eyes suddenly open. Very much alive. They move around, trying to locate Trench. Above him he feels the corpses being lifted off, easing the burden on his back. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. Arrows break the surface, as the giant crocodiles move in. EXT. hassan's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY finally glimpses TRENCH. His friend is still unconscious. In tiny movements, HARRY slips through the ice cold flesh that separates them, and slides over TRENCH's body, trying to ensure he's thrown overboard first. EXT. idris's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. Blood boils around the boats as more bodies are tossed overboard. As IDRIS stares into the murky depths, he sees a fifteen foot monster, dragging away a translucent corpse. EXT. hassan's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY and TRENCH are the only bodies left in Hassan's boat. HARRY braces himself as he's lifted into the air. His body is swung out three times and thrown overboard. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY feels the warm water envelop him. Any trace of paralysis the poison has left, disappears in an instant, driven away by sheer terror. Through the eerie green haze he glimpses the dreamlike silhouettes of the crocodiles, feasting on the corpses, dragging them along the river bed. HARRY's instincts are to swim away as fast as he can, but even now he remembers TRENCH. The water above him explodes as TRENCH is hurled in. HARRY swims up to the surface and grabs hold of his friend. EXT. idris's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS stares curiously as he watches the two bodies drifting away. The water around them is bubbling but there's no blood. It's only as he looks more closely that IDRIS realises one of the bodies is kicking his feet, swimming away. iDRIS (In Arabic) Hassan. Behind you! EXT. HASSAN's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HASSAN turns around to see HARRY and TRENCH disappearing with the current. He takes out his pistol. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. Holding the unconscious TRENCH in his arms, HARRY swims towards the fastest point of the river, hoping the current will drag him away from the crocodiles and the boats. EXT. HASSAN's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HASSAN aims the pistol with his good hand. He's about to squeeze the trigger, when there's a loud explosion from the opposite shore. A bullet smashes through his skull and hurls him into the water. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The MAN who fired the shot lowers his rifle. It's ABOU FATMA. He kicks his camel, and gallops along the riverbank, trying to keep up with HARRY and TRENCH in the water. EXT. IDRIS's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS stares after them in fury. He orders the GUARDS to row into the current and give chase. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY and TRENCH tumble through the churning water, the current boiling all around them. There are splashes of water as bullets explode. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. ABOU FATMA dismounts as he sees HARRY and TRENCH being picked off. He takes up a position near the riverbank, and fires at the pursuing boat. EXT. IDRIS's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS ducks as one of his GUARDS is hit. He shouts at the remaining GUARDS to fire back at Abou Fatma. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY and TRENCH keep disappearing under the water. As he surfaces briefly, HARRY looks around. He sees the current hurtling towards a row of jagged rocks. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS aims at the distant figure on the riverbank, and fires a volley of shots. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. Two bullets spin ABOU FATMA round, grazing him in the leg, knocking the rifle out of his hand. Limping as fast as he can, he takes cover behind the camels. EXT. IDRIS's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS looks back at HARRY and TRENCH, ready to pick them off. Suddenly his eyes stop. He sees the jagged rocks in his path. He yells at the GUARDS to row against the current. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The current picks up speed as it hurtles towards the rocks. HARRY holds TRENCH tightly, anticipating the impact. The current sweeps them right through the rocks. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. ABOU FATMA watches from the riverbank as IDRIS's boat tumbles helplessly towards the rocks. EXT. IDRIS's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The GUARDS leap off the boat at the last moment, but the current sweeps them up, and dashes their brains against the rocks. Only IDRIS holds on. The boat breaks up all around him, but protects him from the full impact. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY and TRENCH surface on the other side of the rocks. Huge tree roots jut out near the riverbank. The current is still strong but it's swimmable. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. ABOU FATMA rides after the disappearing bodies. EXT. GIANT TREE ROOT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY reaches out and grabs a jutting tree root. With his legs clamped around TRENCH, he pulls them out of the fastest point of the current. As he looks behind him he sees IDRIS disappear under the torrent. Catching his breath, HARRY starts to clamber along the root, trying to make it to the safety of the riverbank. TRENCH groans, fully conscious now. harrY We're going to make it. TRENCH stares at HARRY with an almost childlike trust. harrY See if you can touch the bottom. TRENCH dips his feet under, nodding as they touch the riverbed. harrY Grab the root. TRENCH grips the root. HARRY swims around him. harry Now walk to the riverbank. treNCH My legs are broken. harry Your legs are fine. The poison paralyses the body. It's worn off. Gripping the root, TRENCH starts to walk against the current, the water flowing up to his neck. Slowly the river shallows. HARRY looks relieved as his friend finally tumbles onto the riverbank and collapses. He's about to follow him, when suddenly a pair of hands shoot out of the water, and grab him around the neck. It's IDRIS. He's also managed to clamber his way to safety. With a howl of rage he pulls HARRY's face under the water. HARRY kicks and flails. With one huge hand IDRIS keeps him under the surface, with the other he holds onto the giant tree root. HARRY tries to loosen his grip, but he isn't strong enough. He reaches down into the riverbed, and gropes around until he finds a rock. He grinds it into IDRIS's wrist like a pummel stone. IDRIS whips his hand away in pain. HARRY is instantly sucked out of his grasp. The current smashes him headlong into another root, downriver. IDRIS stares at his escaped prey in fury. His anger clouds his reason. He lets go of his own root and lets the current drag him to HARRY's. EXT. RIVERbank/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY drags himself towards the riverbank. He's only a few yards away when IDRIS's hands grab him again. HARRY turns around swinging and catches IDRIS on the jaw. Both of them tumble in the water. They wrestle beneath the surface, then shoot up again, tearing at each other like wild animals. IDRIS grabs HARRY by the hair, and slams his face down on his knee, smashing his nose. The searing pain staggers HARRY. He tries to crawl away, but IDRIS stamps on his back, flattening him. He drops to his knees, and grinds HARRY's face into the riverbed. As he pulls him back up by the hair, we see HARRY's mangled features -- a mask of blood, eyes staring out, jaws hanging open in defeat. For a moment time seems to slow, then suddenly, shaking his head free, HARRY screams a savage, primal cry, and drives his elbow back into IDRIS's face, shattering bone and cartilege. IDRIS falls back, stunned. HARRY has his chance to get away, but he's not interested now. He wades after IDRIS, an expression of pure, uncontrollable rage in his eyes. As IDRIS tries to pick himself up, HARRY slams both fists into his mouth, smashing his teeth down his throat. It's IDRIS's turn to look scared. He tries to crawl away, but the bloody faced demon is on him in seconds, ramming his head back under the water. IDRIS manages to kick him away briefly, but it only enrages HARRY. He comes back at IDRIS with a large rock between his hands, cracking his face open. And still he isn't finished. Sitting astride the gurgling prison guard, HARRY raises both arms as high as they'll go, and smashes the rock into IDRIS's face, again and again. The guard's blood splatters all over him, but HARRY hardly seems to notice. He's gripped by a savage, primordial fury. Everything he's suffered has built up to this point. He's at his highest and lowest ebb. His hands whirr up and down, his eyes glow feverishly, his lips curl in a terrifying sneer. Strong arms grab him from behind, but HARRY ignores them, hammering away. He's beyond hatred, beyond compassion, face to face with his deepest, darkest self. Again the arms try to pull him off, but HARRY brushes them aside. The blood and tears stream down his cheeks. He howls like an animal. His hands finally slow as his arms reach exhaustion. This time ABOU FATMA manages to pull him off. HARRY collapses in his arms and weeps like a baby, finally breaking out of the darkness, no longer sure who or what he is anymore. ABOU FATMA holds him tightly, hushing him, comforting him, understanding. EXT. country lane/ bintree/ england - day. A primal silence. Mist hovers over the emerald fields. In the distance a carriage approaches. As it draws nearer, we see HARRY, sitting in the back. His scars have healed, but his eyes have the far away look of someone who's seen too much. The outlines of the village church appear through the fog. HARRY hears a dog barking. hARRY (To the Driver) Could you stop here. EXT. church/ bintree - day. The barking grows louder as HARRY enters the churchyard. He sees a Collie, tied to a post. It's Dermod's dog. HARRY bends down and strokes the animal. Then he looks up through the open church door. INT. church/ bintree - day. At first HARRY doesn't see ETHNE. She sits quietly in one of the Church pews. It's only as she hears his footsteps that she turns around. Her eyes stop still. She stares at him in silence, taking in the ravages of time. All the diffidence and boyish charm she remembers have long since disappeared. In their place, there's an inner strength, and confidence. ETHNE Everyone said how much you'd changed. I didn't believe them. hARRY Do I look that bad? ETHNE Trench came to see me last week. He looked a good deal worse than you. hARRY He's suffered more. ETHNE That isn't what he told me. She stares at him with quiet pride. ETHNE May I have it back? hARRY That isn't why I came. ETHNE I'd still like it back. (She smiles sadly) I have three of them, I'd like four. HARRY stares at her, then takes out the fourth feather. hARRY I'm almost sorry to let it go. It's brought me a lot of luck these past few months. ETHNE takes the feather, unable to look at him. She stares at it in silence. ETHNE When did you get back? hARRY Two weeks ago. She looks hurt that it's taken him so long to come and see her, but she knows she has no right to expect more. ETHNE I'm glad you did what you did, on your own, without anyone's help. I'm glad for you, Harry. hARRY I did nothing on my own. You were with me the whole time. The tears begin to shine in her eyes. ETHNE You've heard our news?... hARRY Yes. ETHNE nods, unable to continue. hARRY I didn't come here to change your mind. (With quiet dignity) The most I hoped for -- and I hoped for it every day -- was that I could do enough to save the memory of what we had. So that you wouldn't always be ashamed of the time we spent together. ETHNE is too ashamed of herself to answer him. Her eyes drift to a crack of sunlight on the church wall, glinting through the stained glass windows. hARRY What are you thinking? ETHNE You'd laugh if I told you. harrY That might not be a bad thing. ETHNE I was thinking I'd get up and leave when that patch of sunlight disappeared. So far it's been quite resilient. She smiles gently. For a moment they're the Harry and Ethne of old. ETHNE I passed by your appartment the other day. hARRY (Surprised) When? ETHNE When you didn't come and see me... (She smiles sadly) I was in London for the day. It took me hours to pluck up the courage. When I finally drove by, your lights were off. hARRY I've hardly been out since I got back. ETHNE It was last Friday. Between five and six. hARRY (Pausing) I'd gone to see my father. ETHNE (Smiling ironically) Someone must be watching over us. The sunlight lingers precariously on the wall. ETHNE It will pass. You'll meet someone soon. Then you and her, and Jack and I, will sit over tea and chatter politely, as if there was never anything between us. hARRY That won't happen. ETHNE It has to happen. (The tears fill her eyes) Because I love you Harry...and I can't. I can't. The sunlight on the wall finally fades. ETHNE wipes her tears and gets up to leave. As she tries to walk past him, HARRY takes her in his arms. She doesn't resist. If anything she's relieved. They stay like that for a moment, holding each other, unable to do anything else. We feel their desperate longing, but there's a self imposed wall that keeps them apart. ETHNE pulls away gently. ETHNE I'll take you to the station. He nods. hARRY I wanted to look in on Jack. I'll leave him a note. ETHNE (Considering) No, he'd love to see you. He's staying at the vicarage. It's on the way. They're polite around each other now, like strangers. ETHNE slips past him with an awkward smile. HARRY waits before he follows her. They walk down the aisle, several feet apart. INT. DURRANCE's room/ vicarage/ glenalla - day. DURRANCE sits at a table, knotting his tie. There's a determination in his eyes, as if the smallest activity has become a battle to be won. Suddenly he hears the noise of Ethne's carriage outside. His face lights up. He feels his way towards the window. The carriage door takes a long time to open. DURRANCE stares curiously. Finally he hears footsteps on the gravel. They're heavier than he expected. They stop a moment. DURRANCE knows whoever it is, is staring up at him in the window. He looks thoughtful now, as if he knows who it is. He turns away from the window and finds a chair. He sits, facing the door, checking to make sure the carafe of Scotch and the crystal glasses are within easy reach. The footsteps climb the stairs. There's a knock on the door. DURRANCE Come in. HARRY enters. He stops as he sees his friend. DURRANCE's face has softened from inactivity. His skin seems pale compared to Harry's coarse, sunburnt features. DURRANCE It's good to see you, Harry. hARRY (Quietly impressed) How did you know? DURRANCE A calculated guess. (He grins) Scotch alright? hARRY Perfect. DURRANCE I've got to cut down on the stuff. I'm putting on weight. hARRY You look good. DURRANCE Not as good as you, I'm sure. HARRY watches his friend, taking the carafe, pouring two perfect glasses. Everything Durrance does, is designed to show him he's alright, that there's nothing to pity. DURRANCE (Handing him the drink) I heard Ethne's carriage outside? hARRY She's giving me a ride to the station. DURRANCE Why didn't she come up? hARRY (He knows the question isn't as casual as it sounds) I think she wanted to give us a few minutes alone. DURRANCE Do we need a few minutes alone? Even though he's smiling, the air is thick with tension. hARRY I came to thank you, Jack. DURRANCE For what? hARRY For standing by me. DURRANCE If you're talking about the feathers, I wasn't there. hARRY Willoughby told me you were. He said you'd tried to talk them out of it. DURRANCE hesitates. DURRANCE You don't owe me anything Harry. The wedding isn't for another month. Ethne's free to make up her own mind. hARRY You don't owe me anything either, Jack. And she's made up her mind. You should trust her judgement. A long silence. DURRANCE is too proud to respond. HARRY stares at his friend, regretting the wall between them. hARRY I'd better go. I'll miss my train. I'll come and see you soon. He finishes his drink and gets up. DURRANCE Have another one. hARRY I can't Jack. DURRANCE Please. His voice is softer now, more conciliatory. DURRANCE The friendship was the best thing about that place. It's the one thing I haven't been able to hang onto. It's his way of asking Harry to stay. HARRY sits again. DURRANCE I've become like one of those old soldiers we used to laugh at. Forcing my stories on everyone. Enough medals on my uniform to light up a Christmas tree. (Filling their glasses) Have they given you back your commission? hARRY They haven't acknowledged me in any way. DURRANCE I suppose it wouldn't be the British Army if they admitted their mistakes. hARRY I don't know if it was a mistake. I was never a real soldier like you. DURRANCE A real soldier doesn't come back in a hospital ship. (Raising his glass) To Castelton and all the others we left behind. HARRY watches his friend down his whisky, sensing the guilt and pain inside. hARRY (Reassuring him gently) You did everything you could. DURRANCE You saw it happen? hARRY From a distance. I remember the entire British Square retreating in perfect order, and then these two lunatics, charging out to save their friend. (He smiles affectionately) I remember thinking there wasn't a bullet in the world that could stop you that day. DURRANCE (Ironically) Except my own. hARRY You obviously weren't meant to die. You certainly tried your best. DURRANCE chuckles, close to tears, holding them back. DURRANCE It's hard to talk like this with anyone else. They all want to know how many people you've killed, but the moment you mention the friends you've lost, their eyes glaze over. hARRY They weren't there. DURRANCE No. (A beat) Do you ever miss the desert Harry? hARRY I'm glad I'm home. DURRANCE It was the best time of my life. Whenever anyone had a problem they came to me. I never felt so needed. __ (He smiles) Maybe we should change places. HARRY isn't sure what he means. DURRANCE tops up their glasses. DURRANCE You remember the first time we led a cavalry charge in public? hARRY You wiped the floor with me. Most of my horses ended up in the bandstand. DURRANCE Ethne was watching. hARRY (Hesitating) That's right. DURRANCE We'd met her the previous night, at the regimental ball. hARRY I remember. DURRANCE You should. You were the only one she danced with. HARRY smiles but doesn't say anything. DURRANCE I've never been so jealous. I stayed up all night brooding. The next day I was determined to show you up -- prove to her I was the better soldier. hARRY (Affectionately) You were always the better soldier. DURRANCE And it still didn't make a difference. (He smiles wistfully) She was the first person I looked for in the crowd, and she was staring at you. Everyone else was applauding me, and she was staring at you. (A beat) I'm not sure if anything's changed. HARRY can't speak. He knows what DURRANCE is saying. DURRANCE (Raising his glass) To us Harry. He leans over, grinning, and touches Harry's glass. DURRANCE To you. EXT. churchyard/ glenalla - day. Church bells chime, drowned out by the excited GUESTS. The Wedding party has gathered outside the chapel, waiting for the bride. There's a flurry of activity as Ethne's carriage finally draws up. FRIENDS and FAMILY run over to greet her. HARRY's PARTY stays behind at the Church door, preparing him for her imminent arrival. GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH make last minute adjustments to HARRY's suit and tie. WILLOUGHBY reminds TRENCH to make sure he's still got the ring. ETHNE finally emerges from the carriage, looking radiant in a white dress. HARRY tries to catch a glimpse of her, but TRENCH covers his eyes, as if it's still bad luck to see his bride. ETHNE laughs as she walks past them into the church, accompanied by her FATHER. TRENCH waits until she's safely inside, before he removes his hands from Harry's eyes. HARRY looks around, hoping to see Durrance amongst the crowd. His friend is nowhere to be seen. HARRY smiles at the other GUESTS, but he seems distracted, as if he knows in his heart Durrance won't show. Slowly the CROWD outside thins until only HARRY, TRENCH, and WILLOUGHBY remain. trENCH Ready? HARRY has one last look for Durrance, still hoping against hope, then he nods and follows his friends inside. The noise of the choir fades as the doors close behind them. For a moment we're left in the balmly stillness of the churchyard, and then, in it's place, we hear the unmistakeable whisper of the desert wind. FADE OUT. CUT TO: INT. BACK ROOM - CHURCH AT GLENALLA - DAY (CHURCH ORGAN OVER) 155 In full dress uniforms, Colonel Sutch and General Feversham work Harry over -- adjusting his collar: GENERAL FEVERSHAM All set... looking good. HARRY (mock nautical) Aye, sir. GENERAL FEVERSHAM That's enough out of you... As they shove him through the door -- turning back to Sutch: HARRY By the way, I must remember to thank you... (pause) For telling everyone I was dead. SUTCH I've never been so happy to be wrong in all my life. But I did what I thought was right.. HARRY A terrible habit. (beat) Raises all kinds of hell... As he heads out through the door, with the ORGAN PLAYING: "THE WEDDING MARCH..." SERIES OF SHOTS (MUSIC OVER): 156 - THE CHAPEL: is filled with MILITARY MEN; Feversham family and friends; Mrs. Adair; and a church full of locals. - HARRY'S POV - ON ETHNE: walking down the aisle -- as beautiful as a bride can be. DISSOLVE TO: - HARRY AND ETHNE: kissing at the altar -- joined together as man and wife, as... GENERAL FEVERSHAM (v.o.) (bellows) Officers... CUT TO: EXT. CHURCH - AFTER CEREMONY 157 ANGLE ON: the assembled military men -- in two lines, leading from the church door: GENERAL FEVERSHAM (CONT'D) (bellows) Draw... CLOSEUP: hands on hilts, as: GENERAL FEVERSHAM (bellows) Swooooords!!! TWO ROWS OF SWORDS ARE PULLED AND FLOURISHED -- INTO THE AIR! Sunlight glinting off the blades, the Officers and former Officers of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards form a canopy, beneath which... HARRY AND ETHNE: exit the church, arm-in-arm, to the CHEERS of their families and friends... and the bitter-sweet tears of Mrs. Adair. As they move down the steps, beneath the ceremonial swords... WITH AN ARMY BAND PLAYING A ROUSING MARCH... TRACK DOWN THE LINE TO REVEAL: the joyous faces of General Feversham, Colonel Sutch, Colonel Willoughby, and Captain Trench. As their heads turn to follow the lovers... CONTINUE TRACKING TO REVEAL: an EMPTY SPACE -- amidst the row of Officers, in honor of the missing Durrance. TRACK IN TOWARD THAT EMPTY SPACE, AND RACK BEYOND IT TO REVEAL: Harry and Ethne, kissing for real... at last. FREEZE FRAME. As the MILITARY MARCH PLAYS ON; CREDITS ROLL TO... THE END.

   OPEN ON: ICE.

   We're underwater looking up at it. A saw cuts through,
   heading right for us.


   EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS -- DUSK

   ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a
   frozen lake. They SING.

                   "The Frozen Heart (Ice Worker's Song)"

                            ICE HARVESTERS
                  BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR
                  AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING,
                  THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
                  HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.

   The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.
                  STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

                  SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER.
                  SPLIT THE ICE APART!
                  AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.
                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,
   share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the
   water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!
                  ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

   A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They
   fight it back.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  STRONGER THAN ONE, STRONGER THAN TEN
                  STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN!

   Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows.

                  CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.

   In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single
   block of ice out of the water.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

                  SPLIT THE ICE APART!
                  BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.

   The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
   pulls away.

   Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
   dinky little sled then head off.

   We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the
   sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the
   snowline...and descend upon...


   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.


   INT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT

   ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops
   up beside her.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

   Elsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                      (grumbling)
                  Anna, go back to sleep.

   Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.
                                                              3
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (drama queen-ish)
                  I just can't. The sky's awake, so
                  I'm awake, so we have to play.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  ...Go play by yourself.

   Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

   Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets
   an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's
   eyelids.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (mischievously)
                  Do you want to build a snowman?

   Elsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles.


   INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

   Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Come on, come on, come on, come on.

   Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited.


   INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT

   The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Do the magic! Do the magic!

   Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly
   burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.
   Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out
   and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching
   flakes in her palms and mouth.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  This is amazing!

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Watch this!

   Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
   suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna
   slides off, laughing.
                                                              4

   PLAY MONTAGE:

   -Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman
   together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                      (goofy voice)
                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

   Anna jumps up and hugs him.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  I love you, Olaf.

   -Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually
   propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.

   -The girls slide down snowbanks together!

   -Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.

                              YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Catch me!

   Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna.

                              YOUNG ELSA
                  Gotcha!

   Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (jumping faster)
                  Again! Again!

                             YOUNG ELSA
                      (struggling to keep up)
                  Slow down!

   Elsa suddenly slips.

   Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles
   down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

                              YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                  ANNA!

   Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of
   Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                  MAMA! PAPA!

   The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.
                                                                     5

   The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight
   of the room.

                            KING
                  Elsa, what have you done? This is
                  getting out of hand!

                            QUEEN
                      (seeing Anna)
                  Anna!

   The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.

                            ELSA
                  It was an accident. I'm sorry,
                  Anna.

                            QUEEN
                      (about Anna)
                  She's ice cold.

                            KING
                  ...I know where we have to go.

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:


   INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

   The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book
   inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles
   to a page with an ancient map.


   EXT. ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out
   of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a
   trail of ice behind them.


   EXT. FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST -- NIGHT

   A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark
   woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the
   girls, leaving the wake of ice.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Ice?

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:

   EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice.

                            YOUNG KRISTOFF
                  Faster, Sven!


   EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT

   Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They
   hide behind a rock and peek out.

   Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds
   the still unconscious Anna.

                            KING
                  Please, help. My daughter!

   Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward
   them. It looks as though they'll be crushed!

   But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then
   unfold, revealing bright faces.

                               YOUNG KRISTOFF
                  Trolls...?

   The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA.

                            BULDA
                  Shush. I'm trying to listen.

   She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them
   close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.

                            BULDA (CONT'D)
                  Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

   Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth.
   They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but
   determined. He nods respectfully to the king.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  Your Majesty.
                      (referring to Elsa)
                  Born with the powers or cursed?

                            KING
                  Born. And they're getting stronger.

   Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She
   does. He examines her.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                      (about Anna)
                  You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
                  The heart is not so easily changed,
                  but the head can be persuaded.

                            KING
                  Do what you must.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  I recommend we remove all magic,
                  even memories of magic to be
                  safe.... But don't worry, I'll
                  leave the fun.

   Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's
   head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand
   Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary
   memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their
   nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the
   girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in
   her head.

                            GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  She will be okay.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  But she won't remember I have
                  powers?

                            KING
                  It's for the best.

                             PABBIE
                  Listen to me, Elsa, your power will
                  only grow.

   As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a
   silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  There is beauty in your magic....
                  But also great danger.

   The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes.

                           PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  You must learn to control it.

   In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human
   figures to panic and attack Elsa.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  Fear will be your enemy.
                                                                     8

   Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King
   wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively.

                            KING
                  No. We'll protect her. She can
                  learn to control it. I'm sure.

   Over the King's words we...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

   -The Arendelle castle gates shutting.

                            KING (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Until then, we'll lock the gates.
                  We'll reduce the staff. We will
                  limit her contact with people and
                  keep her powers hidden from
                  everyone... including Anna.

   -The castle shutters close.

   -Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears.

   -Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new
   room. Anna watches, confused and sad.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


   INT. CASTLE WINDOW -- DAY

   We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the
   window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes
   down the hall.


   INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY

   Anna knocks on Elsa's door and SINGS.

                  I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY.

   -ELSA'S DOOR. Anna peeks through the key hole.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   -Anna calls through the keyhole.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN.

                            YOUNG ELSA (O.S.)
                  Go away, Anna.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (hearbroken)
                  ...OKAY BYE.

   -BEHIND THE DOOR -- DAY. Elsa sits at the window looking out,
   longingly. Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.

   -LATER. The King slips leather gloves onto Elsa's hands.

                            KING
                  The gloves will help.

   He pats her gloved hand.

                            KING (CONT'D)
                  See? You're good....
                      (starting their mantra)
                  Conceal it.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Don't feel it.

                            YOUNG ELSA & KING
                  Don't let it show.

   -INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY. Anna, now 9, knocks on
   Elsa's door.

                            ANNA (9)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   -INT. HALLWAY -- DAY. Alone, Anna rides a bicycle built for
   two in the hall by standing on the back seat.
                                                               10

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  OR RIDE OUR BIKE AROUND THE HALL?
                  I THINK SOME COMPANY IS OVERDUE...

   -INT. PORTRAIT ROOM -- DAY. Anna runs around the portrait
   room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  I'VE STARTED TALKING TO
                  THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS.

   Anna lands PLOP on the cushions, then looks up at the
   painting above her of the courageous Joan of Arc.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  Hang in there, Joan.

   -INT. EMPTY LIBRARY -- DAY. Looks like no one's around.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY
                  ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS.

   But then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather
   clock, playing with her braids, bored out of her mind.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY.

   Anna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- NIGHT. Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics.
   The entire wall is frozen behind her.

                            ELSA (12)
                  I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

                            KING
                  Getting upset only makes it worse.

   The King goes to hug her.

                            ELSA (12)
                  No. Don't touch me. I don't want to
                  hurt you.

   He and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness.

   -INT. LIBRARY -- DAY. Anna, now a teenager, slides past Elsa's
   room without stopping.
                                                                11

   -INT. KING AND QUEEN'S QUARTERS -- DAY. Anna runs into the
   room and throws herself into her parents' arms.

                            TEEN ANNA
                  See you in two weeks.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa curtsies in front of her
   parents, formally, not touching them.

                            TEEN ELSA
                  Do you have to go?

                            KING
                  You'll be fine, Elsa.

   -EXT. DOCKS -- DAY. The King and Queen leave on a ship.

   -EXT. ROUGH SEAS -- NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in
   a storm. The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves.

   -INT. CASTLE -- DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is
   covered in mourning cloth.

   -EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her
   people, beside burial stones.

   -INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR. Anna, still in her mourning
   clothes, approaches and knocks.

                            ANNA
                      (singing)
                  Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE

                  I'M RIGHT OUT HERE FOR YOU.
                  PLEASE LET ME IN.

   Anna slides down the door and sits with her head against it.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.
                  IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

                      (weak, internal)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   We move through the door...

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa is sitting in the exact same
   pose as Anna. Her bedroom is frozen with ice. Snowflakes hang
   in the air, suspended by grief.

                                                        FADE OUT.

   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- MORNING

   A new dawn rises over the fjords.

   Ships pull up to the docks. Guests pile out.

                            DOCK MASTER
                  Welcome to Arendelle!

   A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in
   his bunad jacket.

                            BOY
                  Why do I have to wear this?

                            MOTHER
                  Because the Queen has come of age.
                  It's Coronation Day!

                            BOY
                  That's not my fault.

   They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester
   chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and
   Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and
   nuzzles Kristoff's chest.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What do you want, Sven?

   Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  Give me a snack.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  What's the magic word?

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  Please!

   Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it
   to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Hey, hey, hey! Share!

   Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself,
   not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber.

   We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who
   rush towards the castle.
                                                              13

                            PERSI
                  I can't believe they're finally
                  opening up the gates!

                            AGGIE
                  And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!

   They pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his
   shoes to "enhance" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close
   behind him.

                            DUKE
                  Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious
                  trade partner. Open those gates so
                  I may unlock your secrets and
                  exploit your riches.
                      (catching himself)
                  ...Did I just say that out loud?

   We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle
   gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary.

                            IRISHMAN
                  Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see
                  the Queen and the Princess. I bet
                  they're absolutely lovely.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
                  I bet they are beautiful.

   We move past them, to a particular castle window.

                  Princess Anna...?

   Anna sits up. She's got major bedhead. She coughs. Snorts.
   Pulls a hair from her mouth.

                            ANNA
                  ...Huh? Yeah?

   She falls back asleep while sitting. She snores. Her head
   drops, startling her awake.

                  Who is it?

                            KAI (O.S.)

                            ANNA
                  My sister's cor-neration...

   One eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress.
   She bolts, wide awake in excitement.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Coronation Day! Ha ha!

   EXT. CASTLE HALL -- DAY

   Anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress.
   She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. Seeing the hustle
   and bustle of preparations, she can't help but SING.

                       "For the First Time in Forever"

                            ANNA

                  SO'S THAT DOOR!
                  I DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID THAT ANYMORE.
                  WHO KNEW WE OWNED 8000 SALAD PLATES...?

   -Anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  FOR YEARS I HAVE ROAMED THESE EMPTY HALLS

   evidence.

                  BUT WOW AM I SO READY FOR THIS CHANGE!

   -Anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washer's
   pulley. She raises herself up to see the ships arriving.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

                  I'LL BE DANCING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

   -Anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY,

                  'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

                  I can't wait to meet everyone....
                  (GASP) What if I meet THE ONE?

   -Anna twists herself in a velvet drape like it's a gown. She
   acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL-
                  FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL.
                  THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE.

   -She notices the bust of a man across the room.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (google-eyed)
                  I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE,

                  I WANNA STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY

                  BUT THEN WE LAUGH AND TALK ALL EVENING,
                  WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE.
                  NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR.

   The bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake.

   -Anna bursts into the portrait room, bounces on the
   furniture, and interacts with the paintings.
                                                               16

                  DON'T LET THEM IN.
                  DON'T LET THEM SEE.
                  BE THE GOOD GIRL
                  YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE.

   Elsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation. She
   takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a
   candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL.

                  MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE
                  AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

   The candlestick and ornament ice over. Elsa gasps, slams them
   back down onto the table. She tries to reassure herself.

                  BUT IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY.

   FOR THE FIRST TIME IN                  DON'T LET THEM IN
   FOREVER.                               DON'T LET THEM SEE

                ANNA                                   ELSA
   I'M GETTING WHAT I'M DREAMING          BE THE GOOD GIRL
   OF                                     YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

                ANNA                                   ELSA
   A CHANCE TO LEAVE MY SISTER'S          CONCEAL.
   WORLD                                  CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL.
   A CHANCE TO FIND TRUE LOVE             DON'T LET THEM KNOW.

   -Anna hurries over the bridge and into the village square.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I KNOW IT ALL ENDS TOMORROW,
                  SO IT HAS TO BE TODAY!!
                  `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
                  FOREVER. . .
                  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER!
                  NOTHING'S IN MY WAY!!!

   -Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE!

   She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off
   of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the
   horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.

                               ANNA (CONT'D)
                         (frustrated)
                  Hey!

                            HANS
                  I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

   The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal.

                            ANNA
                      (gentler)
                  Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.

                            HANS
                  Are you sure?

                            ANNA
                  Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I
                  was going. But I'm okay.

   He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I'm great, actually.

                            HANS
                  Oh, thank goodness.

   He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps
   her to her feet.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                      (bowing)
                  Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

                            ANNA
                      (curtseying)
                  Princess Anna of Arendelle.

                            HANS
                  Princess...? My Lady.

   He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too,
   curling his hoof up and out of the boat.

   The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.

                            ANNA
                  Hi...again.

   The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.
   Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.

                            HANS
                  Oh boy.

                            ANNA
                  Ha. This is awkward. Not you're
                  awkward, but just because we're--
                  I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.
                      (did she just say that?)
                  Wait, what?

   Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.

                            HANS
                  I'd like to formally apologize for
                  hitting the Princess of Arendelle
                  with my horse...and for every
                  moment after.

                            ANNA
                  No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT
                  Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my
                  sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash!
                  `Cuz, you know...
                      (patting the horse)
                  Hello.
                            (MORE)
                                                               19

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (to Hans)
                  But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

                              HANS
                  Just you?

   Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She
   doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's
   handsomeness.

                            ANNA
                  ...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I
                  better go. I have to...I better go.

   She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Bye!

   As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves
   too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.

                              HANS
                  Oh no.

   The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down
   in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.

                                                         CUT TO:

   INT. CHURCH CHAPEL -- DAY

   Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She
   peeks out to the audience.

   Hans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes.

   The crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are
   presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them.

                            BISHOP
                      (a whisper)
                  Your Majesty, the gloves.

   Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves,
   places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb
   and scepter, then turns to the people.

                            BISHOP (CONT'D)
                      (formal, in Old Norse)
                  Sehm hon HELL-drr IN-um HELL-gum
                  AYG-num ok krund ee THES-um HELL-
                  gah STAHTH, ehk teh frahm FUR-ear U-
                  thear...
                                                               20

   The scepter and orb start to freeze over.

                            BISHOP (CONT'D)
                  ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

                            CROWD
                  Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

   Just in time. Elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back
   down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice. She picks
   up her gloves and slips them on. She made it.

                                                        CUT TO:


   INT. GREAT HALL -- NIGHT

   Springy music fills the Great Hall. Guests dance. Eat. Laugh.

   TRUMPETS SOUND.

                            KAI
                      (announcing)
                  Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

   Elsa enters, poised and looking surprisingly content. She
   stands under a formal awning.

                            KAI (CONT'D)
                  Princess Anna of Arendelle!

   Anna runs into the room, waves awkwardly. Kai ushers her over
   to stand right next to Elsa.

                            ANNA
                  Here? Are you sure?

   She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other.

                            ELSA
                  ...Hi.

                            ANNA
                  Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

                            ELSA
                  ...You look beautiful.

                            ANNA
                  Thank you. You look beautifuller. I
                  mean, not fuller. You don't look
                  fuller, but more beautiful.
                                                            21
FROZEN - J. Lee



                               ELSA
                  Thank you.

   They look out at the celebration.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  So, this is what a party looks
                  like?

                            ANNA
                  It's warmer than I thought.

                            ELSA
                  And what is that amazing smell?

   They both close their eyes and inhale.

                            ANNA AND ELSA (TOGETHER)
                  ...Chocolate.

   Their eyes pop open. They laugh.

   Elsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She
   wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start.
   Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts.

                            KAI
                  Your Majesty. The Duke of
                  Weaseltown.

                            DUKE
                  Weselton. The Duke of Weselton.
                      (to Elsa)
                  Your Majesty, as your closest
                  partner in trade, it seems only
                  fitting that I offer you your first
                  dance as queen.

   The Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and
   a deep bow.

                            DUKE (CONT'D)
                      (whispers to himself)
                  One, two, three. Jump.

   As he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward.
   Anna giggles. Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself.

                            ELSA
                      (to the Duke)
                  Thank you...only I don't dance.
                                                               22

                            DUKE
                      (offended)
                  Oh...?

                            ELSA
                  But my sister does.

                            ANNA
                  What?

                            DUKE
                  Lucky you....

                            ANNA
                  Oh, I don't think--

   The Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can
   protest.

                             DUKE
                  If you swoon, let me know, I'll
                  catch you.

   Anna looks back at Elsa, desperately.

                            ELSA
                  Sorry.

   OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but he's just
   awful. Anna tries to make the best of it.

                            DUKE
                  Like an agile peacock... CLUCK-
                  CLUGGLE-CLUCK!

   He lands on her feet.

                            ANNA
                  Ow. Ow.

                            DUKE
                  Speaking of, so great to have the
                  gates open. Why did they shut them
                  in the first place? Do you know the
                  reason? Hmm?

   He gets in her face, suspicious.

                            ANNA
                  ...No.
                                                                   23
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            DUKE
                  Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't
                  call me the little dipper for
                  nothing.

   He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely
   hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks.

                            DUKE (CONT'D)
                      (groove fully on)
                  Like a chicken...with the face of a
                  monkey...I fly.

                                                        JUMP CUT TO:


   MOMENTS LATER...

   Anna limps back to Elsa.

                            DUKE (O.S.)
                  Let me know when you're ready for
                  another round, M'Lady.

                            ELSA
                  Well, he was sprightly.

                            ANNA
                      (rubbing her sore feet)
                  Especially for a man in heels.

                            ELSA
                  Are you okay?

                            ANNA
                      (loving Elsa's attention)
                  I've never been better. This is so
                  nice. I wish it could be like this
                  all the time.

                             ELSA
                      (sincere)
                  Me too....

   But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  But it can't.

                            ANNA
                  Why not? If--

                            ELSA
                  It just can't.
                                                                24

   Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional.

                            ANNA
                  Excuse me for a minute.

   She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened.

   Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's
   butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches
   her. He smiles perfectly.

                            HANS
                  Glad I caught you.

                               ANNA
                  Hans.

   He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts
   her up and leads her in a romantic dance.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

   LATER: Anna and Hans drink and chat.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I often had the whole parlor to
                  myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

   She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

   -THE CASTLE DOORS: Anna and Hans stroll out of the castle.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...Your physique helps I'm sure.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

   -THE ROSE GARDEN... Hans notices her white streak.

                            HANS
                      (about her white streak)
                  What's this?

                            ANNA
                  I was born with it, although I

   EXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT

   Anna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake.

                            ANNA
                  Yeah, the whole thing! You got it.

   They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face.

                            ANNA(CONT'D)
                  Okay wait, wait. So you have how
                  many brothers?

                            HANS
                  Twelve older brothers. Three of
                  them pretended I was invisible...
                  literally...for two years.

                            ANNA
                  That's horrible.

                            HANS
                  It's what brothers do.

                            ANNA
                  ...And sisters. Elsa and I were
                  really close when we were little.
                  But then, one day she just shut me
                  out, and I never knew why.

   He takes her hand. Leans in close.

                            HANS
                  I would never shut you out.

                            ANNA
                  Okay, can I just say something
                  crazy?

   They jump to the neighboring balcony and enter a door.

   They come out on top of one of the castle's towers.

   INT. BALL -- NIGHT

   Anna pushes through the crowd towards Elsa, Hans in tow.

                            ANNA
                  Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just
                  get around you there? Thank you.
                  Oh, there she is. Elsa!

   Elsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um.
                  May I present Prince Hans of the

                      (bowing)
                  Your Majesty.

   Elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey.

                            ANNA
                  We would like--

                  Well, we haven't worked out all the
                  details ourselves. We'll need a few
                  days to plan the ceremony. Of

                  Of course we have the room. I don't
                  know. Some of them must--

                            ELSA
                  Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers
                  are staying here. No one is getting
                  married.

                            ANNA
                  Wait, what?

                            ELSA
                  May I talk to you, please. Alone.

   Anna sees Hans's worried face. Hooks arms with him.

                            ANNA
                  No. Whatever you have to say, you-
                  you can say to both of us.

                            ELSA
                  Fine. You can't marry a man you
                  just met.

                            ANNA
                  You can if it's true love.

                            ELSA
                  Anna, what do you know about true
                  love?

                            ANNA
                  More than you. All you know is how
                  to shut people out.

                            ELSA
                  You asked for my blessing, but my
                  answer is no. Now, excuse me.

                  No, you may not. And I-I think you
                  should go.

   Elsa walks away. As she passes the Royal Handler--

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  The party is over. Close the gates.

                            ANNA
                  What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

   Anna grabs Elsa's hand. She pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa
   gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.

                            ELSA
                  Give me my glove!

   Anna holds the glove away from Elsa.

                      (desperate)
                  Elsa, please. Please. I can't live
                  like this anymore.

   Elsa fights tears.

                             ELSA
                      (weak)
                  ...Then leave.

   Elsa sees Anna's hurt face. It's too much. She can't hold it
   in. She turns and rushes away.

                            ANNA
                      (heartbroken)
                  ...What did I ever do to you?!

   The party goes silent as everyone watches the sisters.

                            ELSA
                  Enough, Anna.

                            ANNA
                  No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!
                  Why do you shut the world out?!
                  What are you so afraid of?!

                            ELSA
                  I said, enough!

   Ice shoots from Elsa's hand, spikes across the floor! Guests

   Elsa rushes out of the room.

                  Your Majesty? Are you all right?

   Elsa backs away from the baby. She knocks into the fountain,
   grabs its edge. The waters freeze at her touch.

   GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.

   The Duke and thugs come out the door.

                  There she is! Stop her!

                             ELSA
                      (to the Duke)
                  Please, just stay away from me.
                  Stay away!

   Magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the
   staircase into ice. The thugs and the Duke fall.

                            DUKE
                  Monster.... Monster!

   The crowd panics.

   A snowstorm begins. Elsa flees.

   Anna runs out of the palace doors, carrying the glove.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa!

   Hans follows closely behind her.

   GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to
   the water's edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet.

   Anna calls to her from the gates.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Elsa! Wait, please!

   Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively
   steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks
   into a run, as the water freezes over with each step.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Elsa, stop!

   Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls.

                            HANS
                  Anna!

   Hans rushes to Anna's side.

   Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just
   scrambles into the mountains.

                            ANNA
                  No.

                            HANS
                      (shocked)
                  Look.... The fjord.

   The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking
   the ships in place.


   INT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- NIGHT

   Snow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd.

                            CROWD WALLAH
                  Snow? It's...snow...in July.

                            HANS
                  ...Are you all right?

                              ANNA
                        (in shock)
                  No.

                            HANS
                  Did you know?

                              ANNA
                  No.

   Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright.

                            DUKE
                  Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!
                  The Queen has cursed this land! She
                  must be stopped!
                      (to his thugs)
                  You have to go after her.

   Anna rushes up to the Duke.

                              ANNA
                  Wait, no!

   The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna.

                            DUKE
                  You! Is there sorcery in you, too?
                  Are you a monster, too?

                            ANNA
                  No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

                            HANS
                  That's right she is...
                      (realizing how that
                       sounds)
                  ...in the best way.

                            ANNA
                  ...And my sister's not a monster.

                            DUKE
                  She nearly killed me.

                            HANS
                  You slipped on ice.

                            ANNA
                  It was an accident. She was scared.
                  She didn't mean it. She didn't mean
                  any of this.... Tonight was my
                  fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one
                  that needs to go after her.

                            DUKE
                  Yes. Fine. Do.

                            HANS
                  What?

                            ANNA
                      (to the Royal Handler)
                  Bring me my horse, please.

                            HANS
                  Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring
                  her back, and I'll make this right.

   The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak.

                            HANS
                  I'm coming with you.

                             ANNA
                  No, I need you here to take care of
                  Arendelle.

   He sees the desperation in her eyes.

                            HANS
                  ...On my honor.

   She throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse,
   coronation dress and all.

                            ANNA
                      (to the crowd)

                  hurt me.

   She snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her.

   The snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a
   blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves...


   EXT. HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   Well above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest
   peak. It's Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches
   her breath and sings...

                                "Let It Go"

                            ELSA
                  THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE
                  ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT,
                  NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN.
                  A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION
                  AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN.

                  THE WIND IS HOWLING
                  LIKE THIS SWIRLING STORM INSIDE.
                  COULDN'T KEEP IT IN,
                  HEAVEN KNOWS I TRIED. . .

                  DON'T LET THEM IN,
                  DON'T LET THEM SEE,
                  BE THE GOOD GIRL YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
                  BE.
                  CONCEAL,
                  DON'T FEEL,
                  DON'T LET THEM KNOW.
                  WELL, NOW THEY KNOW.

   Elsa takes off her glove and throws it into the air.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
                  CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE.

   Elsa creates a snowman, just like the one she made with Anna
   when they were children.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
                  TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR.
                  I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO
                  SAY.
                  LET THE STORM RAGE ON.
                  THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

   Elsa lets her cape fly back into the wind.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE
                  MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL.
                  AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME
                  CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL.
                  IT'S TIME TO SEE
                  WHAT I CAN DO,
                  TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH.
                  NO RIGHT, NO WRONG,
                  NO RULES FOR ME...I'M FREE!

   Elsa creates ice steps and climbs them.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
                  I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY.
                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
                  YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY.
                  HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.

   Elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET THE STORM RAGE ON....

   In a flurry of creative release, she raises the snowflake on
   ice beams, builds walls, archways, a glistening chandelier,
   and an intricate ceiling that leaves the sky visible.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR
                  INTO THE GROUND.
                  MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN
                  FRACTALS ALL AROUND.
                  AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE
                  AN ICY BLAST-

   Standing firmly in her mighty ice palace, Elsa removes her
   crown and throws it.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  I'M NEVER GOING BACK,
                  (back to resolve)
                  THE PAST IS IN THE PAST!

   She takes down her hair and creates a new dress made of ice.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
                  AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN.
                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

   The sun rises. Elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into
   the light. She's free.
                                                                  38

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  THAT PERFECT GIRL IS GONE.
                  HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.
                  LET THE STORM RAGE ON!!
                  THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

   She turns and slams her ice palace door on us.

                                                           CUT TO:


   EXT. THE FJORD FOREST -- DAY

   Anna rides her horse through two feet of snow. She shivers.

                  Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your

                  freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's
                  all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

   LATER: Anna and the horse struggle through a wooded area.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (hearing a wolf howl)
                  Of course, none of this would have
                  happened if she'd just told me her
                  secret...ha...she's a stinker.

   A branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. Anna
   goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. She sits up.
   Spits out snow. Sees the horse running away.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.
                  No. No. No.... Oooo-kay.

   He doesn't come back. Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning
   conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree
   snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


   EXT. MOUNTAIN -- NIGHT

   The Northern Lights shine as Anna struggles, out of breath,
   reaching the top of a hill.

                  Snow, it had to be snow, she
                  couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical
                  magic that covered the f-f-fjords
                  in white sand and warm --

   She sees smoke rising up in the distance.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Fire! WHOA!

   Anna goes tumbling down the hill. She lands with a crash in
   an icy stream at the bottom.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (from inside the snowball)
                  Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...


   EXT. A SMALL BUILDING AND STABLE -- NIGHT

   Anna shuffles up to the building, her dress frozen stiff. She
   shakes the snow off a sign and reads:

                            ANNA
                  Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

   Snow drops off a smaller sign. She reads it, happily.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Ooh! And Sauna...


   INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST & SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Anna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen
   butt and knocks her into the center of the shop. She looks
   around, sees only summer supplies.

                             OAKEN (O.S.)
                  Hoo hoo.

   Anna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind
   the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip.

                            OAKEN (CONT'D)
                  Big summer blow out. Half off
                  swimming suits, clogs, and a sun
                  balm of my own invention, yah?

                      (slight disappointment)
                  That would be in our winter
                  department.

   The winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a
   lonely pair of boots.

                            ANNA
                  Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has
                  another young woman, the Queen
                  perhaps, I don't know, passed
                  through here?

   She brings the clothes and boots to the counter.

                            OAKEN
                  Only one crazy enough to be out in
                  this storm is you, dear?

   The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a
   man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF.

                            OAKEN (CONT'D)
                  You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo.
                  Big summer blow out.

   Kristoff walks right up to Anna.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (in her face)
                  Carrots.

                            ANNA
                  Huh?

                            KRISTOFF
                  Behind you.

                            ANNA
                  Oh, right. Excuse me.

   Anna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of
   carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the
   place, gathering other supplies.

                            OAKEN
                      (to Kristoff)
                  A real howler in July, yah? Where
                  ever could it be coming from?

                      (to herself)
                  North Mountain.

   Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on
   his fingertips.

                            OAKEN
                  That'll be forty.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Forty? No, ten.

                            OAKEN
                      (sweet as pie)
                  Oh dear, that's no good. See these
                  are from our winter stock, where
                  supply and demand have a big
                  problem.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You want to talk about a supply and
                  demand problem? I sell ice for a
                  living.

   Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of
   ice on his sled, covered in snow.

                            ANNA
                  Ooh, that's a rough business to be
                  in right now. I mean, that is
                  really...
                      (he shoots her a look)
                  Ahem. That's unfortunate.

                            OAKEN
                  Still forty. But I will throw in a
                  visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!
                  Hi, family.

   Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through
   the window of the steaming sauna.

                             NAKED FAMILY
                  Hoo hoo!

                            KRISTOFF
                  ...Ten's all I got. Help me out.

                            OAKEN
                      (isolating the carrots)
                  Ten will get you this and no more.

   Kristoff seethes. Stalemate.
                                                               42
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            ANNA
                  Okay, just tell me one thing; what
                  was happening on the North
                  Mountain? Did it seem magical?

   Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Yes! Now, back up while I deal with
                  this crook here.

   Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.

                            OAKEN
                  What did you call me?


   EXT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!

   Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.

                             OAKEN
                  Bye bye.

   Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven,
   canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

   Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees
   something. He points to a dilapidated barn.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  But I did find us a place to sleep.
                  And it's free.


   INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he
   squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again.

                            OAKEN
                      (teddy bear)
                  I'm sorry about this violence. I
                  will add a quart of lutefisk, so
                  we'll have good feelings. Just the
                  outfit and boots, yah?
                                                                 43

   Anna looks between Kristoff's supplies and the door.

                                                           CUT TO:


   INT. OAKEN'S STABLES - NIGHT

   Kristoff, now unfrozen, relaxes on a bed of hay, playing his
   lute and singing to (and for) Sven.

                    "Reindeer(s) are Better than People"

                            KRISTOFF
                  REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE.
                  SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

                             KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                      (throwing his voice)
                  YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE
                  YOU & CHEAT YOU.
                  EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU.
                      (speaking)
                  Oh, thanks, Buddy.
                      (singing, as Kristoff)
                  BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN
                  REINDEERS.
                  SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?

                      (As Sven)
                  THAT'S ONCE AGAIN TRUE,
                  FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU.
                      (As Kristoff)
                  YOU GOT ME. LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.
                      (As Sven)
                  GOOD NIGHT.
                      (As Kristoff)
                  DON'T LET THE FROSTBITE BITE.

   The door opens. Anna enters.

                               ANNA
                  Nice duet.

   Kristoff sits up with a start...sees who it is.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Oh, it's just you. What do you
                  want?

                            ANNA
                  I want you to take me up the North
                  Mountain.
                                                                   44

                            KRISTOFF
                  I don't take people places.

   He lays back down, closes his eyes.

                            ANNA
                  Let me rephrase that...

   A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Umph.

   He sits up. Looks in the bag.

                            ANNA
                  Take me up the North Mountain....
                  Please.

   He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Look, I know how to stop this
                  winter.

   He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.

                            KRISTOFF
                  We leave at dawn.... And you forgot
                  the carrots for Sven.

   A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Ugh!

                            ANNA
                  Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I
                  didn't--
                      (catching herself)
                  We leave now. Right now.

   She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed,
   Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff
   has a bite, contemplating.

                                                        SLAM CUT TO:


   EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGH -- NIGHT

   Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled,
   which skids precariously. Kristoff mans the reins. Anna sits
   beside him.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (trying to scare Anna)
                  Hang on! We like to go fast!

                            ANNA
                      (fearless)
                  I like fast!

   Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.

   He pushes her feet down.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  This is fresh lacquer. Seriously,
                  were you raised in a barn?

   Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back
   and hits Anna in the face.

                            ANNA
                      (grossed out)
                  Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

   She wipes off her face.

                            KRISTOFF
                  So tell me, what made the Queen go
                  all ice-crazy?

                            ANNA
                  ...Oh well, it was all my fault. I
                  got engaged but then she freaked
                  out because I'd only just met him,
                  you know, that day. And she said
                  she wouldn't bless the marriage--

                            KRISTOFF
                  Wait. You got engaged to someone
                  you just met?

                            ANNA
                  Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she
                  got mad and then she tried to walk
                  away, and I grabbed her glove--

                            KRISTOFF
                  Hang on. You mean to tell me you
                  got engaged to someone you just
                  met?!

FROZEN - J. Lee



                            ANNA
                  Yes. Pay attention. But the thing
                  is she wore the gloves all the
                  time, so I just thought, maybe she
                  has a thing about dirt.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Didn't your parents ever warn you
                  about strangers?

   Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.

                            ANNA
                  Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a
                  stranger.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Oh yeah? What's his last name?

                            ANNA
                  ...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

                            KRISTOFF
                  What's his favorite food?

                            ANNA
                  ...Sandwiches.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Best friend's name?

                            ANNA
                  Probably John.

                               KRISTOFF
                  Eye color.

                               ANNA

                  Foot size...?

                            ANNA
                  Foot size doesn't matter.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Have you had a meal with him yet?
                  What if you hate the way he eats?
                  What if you hate the way he picks
                  his nose?

                  Picks his nose?

                            KRISTOFF
                  And eats it.

                            ANNA
                  Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.

                            KRISTOFF
                  All men do it.

                             ANNA
                  Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's
                  true love.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Doesn't sound like true love.

                            ANNA
                  Are you some sort of love expert?

                            KRISTOFF
                  No. But I have friends who are.

                            ANNA
                  You have friends who are love
                  experts.... I'm not buying it.

   Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (to Anna)
                  Stop talking.

                            ANNA
                  No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--

   Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.

                            KRISTOFF
                  I mean it. SHHH.

   Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
   Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its
   light reflects off...EYES. Several.

                            KRISTOFF(CONT'D)
                  Sven, go. Go!

   Sven takes off.

                            ANNA
                  What are they?

                            KRISTOFF
                  Wolves.

   Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into
   the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.

                            ANNA
                  Wolves. What do we do?

                            KRISTOFF
                  I've got this. You just...don't
                  fall off and don't get eaten.

                            ANNA
                  But I wanna help.

                             KRISTOFF
                  No.

                             ANNA
                  Why not?

                             KRISTOFF
                  Because I don't trust your
                  judgement.

                            ANNA
                  Excuse me?!

   A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Who marries a man she just met?

   Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.

                            ANNA
                  It's true love!

   He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a
   wolf away.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (shocked)
                  Whoa.

   Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf.
   The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.

                            ANNA
                  Christopher!

   Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the
   sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.

                            KRISTOFF
                  It's Kristoff!
                                                               49

   A wolf jumps on Kristoff's back.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  AH!

   Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.

                            ANNA
                  Duck!

   Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The
   blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You almost set me on fire!

   Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.

                            ANNA
                  But I didn't.

   Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Get ready to jump, Sven!

                            KRISTOFF
                  You don't tell him what to do!

   Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I do!

   Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness
   from the sled.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Jump, Sven!

   Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back.

   Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled.

   Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge.

   Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He
   leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air.

   He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his
   hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below
   and burst into flames.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (shocked sadness)
                  ...But I just paid it off.

   Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but
   it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Uh-oh. No, no, no.

   To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  AH! NO, NO, NO!

   The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
                  Grab on!

   Kristoff grabs on.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Pull, Sven! Pull!

   REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven.
   Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety.

   Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at
   the burning sled.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and
                  everything in it.

   Kristoff groans.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  And I understand if you don't want
                  to help me anymore.

   Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Of course I don't want to help her
                  anymore. In fact, this whole thing
                  has ruined me for helping anyone
                  ever again.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  But she'll die on her own.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)
                  I can live with that.
                                                                51

   Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong
   way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip...

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  But you won't get your new sled if
                  she's dead.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (knowing he's got a point)
                  ...You know sometimes I really
                  don't like you.

   Sven licks Kristoff happily.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)
                      (to Anna)
                  Hold up. We're coming?!

                      (excited)
                  You are?!
                      (catching herself)
                  I mean, sure. I'll let you tag
                  along.

   EXT. SHARP MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- DAWN

   Kristoff, Sven and Anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain.

   EXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST CLEARING -- DAY

   As they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of
   something far below.

                               ANNA
                  Arendelle.

                            KRISTOFF
                  It's completely frozen.

                            ANNA
                  ...But it'll be fine. Elsa will
                  thaw it.

                               KRISTOFF
                  Will she?

                      (uncertain)
                  ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to
                  the North Mountain?

   She points straight ahead.

                            KRISTOFF
                  More like this way.

   He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


   INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The
   hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks
   them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes.

                             ANNA
                  I never knew winter could be so
                  beautiful.

   Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that
   voice OLAF.

                            OLAF (O.S.)
                  YEAH...It really is beautiful,
                  isn't it? But it's so white. You
                  know, how about a little color?
                  Must we bleach the joy out of it
                  all? I'm thinking like maybe some
                  crimson, chartreuse...

   While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the
   source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually
   be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in
   branches, just as baffled as they are.

   In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind
   them.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  How `bout yellow--no, not yellow.
                  Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.

   He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him.
   How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Am I right?
                                                               53

   Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head,
   sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)
                        (cheery, to Kristoff)
                  Hi!

                            KRISTOFF
                  You're creepy.

   Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a
   game of hot potato.

                            ANNA
                  I don't want it!

                            KRISTOFF
                  Backatchya!

                            OLAF
                  Please don't drop me.

                              ANNA
                  Don't!

                            KRISTOFF
                  Come on, it's just a head.

                              ANNA
                  No!

   Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.

                            OLAF (O.S.)
                  All right, we got off to a bad
                  start.

                            ANNA
                  Ew, ew, the body!

   Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down. Olaf
   smiles happily, then looks confused.

                            OLAF
                  Wait, what am I looking at right
                  now? Why are you hanging off the
                  earth like a bat?

                            ANNA
                      (sympathetic)
                  ...Okay. Wait one second.

   Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head.
                                                               54

                            OLAF
                  Oooh! Thank you!

                            ANNA
                  You're welcome.

                            OLAF
                  Now I'm perfect.

   She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.

                            ANNA
                  Well, almost.

   She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as
   Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the
   way through his head.

                            OLAF
                  Woo! Head rush!

                            ANNA
                  Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was
                  just.... Are you okay?

   Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his
   eyes. He lights up.

                            OLAF
                  Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!
                  I've always wanted a nose.
                      (going cross-eyed to look
                       at his tiny nose)
                  So cute. It's like a little baby
                  unicorn.

   Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking
   out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  What? Hey! Whoa.
                      (seeing his now big nose)
                  Oh, I love it even more! Hah....
                  All right, let's start this thing
                  over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I
                  like warm hugs.

   Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It
   takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.

                            ANNA
                  Olaf?...That's right, Olaf.

                            OLAF
                  ...And you are?

                            ANNA
                  Oh, um...I'm Anna.

                            OLAF
                  And who's the funky-looking donkey
                  over there?

                            ANNA
                  That's Sven.

                            OLAF
                  Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

                               ANNA
                  ...Sven.

   Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused.

                            OLAF
                  Oh. They're--oh, okay....
                      (accepting it)
                  Makes things easier for me.

   Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss
                  my nose.
                      (gushes)
                  I like you, too!

                            ANNA
                  Olaf, did Elsa build you?

                               OLAF
                  Yeah. Why?

   Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies
   it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.

                            ANNA
                  Do you know where she is?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (studying the arm)
                  Fascinating...

                               OLAF
                  Yeah. Why?
                                                                   56

                  Do you think you could show us the
                  way?

                               OLAF
                  Yeah. Why?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (bending the arm)
                  How does this work?

   Olaf's dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.

                             OLAF
                  Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus
                  here.
                      (to Anna)
                  Yeah, why?

                            KRISTOFF
                  I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to
                  bring back summer.

                      (shocked)
                  Summer?
                      (sinking into wistfulness)
                  Oh, I don't know why but I've
                  always loved the idea of summer,
                  and sun, and all things hot.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Really? I'm guessing you don't have
                  much experience with heat.

                            OLAF
                  Nope. But sometimes I like to close
                  my eyes and imagine what it'd be
                  like when summer does come.

   OLAF'S FANTASY WORLD -- PERFECT SUMMER DAY

   Olaf walks through a grassy meadow with the sun shining
   behind him. He SINGS.

                                "In Summer"

                            OLAF

                  I'LL FINALLY SEE A SUMMER BREEZE /
                  BLOW AWAY A WINTER STORM /

   -Olaf floats in the water. All his pieces begin to separate.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO SOLID
                  WATER / WHEN IT GETS WARM.

   -Olaf tumbles on a sandy beach with sand-snowmen.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE / WHAT MY

   -Olaf and the seagull break out into a tap-dance.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  DA DA . . . DA DOO / AH BAH BAH BAH

   -Olaf and another snowman drink hot chocolate in a hot tub.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  THE HOT AND THE COLD ARE BOTH SO
                  INTENSE / PUT `EM TOGETHER, IT JUST
                  MAKES SENSE!

   -Olaf tap dances with a gaggle of seagulls.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  RATDADAT DAD DADA DOO . . .

   -Olaf bounds down a grassy hill.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  WINTER'S A GOOD TIME TO STAY IN AND

   He stops at a puddle, looks down at it. Smiles. Hops over it.
                                                                   58

                  HAPPY SNOWMAN!

   -Olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out. He
   relaxes and stares at the blue sky.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  WHEN LIFE GETS ROUGH I LIKE TO HOLD
                  ON TO MY DREAM / OF RELAXING IN THE
                  SUMMER SUN JUST LETTING OFF STEAM!

   Sven, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf have a picnic.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  OH THE SKY WILL BE BLUE / AND YOU

                  I'm gonna tell him.

                            ANNA
                  Don't you dare.

                               OLAF
                  IN SUMMER!

   Olaf sings the final note. We swing around him and return to:

   REALITY. He then straightens up and smiles.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's
                  go bring back summer!

   Olaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain.

                            ANNA
                      (laughing)
                  I'm coming!

   Sven hops along, happily following them. Kristoff watches all
   of them like they're nuts.

                  Somebody's got to tell him.

   EXT. ARENDELLE, VILLAGE -- DAY

   A layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around
   weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and
   guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile.

                            CITIZEN ONE
                  No. No. You've got the bark facing
                  down. The bark needs to be face-up.

                            CITIZEN TWO
                  Bark down is drier.

                               CITIZEN ONE
                  Bark up.

                               CITIZEN TWO
                  Bark down.

                               CITIZEN ONE
                  Bark up.

   Like a light in the dark, Hans moves through the crowd.

                            HANS
                  Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

                            GERDA
                  Arendelle is indebted to you, Your
                  Highness.

                            HANS
                  The castle is open. There's soup
                  and hot glögg in the Great Hall.

   He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  Here. Pass these out.

   Just then the Duke approaches Hans.

                            DUKE
                  Prince Hans, are we just expected
                  to sit here and freeze while you
                  give away all of Arendelle's
                  tradable goods?

                            HANS
                      (tall and confident)
                  Princess Anna has given her orders

                                                               60
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            DUKE
                  And that's another thing; has it
                  dawned on you that your princess
                  may be conspiring with a wicked
                  sorceress to destroy us all?

   Hans's nice eyes turn to threatening slits.

                            HANS
                  Do not question the Princess. She
                  left me in charge, and I will not
                  hesitate to protect Arendelle from
                  treason.

                            DUKE
                      (flabbergasted, offended)
                  Treason?!

   Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse. It
   returns alone, bucking and kicking. Hans grabs its reins.

                            HANS
                  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

                            CROWD
                      (various)
                  Princess Anna's horse. What
                  happened to her? Where is she?

   Hans steadies the horse, looks up at the mountain. He sees
   all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him.

                            HANS
                  ...Princess Anna is in trouble.
                      (calling out)
                  I need volunteers to go with me to
                  find her!

   Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush
   up to offer their services.

                            DUKE
                  I volunteer two men, my Lord!
                      (quietly to his thugs)
                  Be prepared for anything, and
                  should you encounter the Queen, you
                  are to put an end to this winter.

   His two thugs sneer.

   EXT. THE NORTH MOUNTAIN -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf move through hostile terrain.
   Wind-swept icicles face horizontal.

                            KRISTOFF
                  So how exactly are you planning to
                  stop this weather?

                      (confident)
                  Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

                            KRISTOFF
                  That's your plan? My ice business
                  is riding on you talking to your
                  sister.

                              ANNA
                  Yup.

   Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where
   he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He
   stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.

                            KRISTOFF
                  So you're not at all afraid of her?

                            ANNA
                  Why would I be?

                  Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest,
                  gentlest, warmest person ever.

   Olaf backs right into an icicle. It runs through his torso.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Oh, look at that. I've been
                  impaled.

   He laughs it off.

   Anna and Kristoff hit what looks like a dead end. The face of

   Kristoff looks around, sighs. Digs in his rucksack.

                            KRISTOFF
                  ...It's too steep. I've only got
                  one rope, and you don't know how to
                  climb mountains.

                              ANNA (O.S.)
                  Says who?

   Sven nudges Kristoff, who looks up to see Anna trying to
   climb the cliff's flat face.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (finding her ridiculous)
                  What are you doing?

                  You're going to kill yourself.

   Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I wouldn't put my foot there.

                            ANNA (O.S.)
                  You're distracting me.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Or there. How do you know Elsa even
                  wants to see you?

                            ANNA (O.S.)
                  I'm just blocking you out cause I
                  gotta concentrate here.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You know, most people who disappear
                  into the mountains want to be
                  alone.

                            ANNA (O.S.)
                  Nobody wants to be alone. Except
                  maybe you--

   Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold.

                  Yes, the love experts!

   Anna realizes she's stuck.

                            ANNA
                  ...Please tell me I'm almost there.

   REVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...Does the air seem a bit thin to
                  you up here?

   Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her.

                             KRISTOFF
                  Hang on.

   He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from
   behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.

                            OLAF
                  Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is
                  going to solve the problem, but I
                  found a staircase that leads
                  exactly where you want it to go.

                            ANNA
                  Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

   Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Thanks! That was like a crazy trust
                  exercise.

   She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off.
   Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck.


   EXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace.

                            ANNA
                  Go ahead. I won't judge.

   Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His
   hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction.
   Kristoff runs to his aide.

                            KRISTOFF
                  All right, take it easy. I gotcha.

   Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  You stay right here, buddy.

   Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his
   tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  ...Flawless.

   Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates.

                            OLAF
                  ...Knock....
                      (she doesn't)
                  Just knock....
                      (she doesn't. To Kristoff)
                  Why isn't she knocking...? Do you
                  think she knows how to knock?

   Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors
   slide open.

                            ANNA
                  Ha. It opened. That's a first.

   Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought,
   stops him.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  You should probably wait out here.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What?

                            ANNA
                  Last time I introduced her to a
                  guy, she froze everything.

                            KRISTOFF
                  But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice
                  is my life.

                               OLAF
                  Bye, Sven.

   Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him.

                            ANNA
                  You too, Olaf.

                               OLAF
                  Me?

                            ANNA
                  Just give us a minute.

                               OLAF
                  Okay.

   As Anna walks inside. Olaf starts counting.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  One...two...

   Kristoff joins in.

                            OLAF AND KRISTOFF
                  Three...four...


   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   Anna walks into a great foyer. The place is beautiful, but
   also eerie.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa? It's me...Anna?!

   Anna slips. Steadies herself.

                               ELSA (O.S.)
                  Anna.

   Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony. She sees Anna,
   looks to her longingly.

   Anna can't help but be struck by Elsa's beauty.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa, you look different.... It's a
                  good different.... And this place
                  is amazing.
                                                            66

                            ELSA
                      (cautious, polite)
                  Thank you, I never knew what I was
                  capable of.

   Anna starts to climb the stairs.

                            ANNA
                  ...I'm so sorry about what
                  happened. If I'd known--

   Elsa backs up, away from Anna.

                            ELSA
                      (on guard)
                  No, it's okay. You don't have to
                  apologize.... But you should
                  probably go, please.

                            ANNA
                  But I just got here.

                            ELSA
                  ...You belong in Arendelle.

                               ANNA
                  So do you.

   Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more.

                            ELSA
                  No, I belong here. Alone. Where I
                  can be who I am without hurting
                  anybody.

                            ANNA
                  ...Actually, about that--

                            OLAF (O.S.)
                  58...59...60.

                            ELSA
                  Wait. What is that?

   Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves.

                            OLAF
                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

                            ELSA
                      (shocked)
                  Olaf?

   Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated.
                                                                   67
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            OLAF
                      (bashful)
                  You built me. You remember that?

                            ELSA
                      (astonished)
                  And you're alive?

                            OLAF
                  Um...I think so?

   Anna kneels down beside Olaf.

                            ANNA
                  He's just like the one we built as
                  kids.... We were so close. We can
                  be like that again.

   Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her.

                                                       FLASH CUT TO:

   FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by Elsa's powers.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Anna!

   Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her.

                                                       FLASH CUT TO:

   THE PRESENT: Elsa's face sinks in pain.

                            ELSA
                  No, we can't.

   Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  Goodbye, Anna.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa, wait--

                            ELSA
                      (calling back)
                  I'm just trying to protect you.

   Elsa continues to flee. Anna pursues.

                             ANNA
                  You don't have to protect me. I'm
                  not afraid. Please don't shut me
                  out again.

   Anna SINGS.

                      "First Time in Forever, Reprise"

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR.
                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR
                  DISTANCE ANYMORE.

                  `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
                  FOREVER,
                  I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.
                  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
                  WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND.
                  WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN
                  TOGETHER.
                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR.
                  `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
                  FOREVER,
                  I WILL BE RIGHT HERE.

   They arrive on the top floor, Elsa's main living space. Elsa
   turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined.

                            ELSA
                  Anna,
                  PLEASE GO BACK HOME.
                  YOUR LIFE AWAITS.
                  GO ENJOY THE SUN
                  AND OPEN UP THE GATES.

                            ANNA
                  Yeah, but--

                            ELSA
                  I know!
                  YOU MEAN WELL,
                  BUT LEAVE ME BE.
                  YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND
                  FREE.

   Elsa opens up the balcony doors.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE
                  FROM ME.

                            ANNA
                  ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT.

                            ELSA
                  WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT?

                            ANNA
                  I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?

                            ELSA
                  WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?

                            ANNA
                  ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP
                  SNOW.

                            ELSA
                  What?

   Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains.

                            ANNA
                  You kind of set off an eternal
                  winter...everywhere.

                            ELSA
                  Everywhere?

                            ANNA
                  It's okay, you can just unfreeze
                  it.

                            ELSA
                  No, I can't. I don't know how.

                            ANNA
                  Sure you can. I know you can.

   Snow starts to swirl around the room.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

                            ELSA
                      (panicking)
                  I'M SUCH A FOOL!
                  I CAN'T BE FREE!

                            ANNA
                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

                            ELSA
                  NO ESCAPE
                  FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME!

   The snow picks up. Anna tries to fight through it.

                            ANNA
                  WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER.
                                                               70

                            ELSA
                  I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE!

                            ANNA
                  WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE
                  MADE.

                            ELSA
                  ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT
                  WORSE!

                            ANNA
                  DON'T PANIC.

                            ELSA
                  THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR!

                            ANNA
                  WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.

                            ELSA
                  YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!

                            ANNA
                  WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...

   But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening
   blizzard taking over the room.

                             ELSA
                  NO!

                            ANNA (O.S.)
                  WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER,
                  AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...

   Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.

                             ELSA
                  I CAN'T!

   Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and
   then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.

   Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in
   pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees.

   Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff
   rush into the room to Anna's side.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna. Are you okay?
                                                                   71

                            ANNA
                  I'm okay.... I'm fine.

   Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.

                            ELSA
                      (scared)
                  Who's this? Wait, it doesn't
                  matter. You have to go.

                             ANNA
                  No, I know we can figure this out
                  together--

                            ELSA
                      (desperate)
                  How? What power do you have to stop
                  this winter? To stop me?

   Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows
   creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna, I think we should go.

                            ANNA
                      (close to tears)
                  No. I'm not leaving without you,
                  Elsa.

                            ELSA
                      (heartbroken but decisive)
                  Yes, you are.

   Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman.
   We'll call him MARSHMALLOW.

                                                        SLAM CUT TO:


   EXT. ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their
   necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.

                            ANNA
                  Stop. Put us down!

                            OLAF
                      (to Marshmallow)
                  You are a lot stronger than I think
                  you realize.

   Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps.
                                                                    72
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            MARSHMALLOW
                      (like a bouncer)
                  Go away!

   Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, who's got his tongue stuck
   to the ice railing.

                              OLAF (O.S.)
                  Heads up!

   Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.

                              ANNA
                  Olaf!

                            OLAF
                  Watch out for my butt!

   Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the
   snowbank.

   Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle.

   Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.

                            ANNA
                  It is not nice to throw people!

   Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.

              KRISTOFF                                   ANNA
   All right feisty pants. Calm             Let me at him. I want to get
   down. Woaw. Just let the snow            him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm.
   man be.

   Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and
   throws it at Marshmallow.

   The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even
   the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He
   ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!

                            OLAF
                  ...I'll distract him. You guys go.

   Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite
   direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  No, no, not you guys.

   Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's
   head falls and lands face down in snow.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                      (muffled)
                  This just got a whole lot harder.

   Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They
   tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard
   right behind them.

   They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under
   the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.

                               KRISTOFF
                  This way!

   Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of
   the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (impressed)
                  Ho-ho-ho!

                               ANNA
                  I got him!

   Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost
   run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Whoa, stop!

                            ANNA
                  It's a hundred foot drop.

                            KRISTOFF
                  It's two hundred.

   Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.

                               ANNA
                  Ow.

   He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the
   snow with a pick axe.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  What's that for?

                            KRISTOFF
                  I'm digging a snow anchor.

                            ANNA
                      (not trusting)
                  Okay. What if we fall?

                            KRISTOFF
                  There's twenty feet of fresh powder
                  down there; it'll be like landing
                  on a pillow.... Hopefully.

   They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Okay, Anna. On three.

   Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.

                            ANNA
                  Okay. You tell me when...

                               KRISTOFF
                  One...

                            ANNA
                  ...I'm ready to go....

                               KRISTOFF
                  Two...

                            ANNA
                      (pumped up)
                  ...I was BORN ready! Yes!

                               KRISTOFF
                  Calm down.

   A huge tree flies through the air toward them.

                               ANNA (O.S.)
                  TREE!

   Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They
   hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches
   their fall.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Whoa! That happened.

   Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete
   mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs
   and puffs, struggling to run.

                            OLAF
                  Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.
                                                               75

   He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!
                  Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost
                  Marshmallow back there!

   Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                      (happily)
                  Hey. We were just talking about
                  you. All good things, all good
                  things.

   Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)
                  NO!

   Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not
   making much of a difference.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  This is not making much of a
                  difference!

   Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)
                  WHOA!

   Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.

                              ANNA
                  Olaf!

                            OLAF
                  Hang in there, guys!

   Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.

                            ANNA
                  Wait, what?

   Kristoff's head hits the cliff.

                              KRISTOFF
                  Aargghh!

   Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.

                              ANNA
                  Kristoff!
                                                               76

   Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all
   over them.

                            MARSHMALLOW
                  Don't come back!

                            ANNA
                      (grossed out by his snow
                       breath)
                  Ugh. We won't.

   Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to
   just as they fall. They both SCREAM!

   SLAM!

   REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her
   shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Hey, you were right. Just like a
                  pillow.

   She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's
   boots, which are sticking out of the snow.

                            OLAF
                      (shaking the boots)
                  I can't feel my legs! I can't feel
                  my legs!

   Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up. He spits out snow.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Those are my legs.

   Olaf's bottom goes running by.

                            OLAF
                      (to Kristoff)
                  Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my
                  butt.

   Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Oh, that feels better.

   Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose.

                               OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Hey, Sven!

   Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off
   his nose -- and misses.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  He found us.
                      (to Sven, funny voice)
                  Who's my cute little reindeer?

                            KRISTOFF
                  Don't talk to him like that.

   Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.

                               KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Here.

   He lifts her out easily.

                            ANNA
                      (impressed)
                  Whoa!

                               KRISTOFF
                  You okay?

                               ANNA
                  Thank you.

   They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...Um.... How's your head?

   She touches the spot where he banged his head.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (in pain)
                  Ah! Ooh!

   He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good.
                  Ha. I've got a thick skull.

                            OLAF
                  I don't have a skull.... Or bones.

                               KRISTOFF
                  ...So....

   The awkwardness is killing him.

                              KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (shy)
                  Now what?

                             ANNA
                      (shy)
                  Now what?
                      (then...panicking)
                  Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do?
                  She threw me out. I can't go back
                  to Arendelle with the weather like
                  this. And then there's your ice
                  business--

                            KRISTOFF
                  Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice
                  business...
                      (noticing something)
                  Worry about your hair?!

   She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.

                            ANNA
                  What? I just fell off a cliff. You
                  should see your hair.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No, yours is turning white.

   She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white.

                            ANNA
                  White? It's what?

                            KRISTOFF
                  It's because she struck you; isn't
                  it?

                            ANNA
                  Does it look bad?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (thinking)
                  ...No.

   Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to
   join the conversation.

                            OLAF
                  You hesitated.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No, I didn't. Anna, you need help.
                  Now, come on.
                                                                  79

   He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow.

                            OLAF
                  Okay! Where are we going?

                            KRISTOFF
                  To see my friends.

                            ANNA
                      (catching up)
                  The love experts?

                            OLAF
                  Love experts?!

                            KRISTOFF
                  Yes. And don't worry; they'll be
                  able to fix this.

                            ANNA
                  How do you know?

   He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls
   heal her as a child.

                            KRISTOFF
                  ...Because I've seen them do it
                  before.

   As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven.

                            OLAF
                  I like to consider myself a love
                  expert.

   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself.

                            ELSA
                      (mantra-style)

   She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a
   sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow
   up the wall, taking over the castle.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as
   he rides on Sven's back.

                            OLAF
                  Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

   Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Are you cold?

                            ANNA
                  ...A little.

   He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides
   against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do,
   then gets a thought.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Wait. Come here.

   He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock-
   lined pass.

   Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path.
   He holds her hands over one of them.

                            ANNA
                  Oooh.... That's nice.

   They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (taking a deep breath)
                  So, about my friends...well, I say
                  friends, they're more like
                  family.... Anyway, when I was a
                  kid, it was just me and
                  Sven...until they took me in.

                            ANNA
                      (moved)
                  They did?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (nervous ramble)
                  Yeah. I don't want to scare you,
                  they can be a little bit
                  inappropriate...and loud...very
                  loud...they're also stubborn at
                  times, and a little overbearing.
                  And heavy. Really, really heavy.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  But they're fine.. You'll get it.
                  They mean well.

   Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly.

                            ANNA
                  Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

   Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Okay then....

   Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave
   of the arms announces--

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Meet my family.

   REVEAL: he's surrounded by rocks.

                             KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (to the rocks)
                  Hey, guys!

   As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and
   greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.

                            ANNA
                      (to herself)
                  ...They're rocks.

                            OLAF
                      (realizing)
                  He's crazy.
                      (covertly, to Anna)
                  I'll distract them while you run.
                      (Loud and slow to a rock)
                  Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to
                  meet you!
                      (quietly to Anna)
                  Anna, because I love you, I insist
                  you run.
                      (to the rock)
                  I understand you're love experts!
                      (to Anna)
                  Why aren't you running?

   Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away.

                            ANNA
                  Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--

   Just then the rocks around her start rolling.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (panicking)
                  Kristoff!

   Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff
   and unfold as trolls.

                            BULDA
                  KRISTOFF'S HOME!

                            TROLLS (VARIOUS)
                  Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's
                  been too long! Kristoff's home!

   Olaf jumps around all excitedly.

                            OLAF
                      (excitedly)
                  Kristoff's home.

   He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Wait? Kristoff?

   Anna watches, shocked and confused.

   The trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him
   down with a boulder's strength.

                            TROLL ONE
                  Oh, lemme look at you!

   Another troll tries to pull off his clothes.

                            TROLL TWO
                  Oh, take off your clothes,
                  Kristoff; I wash them.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (holding up his pants)
                  Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes
                  on, thank you.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Great to see you all. Where's
                  grandpa?

                            MUSHROOM KID TROLL
                  He's napping. But look, I grew a
                  mushroom.

                            TROLL SCOUT KID
                  And I earned my fire crystal.

                            KIDNEY STONE TROLL
                  I passed a kidney stone.

                            PICK ME UP TROLL
                  Pick me up.

   The kid troll jumps up on Kristoff's arm. Kristoff sinks
   under the weight of him.

   Anna still stares, confused, then realizes...

                            ANNA
                  Trolls? They're trolls.

   Silence. All troll eyes turn to Anna. Blink. Blink.

                            BULDA
                  ...He's brought a girl!

                            TROLLS (TOGETHER)
                  He's brought a girl!

   Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls. They body-surf/roll
   Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms.

                            ANNA
                  What's going on?

                            KRISTOFF
                  I've learned to just roll with it.

   Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look
   at Anna. She studies her like she's a piece of cattle.

                            BULDA
                  Let me see. Bright eyes. Working
                  nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes.
                  She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

                            ANNA
                  Wait. Oh. Um. No.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You've got the wrong idea. That's
                  not why I brought her here.

                            ANNA
                  Right. We're not. I'm not--

   Anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.

   Kristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly
   beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals.

                            ALL TROLLS

   By this time Kristoff and Anna are being ushered into a pit
   by the sheer force of numbers.

                  TRUE
                  TRUE
                  LOVE

   During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each
   other differently. Hmmm. Maybe those trolls are right?
   Sparks! Chemistry!

                            TROLL PRIEST
                  Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be
                  your trollfully wedded--

                            ANNA
                  Wait, what?!

                            TROLL PRIEST

                            TROLLS
                  LOVE!

   Just then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. She's
   shivering something fierce.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna?

   He pulls off her cape and hat.

                  She's as cold as ice.

   Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd.
   Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the
   pit.

                            GRAND PABBIE

                  Anna, your life is in danger. There

                  What...? No.

                            KRISTOFF
                  So remove it, Grand Pabbie.

                  I can't. If it was her head, that
                  would be easy. But only an act of
                  true love can thaw a frozen heart.

                            ANNA
                  An act of true love?

   Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms. More of
   her hair turns white.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna, we've got to get you back to
                  Hans.

                            ANNA
                      (still weak)
                  ...Hans.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Help us out, Sven.

   Kristoff grabs Sven's antlers. Sven pulls them out.

   Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Come on, Olaf!

   Sven takes off. Olaf grabs Sven's tail, rides with them.

                            OLAF
                  I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who
                  is this Hans?!

   EXT.    ELSA'S PALACE - DAWN

   Hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle.

                            HANS
                  We are here to find Princess Anna.
                  Be on guard, but no harm is to come
                  to the Queen. Do you understand?

   The Duke's thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow
   rises from the ground behind Hans. It's Marshmallow, Elsa's
   snow guard.

                               MARSHMALLOW
                  Go away!

   He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of
   the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow,
   who quickly knocks them over.

   Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple
   over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but
   Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword,
   leaps, and grabs it.

   Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors.

   The Duke's two thugs see her.

                               DUKE'S THUG
                  The Queen.

   The thugs charge up the stairs.

   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   They guards burst through the ice doors.

   Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue.

   They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.

                            ELSA
                      (scared)
                  No. Please.

   One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last
   moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches
   from her face.

   The thugs reposition to take another shot.

                               ELSA (CONT'D)
                  Stay away!

   Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and
   continue the attack.

                            THUG
                  Get her! Get her!

   Elsa fights for her life.

   BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls
   away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices
   Marshmallow's leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles
   back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not
   before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge.

   REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and
   they rush into the ice palace.


   INT. ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Elsa is surrounded. It's do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa
   traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.

   The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against
   the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK.

   OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug
   is pushed to the edge. He's inches away from falling to his
   death.

   BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and
   the thugs near death.
                                                                   90

                            HANS
                  Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster
                  they fear you are.

   Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened,
   moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans,
   overwhelmed, frightened.

   The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice
   spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage
   and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back.

   Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the
   arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging
   directly above Elsa.

   The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN.

   Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast.

   All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the
   sound of it shattering as it rings out.

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.


   FADE IN ON:

   Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open.

   She sits up. She's surrounded by stone.


   INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON -- DAY

   Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's
   pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves.
   She's chained to the wall.

   Elsa strains to looks out a window...

   INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting
   further buried under the ice and snow that is falling.

                            ELSA
                  No....What have I done?

   Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  Why did you bring me here?

                            HANS
                  I couldn't just let them kill you.
                                                              91

                            ELSA
                  But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get
                  Anna.

                            HANS
                  Anna has not returned....

   Elsa looks to the storm with worry.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  If you would just stop the winter,
                  bring back summer...please.

   Elsa meets his eyes, desperate.

                            ELSA
                  Don't you see...I can't.

   Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  You have to tell them to let me go.

   Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.

                            HANS
                  I will do what I can.

   He opens the door and leaves.

   Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her
   shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up.

                                                        CUT TO:


   EXT. THE FJORDS -- DAY

   Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his
   back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style.

   Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms. She's weakening. Kristoff
   takes off his hat and puts it on her head.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Just hang in there.
                      (to Sven)
                  Come on, buddy, faster!

   They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them,
   out of control.

                            OLAF
                  I'll meet you guys at the castle!

                            OLAF
                  I will!

   He disappears into the village streets.

                            OLAF (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Hello!

                            GUARD
                  It's Princess Anna!

   Sven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off,
   holding Anna, and carries her to the gate.

                            KRISTOFF
                  I've got you.

   Anna looks up at him, gratefully.

                            ANNA
                  ...Are you g-gonna be okay?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (touched, reassuring)
                  Don't worry about me.

   Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid
   rush to help Anna.

                            GERDA
                  Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.

                            KAI
                  My Lady. You are freezing.

                            GERDA
                  You poor girl, you're freezing.
                  Let's get you inside.

                            KAI
                  We will. Thank you.

   Anna is swept away from Kristoff and into the palace grounds.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Make sure she's safe!

   Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him.

   Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with
   worry at the closed gates.

   Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly
   follows.

                                                        CUT TO:


   INT. LIBRARY -- DAY

   Hans stands with the dignitaries and guards.

                            HANS
                  I'm going back out to look for
                  Princess Anna.

                            FRENCH DIGNITARY
                  You cannot risk going out there
                  again.

                            HANS
                  If anything happens to her--

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
                  If anything happens to the
                  Princess, you are all Arendelle has
                  left.

   Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to
   depend on him. Is he really all they have left?

   Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna.

                            KAI
                  He's in here. Prince Hans.

   Hans rushes to Anna. She falls into his arms.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  You're so cold.

                            ANNA
                      (weak, but desperate)
                  Hans, you have to kiss me.

                            HANS
                  What?

                            ANNA
                  Now. Here we go.

   She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in
   his arms.

                            GERDA
                  We'll give you two some privacy.

   Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.

                            HANS
                  What happened out there?

                            ANNA
                  Elsa struck me with her powers.

                            HANS
                  You said she'd never hurt you.

                            ANNA
                  I was wrong.

   Anna crumbles, weak.

                            HANS
                  Anna.

   Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.

                            ANNA
                      (shivering more)
                  She froze my heart and only an act
                  of true love can save me.

                            HANS
                      (understanding)
                  A true love's kiss.

   He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile.
   He leans in slowly...gently...

   Then he stops.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  Oh, Anna. If only there was someone
                  out there who loved you.

                            ANNA
                  What?

   Hans gets up, leaving her there.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...You said you did.

   He goes to the window and shuts the curtains.

                            HANS
                  As thirteenth in line in my own
                  kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I
                  knew I'd have to marry into the
                  throne somewhere--

                            ANNA
                  What are you talking about?

                            HANS
                      (putting out the candles)
                  As heir, Elsa was preferable, of
                  course. But no one was getting
                  anywhere with her. But you-

                            ANNA
                  Hans?

                            HANS
                  You were so desperate for love you
                  were willing to marry me, just like
                  that.

   Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table
   and goes to the fireplace.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  I figured, after we married, I'd
                  have to stage a little accident for
                  Elsa.

   Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire.
   Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak.

                            ANNA
                  Hans. No, stop.

                            HANS
                  But then she doomed herself, and
                  you were dumb enough to go after
                  her.

                            ANNA
                  Please.

                            HANS
                      (chuckles)
                  All that's left now is to kill Elsa
                  and bring back summer.

   Hans approaches Anna.

                            ANNA
                  ...You're no match for Elsa.

   He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time
   not so gently.

                            HANS
                  No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on
                  the other hand, am the hero who is
                  going to save Arendelle from
                  destruction.

   She wrenches her face out of his hands.

                            ANNA
                      (anger)
                  You won't get away with this.

   Hans rises and crosses to the door.

                            HANS
                  Oh, I already have.

   Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna
   struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.

                            ANNA
                      (hoarse and weak)
                  Please, somebody help.

   The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the

   INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- NIGHT

   The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He
   rubs his arms and shivers.

                            DUKE
                  It's getting colder by the minute.
                  If we don't do something soon,
                  we'll all freeze to death.

   Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
                  Prince Hans.

                            HANS
                  Princess Anna is...dead.

                            VARIOUS DIGNITARIES
                  What...? No.... Mon dieu.

   Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair.

                            DUKE
                  What happened to her?

                            HANS
                  She was killed by Queen Elsa.

                            DUKE
                  Her own sister.

                            HANS
                      (really putting it on)
                  At least we got to say our marriage
                  vows...before she died in my arms.

   He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.

                            DUKE
                  There can be no doubt now; Queen
                  Elsa is a monster and we are all in
                  grave danger.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
                  Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to
                  you.

   Hans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do
   it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas.
                                                               98

                            HANS
                  With a heavy heart, I charge Queen
                  Elsa of Arendelle with treason and
                  sentence her to death.


   INT. ELSA'S DUNGEON -- DAY

   The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is
   devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.

                            GUARD (O.S.)
                  She's dangerous. Move quickly and
                  with resolve.

   Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door
   busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men
   duck out of the way.

   Hans pushes his way into the room...sees...

   The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the
   floor. Elsa is gone.


                                                       CUT TO:


   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE -- DAY

   Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not
   wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes
   his head. Enough.

   He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts
   and grunts.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What is it, buddy?

   Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Hey, watch it. What's wrong with
                  you?

   Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (avoiding)
                  ...I don't understand you when you
                  talk like that.
                                                              99
FROZEN - J. Lee



   Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to
   lift Kristoff off the ground.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

   Sven drops him hard then "yells" at him once more.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  No, Sven! We're not going back!

   Sven shakes his head, angrily.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  She's with her true love.

   Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face. Kristoff gets it;
   he's made his point.

   Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the
   kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the
   castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Anna.

   Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven
   runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and
   jumps onto his back.

                                                        CUT TO:


   INT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT

   Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking
   the ceiling.

   The door handle suddenly jiggles. Stops. Jiggles again.

                            ANNA
                      (barely a whisper)
                  Help.

   CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and
   hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back
   on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.

                            OLAF
                  Anna. Oh no.

   He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood,
   including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues,
   before striking a match and relighting the fire.

                            ANNA
                  Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

                             OLAF
                  Whoa! So this is heat....
                      (considering)
                  I love it.

   He reaches a twig finger toward the flames. It catches on
   fire.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Ooh! But don't touch it!

   He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to
   the fire.

                             OLAF (CONT'D)
                  So, where's Hans? What happened to
                  your kiss?

                             ANNA
                  I was wrong about him. It wasn't
                  true love.

                            OLAF
                      (confused innocence)
                  Huh. But we ran all the way here?

                            ANNA
                  Please Olaf, you can't stay here;
                  you'll melt.

                            OLAF
                  I am not leaving here until we find
                  some other act of true love to save
                  you.

   He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against
   hers and thinks.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  ...Do you happen to have any ideas?

                            ANNA
                  I don't even know what love is.

                            OLAF
                      (confident)
                  That's okay, I do....

   Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Love is...putting someone else's
                  needs before yours, like, you know,
                  how Kristoff brought you back here
                  to Hans and left you forever.

                            ANNA
                  ...Kristoff loves me?

                            OLAF
                  Wow, you really don't know anything
                  about love, do you?

   His face starts to melt.

                            ANNA
                  Olaf, you're melting.

                            OLAF
                      (sweet and reassuring)
                  Some people are worth melting for.

   But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow
   back in place.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Just maybe not right this second.

   Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Don't worry, I've got it!

   Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut
   but struggles with the second panel.

                             OLAF (CONT'D)
                      (determined)
                  We're going to get through--
                      (distracted)
                  Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting
                  something.

   He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope
   and sees...

   Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  It's Kristoff and Sven! They're
                  coming back this way.

                            ANNA
                  ...They-they are?

                            OLAF
                  Wow, he's really moving fast.
                  Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I
                  guess Kristoff doesn't love you
                  enough to leave you behind.

   Anna tries to get to her feet.

                            ANNA
                  Help me up, Olaf. Please.

   He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the
   chess set and water jugs.

                            OLAF
                  No, no, no, no, no. You need to
                  stay by the fire and keep warm.

                            ANNA
                  I need to get to Kristoff.

                            OLAF
                      (clueless)
                  Why...?
                      (realizing)
                  Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

   He hops around in an excited display of hope.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  There's your act of true love,
                  right there, riding across the
                  fjords like a valiant, pungent
                  reindeer king! Come on!

   The walls crack under the ice pressure.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Look out!

   They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.


   INT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- DAY

   Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and
   block their path.

                            OLAF
                  We're trapped.

   Anna looks around desperately for a way out.

   EXT. FJORD -- DAY

   Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind.


   EXT. CASTLE -- DAY

   Anna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it
   sweeps the window panes away.

                            OLAF
                  Slide, Anna.

   It's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have?
   They slide down the iced-covered building.

   Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers
   snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant
   snowball.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  We made it!

   He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.


   EXT. FJORD -- DAY

   Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across
   the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the
   storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight
   through.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Come on, buddy, faster.



                                                     CUT TO:

   Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.

                              ANNA
                  Kristoff!

   The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling
   off into the storm.

                            OLAF
                  Keep going, Anna!

   Anna struggles on.
                                                              104

                              ANNA
                  Kristoff!

                                                       PAN TO:

   Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven
   struggles over the uneven surface.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Come on! Come on!

   Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them.
   They give it all they've got as debris falls all   around them
   and the mast shatters. They make it past just as   the entire
   ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath   their feet.

   The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too
   wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing
   water and disappears below.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Sven? Sven!

   At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy
   water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a
   floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to
   go on.

                              KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Good boy.

                                                       CUT TO:

   Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna's hands frost over
   an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she's running
   out of time.

   She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the
   inevitable is coming.

                                                       CUT TO:

   Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to
   turn. But then he hears a faint--

                              ANNA (O.S.)
                  Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna...? Anna!

                                                  WHITE OUT TO:
                                                              105

   Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is
   consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It's Hans.

                            HANS
                  Elsa. You can't run from this!

   Elsa backs away from him.

                            ELSA
                  ...Just take care of my sister.

                            HANS
                  Your sister? She returned from the
                  mountain weak and cold. She said
                  you froze her heart.

                              ELSA
                  What? No.

                            HANS
                  I tried to save her, but it was too
                  late. Her skin was ice. Her hair
                  turned white...

   Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  Your sister is dead... because of
                  you.

   Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that,
   the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air,
   hangs suspended, trapped in grief.

   Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out
   to see...

   Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the
   fjords to...

                            ANNA
                      (a whisper)
                  Kristoff.

                              KRISTOFF
                  Anna.

   Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards
   her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is
   giving it all he's got. He's going to make it.

   But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from
   its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he
   raises his sword over his head.

FROZEN - J. Lee



                              ANNA
                  Elsa.

   Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him
   a longing look, but then turns away from him and then...

   Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword
   down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  No!

   In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits
   her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force
   of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out.

                              ELSA
                  Anna!

   Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.

   Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.

                            OLAF
                      (confused, sad)
                  Anna?

   Elsa hugs Anna and cries.

   Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his
   side.

   Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads.

   All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence.

   But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw.

   Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up.

   Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa.

                            ELSA
                  Wha-? Anna?

   Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved.

                              ANNA
                  Oh, Elsa.

   They embrace.
                                                              107
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            ELSA
                  ...You sacrificed yourself for me?

                             ANNA
                      (weak)
                  ...I love you.

   Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he
   lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--

                            OLAF
                  An act of true love will thaw a
                  frozen heart.

                            ELSA
                      (processing)
                  Love...will thaw...
                      (realizing)
                  Love.... Of course.

   Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa?

                            ELSA
                  Love.

   Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The
   ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air.

   Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws.

   The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves.

   The villagers come out to see the warmth returning.

   In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant
   snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm
   summer day.

                            ANNA
                  I knew you could do it.

                            OLAF
                      (melting, good-naturedly)
                  Hands down, this is the best day of
                  my life...and quite possibly the
                  last.

                            ELSA
                  Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.
                                                                  108
FROZEN - J. Lee



   Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold
   air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little,
   perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it.

                            OLAF
                  Hey, my own personal flurry.

   Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches
   toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and
   stops him.

                            ANNA
                  Uh. Uh. Uh.

   She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.

                            HANS
                      (confused)
                  Anna? But she froze your heart.

                            ANNA
                  The only frozen heart around here
                  is yours.

   She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet
   satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.

                            HANS
                  Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

   He falls overboard.

   Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder,
   Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


   EXT. ARENDELLE -- DAY

   It's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been
   repaired and are sailing away.

   On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig.

                            FRENCH DIGNITARY
                      (to Kai)
                  I will return this scoundrel to his
                  country. We shall see what his
                  twelve big brothers think of his
                  behavior.

                            KAI
                  Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.
                                                           109
FROZEN - J. Lee



   Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two
   thugs to their ship.

                            DUKE
                  This is unacceptable. I am
                  innocent. I'm a victim of fear.
                  I've been traumatized.
                      (bad acting)
                  Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a
                  doctor I could...No? And I demand
                  to see the Queen!

   Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.

                            KAI
                  I have a message from the Queen.
                      (reading a scroll)
                  Arendelle will henceforth and
                  forever no longer do business of
                  any sort with Weaseltown.

                            DUKE
                  Weselton. It's Weselton!

   The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.


   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE -- DAY

   Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff
   along behind her. She's so excited she can't stand it.

                            ANNA
                  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

   She runs him right into a pole.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Pole.

                            ANNA
                  Oops. Sorry.


   EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS -- DAY

   Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops.

                            ANNA
                      (stopping)
                  Okay. Okay. Here we are.
                                                           110
FROZEN - J. Lee



   She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before
   him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in
   front of it -- Vanna White-style.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I owe you a sled.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (blown away)
                  Are you serious?

                            ANNA
                  Yes. And it's the latest model.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No. I can't accept this...

                            ANNA
                  You have to. No returns. No
                  exchanges. Queen's orders. She's
                  named you the official Arendelle
                  Ice Master and Deliverer.

   Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's
   king of the bucks.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What? That's not a thing.

   But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.

                            ANNA
                  Sure it is. And it even has a cup
                  holder.... Do you like it?

                             KRISTOFF
                  Like it?

   He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I love it.... I could kiss you!

   He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  ...I could. I mean I'd like to.
                  I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may
                  we? Wait, what?

   She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.

                             ANNA
                  We may.
                                                              111
FROZEN - J. Lee



   He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright.

   We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.

   With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the
   flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.

   Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks
   the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.

   Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the
   carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it
   belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf
   doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.

                                                       CUT TO:


   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY

   The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard,
   stands Elsa.

                            ELSA
                  Are you ready?

   Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The
   people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.

   Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds
   some snow flurries for atmosphere.

   Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.

                            ANNA
                  I like the open gates.

                            ELSA
                  We are never closing them again.

   Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally
   made of ice) form on Anna's boots.

                            ANNA
                  What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
                  but you know I don't ska--

   Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna
   slips and slides, but laughs in delight.

   Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Look out. Reindeer coming through!
                                                                 112
FROZEN - J. Lee



   Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna.

                            OLAF
                  That's it. Glide and pivot and
                  glide and pivot.

   We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye
   view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been
   repaired with a ice.

   All is right in Arendelle.

                                                   FINAL FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT

	CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

	Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

	EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT

	Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN 
	in tuxedo moves into:

	INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

	THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
	to the ballroom.

	ANGLE - COAT CHECK

	The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
	When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
	a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

	He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
	ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
	fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
	sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
	models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

	A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
	AID FOUNDATION"

	Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
	sets on another waiter's passing tray.

				ROBERTS (V.O.)
		Richard...

	DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
	of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

				ROBERTS
		Cancun. Nat just talked everybody 
		into it...

	A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

				KIMBLE 
		So, what's the deal? If the hospital 
		buys ten new -

				NAT
		No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
		Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
		has no ulterior motives.

				KIMBLE 
		On the house, huh?
			(to bartender)
		Tonic water with lime.

	Everyone agrees.

				KIMBLE 
		Never get me to sell my soul for one
		of those trips...

	His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

				KIMBLE
			(to Nat)
	 	... But if you get any more Bulls 
		tickets, Nat, give me a call.

	The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS
	CONTINUE OVER -

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Moving through the crowd.

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary 
	golf swing.

				KIMBLE 
		You're slicing, Dave. Don't turn 
		your hip.

	He keeps moving.

				GOLFING MAN 
		Thanks, Richard...

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT

	KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
	elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
	T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

				DR. WAHLUND 
			(dripping sarcasm)
		I'm so glad you talked me into 
		coming, Richard... I can pick my
		cruise wardrobe.

				RICHARD 
		It's for a good cause, Kath... 
		Besides you need to get out of the
		lab more. Your electron microscope
		is starting to give you a tan.

	She smiles. He moves on.

	ANGLE - PARTY

	Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

				KIMBLE
		Hey, Jim.

	DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
	University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I just saw someone who 
		wanted to meet you...

	Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
	wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
	a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
	catch a look and hold it.

				NICHOLS (V.O.)
		Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
		is working on the RDU90 trials for 
		Devlin-Macgregor.

	Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
	smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

				LENTZ
		Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
		trading phone calls last few days 
		... something about a biopsy report 
		I returned to you?

				KIMBLE
			(suddenly attentive)
		Yeah... Three. Livers appeared 
		hepatetic to me.

				LENTZ
		I'll be in my office in the morning 
		and I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
		a good time for you?

				KIMBLE
		Sure.

				LENTZ
			(holds Kimble's look, 
			then to Nichols)
		See you, Jim.

	Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
	on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
	Nichols move together through the party.

				NICHOLS
			(digs in his pocket)
		Before I forget, I went by the garage
		this afternoon and picket up the 
		Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

	He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

				KIMBLE
		They fix it this time?

				NICHOLS
		We'll see.

	They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
	Kimble kisses her.

				NICHOLS
		You look fabulous, Helen.

	He kisses Helen.

				HELEN (WOMAN)
		Hello, Jim.

				NICHOLS
			(to Kimble)
		We've got a court tomorrow at three.

	Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

				KIMBLE
		Well, I've seen everyone, can we 
		leave?

				HELEN
		That would be a little abrupt, don't 
		you think?

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT

	A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
	others at table ant sit across from each other.

	Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
	mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
	OLDER WIFE.

	Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
	her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
	CONTINUE...

	INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
	changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
	of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
	catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
	his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
	ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
	of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
	"not yet."

	As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

	"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
	at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
	"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
	you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
	'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

	Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
	watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
	her head.

				NOW EAU WIFE
			(to table)
		I told my husband that he was going 
		to kill us if he didn't stop 
		operating. What with this AIDS thing, 
		he's putting us all at risk.

	Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
	a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

				HELEN
			(to her dinner partners)
		I'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
		home.

	They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
	shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we

	Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
	his hair as he drives.

				HELEN
		You looked handsome tonight...

				KIMBLE
		Thank you...

	He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
	for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

				HELEN
		Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
		like waiters...

				KIMBLE
		But me?

				HELEN
		You looked more like... a band 
		director.

	He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
	changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

				HELEN
		Are we home yet?...

		When? Okay, tell them I'll be there 
		in ten minutes.

	He hangs up.

				KIMBLE
		Tim's got a problem.

	Helen kisses him again, opens the door.

	Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

	SCRUB ROOM

	Kimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring 
	him up to speed.

				RESIDENT
		Patient is a male, forty-three. We 
		pulled his gall bladder and the 
		bleeding started.

				KIMBLE
		What's his pro time?

				RESIDENT
			(concerned)
		He's at 36 seconds. We got a major

				KIMBLE
		You talk to the family?

				RESIDENT
		None. He's off the street.

	CUT TO:


	INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

	Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with 
	trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble 
	is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both 
	working so intently they never look at each other as they 
	talk...

				KIMBLE
			(to Anesthesiologist)
		Okay... I'm clamping. Can he 
		tolerate it?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		He's a very sick guy.

				KIMBLE
		Do we have a choice?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		Go for it.

				KIMBLE
		Marie, give me a clamp...

	MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble 
	and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident 
	assisting.

				KIMBLE
			(never looking up)
		Your husband know you're here tonight,
		Marie?... What about this liver?

				RESIDENT
		History's sketchy. Could be an 
		alcoholic.

				KIMBLE
		Who referred him?

				RESIDENT
		He's on a drug protocol. RDU90.

	Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident 
	over their masks, then back to work.

				KIMBLE
		The wave of the future... Marie, you 
		told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous 
		of this late night thing we've got 
		going here... This should hold him. 
		Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a

			(to circulating nurse)
		Send it downstairs and make sure you

				SURGEON
		You staying for the closing, Rich?

	Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

				KIMBLE
		No. I got a date.

	INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind

	Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with

	INT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

	Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

	Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on 
	the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close 
	one of the interior closet doors.

	She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

	A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
	claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her 
	string of pearls bursts...

	... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls 
	across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from 
	the top.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the 
	driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still 
	on.

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on 
	the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and 
	calls up the stairs.

				KIMBLE
		I'm home. Did you hear who won the 
		Bulls game?

	No answer. He steps into the:

	KITCHEN

	The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The 
	WASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer,
	and STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two 
	glassesand leaves the kitchen.

	INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT

	Lies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of 
	phone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the

	Kimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Helen's hand reaches out presses the cradle down, dials

	ON KIMBLE

	Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops.

	A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks 
	it up... a pearl.

				KIMBLE
		Helen?

	Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. 
	Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

	UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

	Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
	he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
	Adrenal surge.

	Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
	free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
	The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
	leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
	sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
	landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
	hall below.

	SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

	The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
	catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
	shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

	Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
	Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
	face...

	The SIRENS are LOUDER...

	Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
	down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

	Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped 
	by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

				HELEN (O.S.)
		He's here... still in the house...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one

				HELEN
		He's trying to kill me...

	Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.

	Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she 
	was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her 
	leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

				KIMBLE
		Hang on, babe... going to be all 
		right.

	Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

				HELEN
		My head. Richard my hold me.

	Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her 
	head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes 
	she won't be all right.

	CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

	The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious 
	neighbors, television news vans, etc.

	Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van 
	arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.

	INT. 11TH STREET DISTRICT HOUSE - NIGHT

	CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" 
	shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: 
	KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, 
	aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

				KIMBLE
		It was .38... I think. I only saw it 
		for a second. I knocked it out of 
		his hand.

	As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the

	Kimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems 
	to sense something aggressive in their questioning.

	They no longer seem on the same team.

				KIMBLE
		What's going on here? This guy was 
		trying to rob us.

	The two cops stare at Kimble.

				KIMBLE
		You guys have got to be out of your

	KIBLE'S POV - THE JURY

	A few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken 
	out of context.

	NICHOLS ON THE STAND

				PROSECUTOR
		Dr. Nichols. You are aware that 
		Richard Kimble was the only 
		beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate.
		12 million dollars roughly.

				NICHOLS
		I was aware of that. The money meant 
		nothing to him.

				PROSECUTOR
		Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
		once said that 'if he had Helen's 
		money he could find plenty of uses.'
		Did he not?

				NICHOLS
		We were talking about -

				PROSECUTOR
		Yes or no?

	Nichols' look tells us everything... Yes.

	Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the 
	jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

				PROSECUTOR
		How tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?

				KIMBLE
		I can't be sure. We were, mostly on 
		the floor, fighting... I couldn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Did that fight cause the scratches 
		on your face and arms?

				KIMBLE
		No. As I explained -

				PROSECUTOR
		And how did this man enter your 
		house?

				KIMBLE
		I don't know -

				PROSECUTOR
		And you probably don't know why your 
		wife told the emergency operator You 
		were her attacker?

				KIMBLE
		She didn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Your name is Richard, isn't it? Your 
		gun is a .38, isn't it? Your prints 
		were on the gun, the bullets, the

	INT. COURTROOM - DAY

	Richard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a

		After careful and studied review of

	Kimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence 
	shockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear 
	doors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's 
	satisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, 
	lowers his head. Disbelief.

	ANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE

	He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by 
	bailiff. Gutherie whispers an "I'm sorry." Kimble doesn't 
	hear it.

	INT. BUS - DAY

	The four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer 
	chained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing...

	The two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG 
	GUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns 
	bouncing on their knees. Prisoner #l shifts his gaze to...

	The driver. Pistol on his hip.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging:

				PRISONER #1
		Hey. Illinois penal regulations 
		require a meal for transport
		rides of four hours or more.

	Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
	Checks his watch: 4:00.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Jack! Feedin' time.

	Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
	belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

	PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
	the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
	aisle...

	PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
	between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
	CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
	plastic shank.

	Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
	handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
	a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

				COPELAND
		Breathe, and you're first.

	Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
	carelessly ready.

	Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
	doesn't respond.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Suit yourself.

	He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
	sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

	Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

				KIMBLE
		Look out!

	Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
	Young Guard's gut.

	Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
	out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

	Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
	floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
	inside, but...

	Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
	Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under
	the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

	Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing

	Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat.

	Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the 
	Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes 
	off target as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
	and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the 
	bottom of a small ravine.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

	On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
	him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
	at...

	Kimble. Rising between the seats.

	A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
	off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

	Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
	find Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
			(to Kimble)
		You. You're a doctor. C'mere.

	He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
	medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

				OLD GUARD
		Do something.

	Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
	his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
	Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
	Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

				KIMBLE
		He isn't going to make it unless he 
		gets to a hospital. Fast.

				OLD GUARD
		ZL.

	In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it 
	just settling?

	With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
	Guard's bleeding.

	ANGLE UNDER SEAT

	We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
	back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the 
	opening.

	BACK TO KIMBLE

	A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
	retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
	growing vibration.

				KIMBLE
		Just where the hell are we?

	The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
	looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

				OLD GUARD
		Oh, shit...


	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
	grows bright by the light of an approaching train.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young 
	Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles 
	the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

	The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
	snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

				KIMBLE
		Which one? This? This one?!

	Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
	the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

				KIMBLE
		Help me get him -

	But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out 
	the shattered windshield.

	ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS

	Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...

	EXT. BUS - NIGHT

	... and hits the ground running the other way. The 
	locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should 
	Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard 
	hold a look.

	EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT

	As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard 
	behind him. He slings the man clear.

	SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

	For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

	The train light X-rays him.

	Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
	away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
	dozen mincing steps before...

	IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
	splitting it open.

	Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
	feet, still running feverish half-steps.

	An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
	flanks.

	The train burns past the wounded Guard.

	Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
	him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

	Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
	after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
	chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

	The train burrows to a stop.

	Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
	of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
	nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
	something in his hand.

	It's the key-ring.

	EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. 
	Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		Give me that.

	Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
	own chains.

				COPELAND
		You listen to me. I don't give a 
		damn which way you go, just don't 
		follow me.

	Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his 
	arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the 
	other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT

	News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing 
	smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines 
	hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work 
	feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled 
	wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation 
	investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted 
	remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

	Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. 
	marshals emerge:

	BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick 
	shithouse.

	RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds 
	fully-equipped.

	POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during 
	nut-cuttin' time.

	NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

	From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media 
	spectacle.

				GERARD
		Good lord...

				REFRO
		What is this... a circus?

	As a group they begin moving along the service road above 
	the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below 
	them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they 
	walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

	Biggs spots something...

				BIGGS
		Point of impact.

	... and branches off.

				GERARD
		Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.

				BIGGS
		Shit.
			(to Newman)
		Come on.

	They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain 
	with Gerard.

	A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he
	sees Gerard's Marshall star.

				GERARD
		How ya doing? Who's in charge?

				TROOPER
		Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the 
		lights -

	Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the 
	scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

	Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
	about to happen.

	ANGLE - OLD GUARD

	Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
	shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
	SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote 
	news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the 
	b.g., listening.

				OLD GUARD
		... train was bearin' down on us, 
		fast. I don't know how - it's still 
		kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
		and pushed him out of the bus.

				SHERIFF
		You coulda both been killed.

				OLD GUARD
		I know, but hell, he's my partner.
		Woulda done the same for me.

	The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard 
	eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

				GERARD
		Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy 
		U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.

				SHERIFF
			(annoyed)
		I'll be with you in a minute.

	The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
	his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos 
	of all four prisoners.

				SHERIFF
			(to Old Guard)
		For the record. These three dead. 
		And this one...

	He switches to a photo of Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
		Well, everything happened so fast...
			(bites lip, decides)
		Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

	Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred 
	prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

				SHERIFF
		You get some rest.

	He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

				SHERIFF
		Looks like you came a long way for 
		nothing. My men've already done a 
		thorough search from point of 
		impact and found nothing.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	ANGLE - CULVERT

	Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees 
	something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

	GERARD

	Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

				GERARD
		With all due respect, may I suggest 
		check-points starting at a 15-mile 
		radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east 
		of -

				SHERIFF
		Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? 
		Prisoners are all dead. The only 
		thing check-points will do is get a 
		lot of good people out here frantic 
		and flood my office with calls.

	Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and 
	we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

				GERARD
			(beat)
		Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for 
		that to happen... So, I'll be 
		taking over the investigation.

				SHERIFF
		On whose authority?

				GERARD
		By authority of the Governor of the 
		State of Illinois and the office of
		the United States Marshal, 5th 
		District Northern Illinois...

	Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents 
	from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

				SHERIFF
			(back-down beat)
		Okay. You want jurisdiction over 
		this mess, you got it.
			(to assistants)
		Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
		mop up for us.

	He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
	Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
	manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

	Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
	a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

				GERARD
		Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
		back and give this poor man some 
		room.

	Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a 
	change of story and command.

	Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the 
	Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

				GERARD
			(friendly, to Old 
			Guard)
		Always an interesting thing when we 
		find leg irons and no legs in them 
		who held the keys, sir?

				OLD GUARD
		Uh, me.

				GERARD
		Would you be so kind as to show them
		to me, sir?

	Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

	The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the 
	press hovering just out of earshot.

				GERARD
		Second chance.

	Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

	The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

				OLD GUARD
			(cracking)
		He mighta got out.

				GERARD
		Thank you.

				SHERIFF
		What the hell is this? A minute ago 
		you tell me he's part of the 
		wreckage, now you're -

				GERARD
		Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want 
		an accurate body count. Poole - Set 
		up operations right here.

	He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving 
	downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like 
	Israelites behind Moses.

				GERARD
		Ladies and gentlemen... our 
		fugitive's been on the run for 
		ninety minutes. Average foot speed 
		over uneven ground - barring injury 
		is approximately four miles an hour, 
		giving us a radius of six miles. I 
		want a hard-target search of any 
		residence, gas station, farmhouse, 
		henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in 
		that area. Check-points go up at 
		15 miles.
			(to media)
		You got that? Good. Now, turn 
		those damn things off and get out 
		of our way.

	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a
	dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

	EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

	Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. 
	The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment 
	later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

	EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with 
	blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's 
	going to need stitches.

	Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps 
	moving.

	EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN

	Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction 
	of the lights.

	A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the 
	road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 
	mile.

	ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM

	Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
	nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
	He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
	jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
	breath.

	Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
	the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
	cover behind the wrecked car.

	The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
	seat and closes the door.

	He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
	something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
	and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the 
	coveralls missing from the seat.

	As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
	side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
	clutching the coveralls.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN

	A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the 
	crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone 
	lines are pulled down from the lines running along the 
	tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

	Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and 
	relays it to Gerard.

				POOLE
		Blood trail found. Two miles 
		southwest.

				GERARD
			(to Biggs)
		Type it and match it against all 
		four prisoners.
			(to Renfro)
		Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to 
		every local hospital.
			(to Newman)
		Newman...

	Newman appears.

				NEWMAN
		Yes, sir...

				GERARD
		I need some coffee.

	As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING 
	from the train crash.

	ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH

	A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

				WORKER
		Hey, one's alive!

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

	Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food 
	outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck 
	operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. 
	Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

	A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a 
	bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us.
	Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front 
	of the doorway.

	KIMBLE'S POV - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM

	CUT TO:

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble closes the door and locks it. Hanging on the back of 
	the door we see a doctor's white coat.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

	An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside.

	CUT TO:

	CLOTH-COVERED INSTRUMENT TRAY

	On it we see: A packaged sterilized bandage, an opened 
	antiseptic wash, an opened topical anesthetic, and an empty 
	syringe. We PULL BACK to find:

	KIMBLE

	His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches 
	already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as 
	he sutures himself.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LONG SHOT (MOS) - MORNING

	At far end of the hall we see a STATE TROPER chatting with a 
	DUTY NURSE at a nurses' station.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROCEDURE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot 
	of antibiotics.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY

	A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes 
	closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.

	KIMBLE
	Can you hear me, sir?

	No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the 
	patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his 
	clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched 
	breakfast tray.

	CUT TO:

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - NURSES' DUTY STATION - DAY

	The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins 
	coming through on DESK FAX.

				NURSE

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble dressing in the man's clothes. He eats a piece of 
	toast - part of the man's breakfast - as he buttons up his 
	shirt.

	ANGLE - PATIENT

	His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call 
	button.

	CUT TO:

	INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

	A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the 
	duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the 
	patient's call light comes on.

	The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the 
	patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the 
	patient's room.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the 
	patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

				DUTY NURSE (O.S.)
		Mr. Patterson, do you need some more 
		water?

	ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST

	The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.

				DUTY NURSE
		... Oh, you did a good job on this.

	She takes his empty plastic pitcher and...

	... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and 
	refills the pitcher from the sink.

				DUTY NURSE
			(over her shoulder, 
			to patient)
		... It does get dry in here, doesn't 
		it?

	She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes 
	into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind 
	it.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and 
	a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency 
	room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the 
	E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts 
	down the corridor toward Kimble.

	The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

				TROOPER
		'Scuse me, Doc?...

	Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. 
	doors behind him.

				TROOPER
		... Don't know if you heard or not 
		but we're looking for an escaped 
		prisoner from that bus train wreck 
		'couple hours ago. Thought he might 
		show up here if he was hurt.

				KIMBLE
		What's he look like?

	The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow 
	trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down 
	Kimble's cheek.

				TROOPER
			(from fax sheet)
		Approximately six one, 180 pounds, 
		brown hair, brown eyes and beard.

	At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes 
	it clean as the Trooper looks up.

				TROOPER
		... Seen anyone that fits that 
		description?

				KIMBLE
		Every time I look in the mirror ...
		but without the beard.

	They laugh.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me...

				TROOPER
		Sure.

	Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks 
	outside...

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY

	Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The 
	lead wheels are stuck.

				KIMBLE
		Here...

	Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney 
	comes free.

				PARAMEDIC #2
		Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out 
		from under a train.

	As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face 
	of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

				YOUNG GUARD
		It's him... It's -

	Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young 
	Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

				KIMBLE
		How is he?

	The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

				PARAMEDIC #1
		He's pretty bad off. Broken leg, 
		ribs. Concussion.

	As Kimble moves away...

				KIMBLE
		Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got 
		a perforated spleen.

	He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk 
	the Young Guard inside.

				PARAMEDIC #2
			(impressed)
		Jesus, how could he tell that from 
		looking at his face?

	ANGLE - AMBULANCE

	Kimble climbs behind the wheel.

	EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	A full communications link is in place.

	Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information 
	to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole 
	calls Gerard.

				POOLE
		Background just came in from 
		Chicago.

				GERARD
		Hit me.

	Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of 
	information comes clear and fast.

				RENFRO
		Richard David Kimble. Vascular 
		Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree 
		murder in the killing of his wife. 
		Pleaded innocent. Claimed a 
		one-armed -

				GERARD
		Let's not retry the case. Priors
		and accomplices?

	Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the 
	investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.

				RENFRO
		None. No previous arrests.

	Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard 
	unzips his fly and relieves himself.

				GERARD
		Sealed juvie record?

	Poole calls out from behind tree.

				POOLE
		Nothing. Total cherry.

				GERARD
		Relatives? Children?

				RENFRO
		No relatives.

				POOLE
		One child. A son. Died in drowning 
		accident three years ago.

				GERARD
		Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends? 
		Combinations of the above?

				POOLE
		Lot of friends. Doctors. Hospital 
		staff.

	Gerard zips up.

				GERARD
		Start there. Authorize taps. Cover
		his lawyer first.

				RENFRO
		Never get it.

				GERARD
		Bet me.

	Renfro won't take it.

				GERARD
		Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, 
		he'll sign 'em.

	... Biggs charges up the hillside.

				BIGGS

		Ambulance, missing too.

	ANGLE - SITUATION TENT

	Gerard moves quickly to the map.

				GERARD
		Give me a time.

				BIGGS
		O-nine-thirty. Twenty minutes ago.

	Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we 
	covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn, 
	tightened, with the hospital as its center. The 
	triangulation is set.

	EXT. RURAL RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

	The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad 
	crossing. The biocom monitors police chatter:

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		Two-twelve-A, be advised that all 
		discussion on this matter is to be 
		conducted on a tactical frequency 
		- either Channel K or Z. Over.

	Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield:

	ROAD SIGN

	An arrow points toward Canton, two miles.

	The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal 
	suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops 
	the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and 
	heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets 
	attention.

	INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

	Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and 
	reaches for his C.B. radio.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

	Poole hangs up phone.

				POOLE
		Ambulance just spotted two miles 
		west of Doverville. Heading north 
		on State road 53.

	Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much 
	smaller.

				RENFRO
		Running outta map, Sam.

	The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is 
	ready to move.

				GERARD
		Just the way we want it. Okay, 
		people, let's button up.

	They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and 
	eyeballs folded roadmap...

	EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance. 
	Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain.

				PILOT
			(into radio)
		We've got a visual...
			(to Gerard)
		He's heading toward the viaduct.

				GERARD
		Seal it up.

	EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY

	The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred 
	feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.

	The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into 
	the tunnel.

	ON KIMBLE

	Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at 
	the mouth of the tunnel.

	Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.

	ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)

	Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far 
	entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.

	ANGLE HELICOPTER

	Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.

	KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE

	Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. 
	Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.

	EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking 
	the other end.

	Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a 
	State patrol car blares:

				P.A. (V.O.)
		Please remain in your vehicles and 
		lock your doors. Repeat, please 
		remain in -

	ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

	Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar. 
	They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a 
	vest.

				RENFRO
		Got him.

	Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.

				GERARD
		Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard 
		part's over.

	He starts into the tunnel.

				RENFRO
			(to radio)
		We're movin' in.

	INT. TUNNEL - DAY

	Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three 
	silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' 
	P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb 
	back inside and lock their doors.

	Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the 
	middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

	Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the 
	ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain 
	clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

	Running water.

	ON MARSHALS

	They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks 
	around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks 
	confused.

				POOLE
		Where'd he go?

	Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until 
	he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.

				GERARD
		Biggs, Renfro with me.

	INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows 
	at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. 
	A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips 
	off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues 
	straight ahead.

	Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit
	wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong 
	to...

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the 
	forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

				GERARD
		Channel Three.

	They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go 
	left. Gerard - straight ahead.

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy 
	downslope.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Biggs and Renfro. Sweeping his light as he advances. 
	Searching for splash-patterns.

				BIGGS
			(into shoulder-mike)
		Nothing yet.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard. Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light. About to 
	pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the 
	branch-off tunnel. Hand marks?

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Got a possible here. Stand by.

	He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with 
	three limbs

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. 
	Slips again...

	... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

	Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. 
	Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
	lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
	there first.

	It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
	flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

				KIMBLE
		I didn't kill my wife.

				GERARD
		So, you didn't kill your wife.

	Not my problem.

	An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
	silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

				BIGGS (V.O.)
		Gerard? You there?

	Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

	Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up 
	piece.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro 
	appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...

				GERARD
		Straight ahead!

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance 
	in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead 
	lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is 
	incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and 
	stops.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam 
	disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of 
	mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

	He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.

	ANGLE - MARSHALS

	Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a 
	shooting stance.

				GERARD
		Turn around, hands over your head. 
		And get down on the ground.

	For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

				GERARD
		Your choice, Kimble...

	Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
	water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
	up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
	water toward Kimble.

				GERARD
		Get down on your knees.

	Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the 
	footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY

	Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap 
	into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into 
	the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

	INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY

	Renfro lowers his gun.

				RENFRO
			(amazed)
		Son of a bitch...

	It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

	ON GERARD

	He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He 
	stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him 
	something invaluable about this fugitive.

	EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY

	Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam 
	near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search 
	helicopter converge on the site.

	EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

	Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

	The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down 
	stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET

	Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the 
	shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

	Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

	FROM SHORE

	Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
	the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
	ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Running out of daylight, Inspector.

				GERARD
		Lights and generators are coming, 
		Captain.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Look, I don't mean to tell you your 
		job, but maybe one person in a 
		million could've survived that fall.
		The guy's fish food.

	Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

				GERARD
		Then find me the fish that ate him.

	He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

	EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

	Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a 
	sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, 
	exhausted.

	KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY

	ANGLE

	Helen in bed. Kimble's hand comes INTO FRAME and touches 
	her shoulder. She turns toward Kimble as he moves INTO 
	FRAME and kisses her.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	ANGLE

	Helen tosses her head back. She wears white silk pajamas 
	and smiles down AT us. A hand reaches up and unbuttons the 
	top two buttons of her top. Then Kimble moves up INTO FRAME 
	as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BEACH - DAY

	Helen running down beach TOWARD us. Embraces Kimble as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POOL - DAY

	Helen's head comes up out of a pool. Hair tossed back, she 
	smiles as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Helen exiting Kimble's car the night of the murder. She 
	looks back at Kimble, framed by the door frame, ant smiles.

				HELEN
		Good-bye. I love you.

	Again... Then again... then:

	HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. FOREST - MORNING

	Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He 
	remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.

	EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING

	Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into 
	tunnel.

	INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

	Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for 
	party 
	to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

	Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

	ANGLE - PHONE

	Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear 
	RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan 
		and Wainwright.

				KIMBLE
		Walter Gutherie please.

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left 
		for the day, would you like his 
		voice mail?

	Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front 
	of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the 
	shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he 
	sees the pharmacist looking at him.

	EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a 
	new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, 
	moves down the road to the diner.

	INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER 
	WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and 
	tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need to look at the menu?

				KIMBLE
		Some soup, please.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Good choice.

	She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around 
	Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

	A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
	stares at him.

	A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
	away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
	he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

	Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
	his soup. Where's the first waitress?

	Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
	sees:

	The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
	going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

	A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

	ANGLE - TV

	A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the 
	chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death 
	from the fall.

	Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on 
	the counter and exits.

	EXT. DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until 
	he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of 
	the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

	Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both 
	sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly 
	hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
	faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
	a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
	inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
	chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
	looks at himself. He's shaking.

	A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next 
	to him, passenger window rolls down...

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need a ride?

	Kimble stares at her.

				KIMBLE
		Which way are you going?

	She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. 
	They hold a look as we hear:

				RENFRO (V.O.)
		We feel confident about the I.D.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

	A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless 
	woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly 
	down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just 
	early morning traffic.

	We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the 
	street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
	that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
	woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
	radio.

				RENFRO
		Local officials were about to wet 
		their pants to move in.

				GERARD
		I bet they were.
			(to radio)
		Where's the woman?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	BIGGS

	In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

				RENFRO
			(into radio)
		Same room.

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and 
		Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. 
		I don't want anyone hurt. Stay 
		outside unless called. Radios on 
		three.

	The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his 
	service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.

				NEWMAN
		Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?

				GERARD
		Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
		Let's go.

	EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAWN

	DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of 
	the door.

				GERARD
		U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!

	INT. HOUSE - DAWN

	Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

	THEIR POV

	Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
	OF VIEW.

	A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

	GERARD

	Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
	room while he moves down the main hall into the back 
	bedroom.

	ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN

	Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
	off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
	He steps into -

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
	the bedroom.

	HALLWAY

	Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
	continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
	woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
	silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
	opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
	the doorway to the kitchen.

	Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
	He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
	Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

	CUT TO:

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
	didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

	COPELAND

	Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
	Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
	knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
	room.

	We...

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		I got your man! Now I want outta 
		here!

	Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
	woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
	fugitive.

	ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN

	Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
	through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

	LIVING ROOM

	Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
	his throat.

				COPELAND
			(to Gerard)
		You hear me? I said, I want out or 
		I'll cut your man's throat!

	GERARD

	Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
	at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

	LIVING ROOM

	Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
	hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

	Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
	whips Newman around and we see:

	A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
	late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

	He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
	The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
	stunned but unhurt.

	Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
	bedroom doorway.

				GERARD
		Shut up.

	She does. Immediately.

	EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

	As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
	the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
	sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
	hysterical, clutching his ear.

				NEWMAN
		My ear... I can't hear a thing out 
		of it. I can't believe you did that!

				GERARD
		You think I should have bargained 
		with him, don't you?

				NEWMAN
		Yes. You could've missed! You 
		could've killed me!

				GERARD
		Yeah, you're absolutely right. I 
		could've.

	They hold a look.

				GERARD
		How bad's your ear?

				NEWMAN
		Terrible. I probably have permanent 
		hearing damage.

				GERARD
		Let me see it.

	Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

				GERARD
		I don't bargain.

	Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
	unsettling man Gerard is.

	EXT. CHICAGO PAY PHONE - MORNING

	Kimble makes call. While he waits for phone to be answered 
	TRAINS COME and GO in the b.g. An EL CROSSES OVERHEAD. The 
	BELLS of Chicago River DRAWBRIDGE.

				KIMBLE
		Walter. It's Richard.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. LAW OFFICES OF GUTHERIE, MORGAN AND WAINWRIGHT - DAY

	Walter Gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking 
	Lake Michigan.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard... Jesus, why did you run? 
		Running only makes you look guilty.

				KIMBLE
		I wasn't worrying about appearances, 
		Walter.
	
				GUTHERIE
		Tell me where you are. I'll come
		meet you so you can turn yourself 
		in .

				KIMBLE
		I'm not turning myself in. I need 
		money.

	Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on 
	the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard. You're asking me to harbor
		and aid a convicted felon... I can't
		help you that way. My advice - both 
		as a friend and as your legal counsel 
		- is for you to give yourself up. 
		Now tell me... where are you?

	Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

				KIMBLE
			(beat)
		St. Louis.

				GUTHERIE
		Give me an address. I'll be -

	CLICK. Gutherie hears the LINE GO DEAD. Kimble's gone.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

	Kimble stands in the doorway with cup of coffee. He considers 
	his next move. Then seeing bank clock flash the time: 9:30 -
	he knows what that move is.

	INT. NORTH BANK TENNIS CLUB - DAY

	An upscale mid-town tennis club. Behind glass windows of 
	the entryway we see tennis courts. From the courts comes Dr. 
	Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his 
	tennis bag. A friendly DESK ATTENDANT Sharon) smiles as he 
	goes by.

				DESK ATTENDANT
		See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?

				NICHOLS
		Creature of habit, Sharon.

	EXT. NORTH BANK CLUB - DAY

	Dr. Nichols leaves the club. He tosses his gym bag into the 
	back of his car and drives off.

	INT. / EXT. NICHOLS'S CAR - DAY

	As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves 
	toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield. 
	Nichols waves the man off.

				NICHOLS
		Not today, please.

	The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his 
	passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

				NICHOLS
		No. Not -

	... then stops - the face at his passenger window is 
	Richard Kimble's.

				NICHOLS
			(stunned)
		Oh, my God... Richard...

	Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

				KIMBLE
		How're you doing, Charlie?

				NICHOLS
		You're alive...

				KIMBLE
		Yeah. And I need your help.

				NICHOLS
		Anything.

				KIMBLE
		I need some money. Whatever you've 
		got on you.

				NICHOLS
		Of course.
	
	Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs 
	for his wallet...

				NICHOLS
		Tell me where you're staying. I'll 
		get you more money. Some clothes. 
		Just give me an address...

				KIMBLE
		I'll call you.

	Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks 
	back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the 
	corner and come up the street behind them.

	Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to 
	Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

				NICHOLS
		I know why you came back - to find 
		him. If I can help, call me... 
		Call me.

	They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they 
	don't see it.

				KIMBLE
		Thanks, Charlie...

				NICHOLS
		Here, Richard, take my coat...

	He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car 
	behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview 
	mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

				COP
			(to Nichols)
		Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.

	Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

	INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

	Renfro rewinds the tape. Gerard, Biggs, Poole and Newman.

				POOLE

				GERARD
		Call them back. Tell them you've 
		made a mistake.

				POOLE
		What?

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		Stop it there.

	Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

				GERARD
		Drop the voices.

	Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the 
	BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC, 
	MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the 
	sounds now.

				GERARD
			(he's heard something)
		Listen.

				BIGGS
		Trains? Traffic?

				GERARD
		More... there's a voice in the 
		background.

	At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING 
	MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop 
	Merchandise Mart."

				RENFRO
		That's an El announcement.

				GERARD
		And there's no E1 in St. Louis. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble
		is in Chicago. Poole, get his 
		artwork out to local police and have 
		C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, 
		bring in the detectives that handled 
		his case.

	Instantly the room is in movement.

				STEVENS
		I'll prepare the press release.

				GERARD
		No.

	Stevens stops.

				GERARD
		They don't know he's alive and as 
		far as Kimble knows we don't either. 
		I want to keep it that way as long 
		as we can. Are we clear?

	The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to 
	Kimble.

				RENFRO
			(for the group)
		Perfectly.

	Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.

				GERARD
		Noah... go to my office and let's 
		officially take Dr. Kimble out of

	down hallway and enters.

	He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks 
	around. SEE BACK INTO the office area of the clinic. It 
	could be any hospital clinic from this view.

	But as Kimble turns to leave we see a PATIENT waiting to be 
	called. On his lap we see a prosthetic arm. Kimble looks up 
	from the arm to the man.

	Kimble moves down the hallway containing the janitor's

	INT. KIMBLE'S OLD HOUSE - DAY

	Gerard walks through Kimble's house. The art and most of 
	the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping 
	bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces 
	of furniture.

	Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show 
	where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the 
	place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY

	Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning 
	supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation

	Kimble also at work at the bedside table. He carefully cuts

	existing photograph on the hospital I.D. The name on the 
	I.D. says: Desmondo Jose Ruiz. Then he places a thin piece 
	of lamination plastic and trims the edges.

	Kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look, then 
	examines the finished product not bad.

	He raises an eyebrow.

	INT. DR. NICHOLS' OFFICE - CLOSE ON FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH - DAY

	Of medical residents. Two photographs next to each other. A
	young Richard Kimble and Charles Nichols.

				NICHOLS (O.S.)
		Richard Kimble... I saw him two 
		days ago.

	WE PULL BACK to see: Gerard studying the photos. Renfro 
	looks up like someone's bitten him. He, Biggs and Gerard are 
	in Nichols' administrative office. Gleaming. Filled with 
	awards and photos of Nichols and influential people. Nichols
	hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat. He 
	shows no sign of nervousness.

				NICHOLS
		He stopped me in my car. I gave him 
		some money.

				GERARD
		Where was this?

				NICHOLS
		Outside our tennis -
			(correcting himself)
		 - my tennis club.

	Gerard moves around Nichols' office taking in the details.

				GERARD
		Did he ask you for help?

				NICHOLS
		I volunteered. He wouldn't accept 
		it.

				GERARD
		Why do you think he came back to 
		Chicago?

				NICHOLS
		He didn't tell me.

				GERARD
		I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure
		he was trying to protect you from 
		having to lie for him.

	Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, 
	books, drawings, awards and photos.

				GERARD
		If you're really his friend, you'll 
		help us bring him in unharmed.

				NICHOLS
		Why, so he can go back to prison? 
		If you want help, gentlemen, you've 
		come to the wrong man.

	Gerard finds a photo of Nichols and a gleaming Ferrari.

				GERARD
		Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. 
		Marshals' office closed out 11,003 
		warrants... 10,975 of those were

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble mopping the trauma room hallway. The hallway elbows 
	around a corner and Kimble stands less than ten feet from 
	a door that is marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

	He watches a technician leave the clinic and mops closer to 
	the doorway, and fails to see an attractive WOMAN DOCTOR 
	with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn 
	the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped 
	section.

	Head down, she is completely absorbed in a file and doesn't
	see the wet floor until she slips slightly, looks up but 
	keeps walking.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Where's Rudy?

				KIMBLE
		They said he's sick.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Didn't they tell you to put up the

				KIMBLE
		Uhhh. No they didn't.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Put up the 'wet floor' sign before

	She keeps going.

				KIMBLE
			(mumbles)
		Asshole.

	She looks back at Kimble.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		What did you say?

				KIMBLE
		Nothing.

	Anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall. He watches her 
	turn the corner to the trauma hallway.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab.

	He moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms, 
	hands, legs hanging from the ceiling. Cables and electronic 
	equipment are on the counters.

	He leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the 
	Prosthetic Clinic. He passes a computer room and finally 
	reaches the office. He is about to enter when a woman's 
	voice stops him.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Hey, Ricky... Weren't you just in 
		here?

	Kimble turns to see a PROSTHETIC TECHNICIAN. A large woman 
	with glasses. She stands with a partially finished 
	prosthetic arm.

	"ANNE EASTMAN". She sees him doing the rearranging.

	The elevator arrives. They step into:

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Anne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side.

				ANNE (WOMAN DOCTOR)
		Hey, how're you doing?

				KIMBLE
		Fine.

				ANNE
		You find that sign?

				KIMBLE
		Yes, I did.

				ANNE
		You called me an asshole.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me. I was having a bad

	They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.

				ANNE
		You worked at other hospitals?

				KIMBLE
		Lots of them over the years. Here, 
		long ago. Hasn't changed much.

				ANNE
		I bet it hasn't. See you.

	They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops 
	and watches him leave.

	INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

	Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking 
	at his information.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

	Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets 
	of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over 
	Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, 
	making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
	attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
	for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

	Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
	on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
	covers his face.

	Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
	Prosthetic Clinic material.

	FLASHBACK - FIGHT

	Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's 
	sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

	FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

	Reacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind 
	returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

	FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

	Escaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the 
	STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again.

	Another DOOR SLAMS, but this time the sound is distinctly 
	different... a CAR DOOR.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM (BACK TO PRESENT)

	Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert.

	MOVING TOWARD him.

	Kimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window. 
	Carefully looks out:

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving 
	his way.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

	He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees 
	the back courtyard covered by more cops.

	Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
	he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

	He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of 
	charging through the basement door they move up the front 
	steps and into the house overhead.

	Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

	KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS

	Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He 
	runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, 
	actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and
	pulled away.

	KIMBLE

	Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the 
	Punk Kid out to the car.

	POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.

	Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.

	Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car. His 
	grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying.

	INT. TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic. In passing through 
	the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing. 
	A major accident has happened, victims are being brought in.

	The P.A. CALLS for doctors. STATIC.

	ANGLE ON FAR END OF TRAUMA HALLWAY

	Elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients. 
	Some walk, some are helped by family and police. Nurses 
	direct traffic.

	Orders fly. Medicines are called. Family members yell for 
	doctors. Ask for the injured. Anne picks up the pace with 
	an ORDERLY wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient, 
	a BOY.

				ANNE
		What happened?

				ORDERLY
		A bus flipped off the overpass. Got
		at least twenty more coming in.

				ANNE
		What about this one here?

				ORDERLY
		Fractured sternum. X-ray's coming 
		up.

	Anne checks the boy's chart.

				ANNE
		Okay, we've got to get some room
		in this hallway, people.

	Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out
	of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.

				ANNE
		Hey, take this one up the hall to
		Critical Care.

	Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

	Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the 
	hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays.

	Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble 
	pushing the gurney and looking at the film.

	ANNE

	Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a 
	better look, but Kimble is gone. She goes back to work.

				KIMBLE
		Hey. Hey!

	A Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the 
	gurney.

				KIMBLE
		They just sent this one up.

	He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and 
	yells to O.R. nurse.

				SURGEON
		Bob! Get this one into room four, 
		stat.

	He looks up, Kimble is gone.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The 
	Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman,
	sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the 
	glass-walled computer room and closes the door.

	He closes the blinds and turns on the computer.

		What boy?

				ANNE
		The one with the fractured sternum.

				GLADYS
		He never came in here.

				SURGEON
		Yeah, he brought a kid up.

		Anne, did you write the orders? I 
		couldn't make out the signature...

				ANNE
		I saw -

				SURGEON

		Whoever did knew what the hell he

	DO YOU WISH TO SUBDIVIDE?"

				KIMBLE
		Seventy-five. Hell, yes.

	Kimble types in another defining characteristic...

				GERARD
		Thank you for your help, Doctor.

	He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's 
	gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that

				RENFRO
		What I can't figure is, if you were

	Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices

		The place would be crawling with cops.

	Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and

	The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the 
	Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, 
	holds the hallway door open for Gerard.

				MAN
		Can I help you find something?

	Kimble is on his feet.

	CLEARING OFFICER
	Booth seven. No hands on the glass. Be advised...

	The Clearing Officer, head down, drones on - doesn't notice 
	Kimble is already gone.

	Kimble strides down the row of chairs, rounds the last 
	partition to reach booth seven - and to stare at the 
	one-armed man, DRISCOLL, who waits there.

				DRISCOLL
		So who are you?

		Sorry. I made a mistake.

		Shit, that's okay. Stick around a

	But Kimble is gone. Driscoll calls after him.

		... They're not exactly wired for

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - CORRIDOR - DAY

	Kimble exits the visitor's area. He sees another crowd of 
	COPS around the elevator again, opts for the door marked: 
	"STAIRS"

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

	Biggs and Gerard wait for the elevator. Finally Gerard's 
	had enough.

				GERARD
		Where're the damn stairs?

				BIGGS
		It's five flights!

				GERARD
		Then you wait.

	He finds the door and starts up.

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Kimble descending. Doors open and close throughout the 
	stairwell but the traffic is light...

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims 
	shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.

	Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.

	One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the 
	shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the 
	stairwell railing to spy...

	Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be 
	any dark-haired man. But still...

				GERARD
		(a quick probe)
		Kimble.

	Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two 
	landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain 
	his step, keeps moving.

	But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's 
	stride told him everything.

				GERARD
		Kimble!

	Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

	Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby. 
	Sees two cops, quickly approaches.

				KIMBLE
		Officers - there's a man in the 
		stairwell waving a gun and 
		screaming.

	The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves
	toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak 
	himself in civilians.

	ANGLE ON ELEVATORS

	Biggs' elevator has finally arrived and emptied. He lets a 
	woman on in front of him, oblivious to...

	Kimble moving...

	The revolving exit doors loom nearer ant nearer.

	The two cops see Gerard. Gerard holds up his badge.

				GERARD
		U.S. Marshal! Get on the phone, call
		your commander, tell him there's a 
		top-fifteen warrant in the building. 
		Go.

	He shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs.

	INT. LOBBY - DAY

	Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN 
	sounds.

	People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors 
	begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator. 
	Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door.

	GERARD

	Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.

				GERARD
		Kimble. Stop!

	But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.

	KIMBLE

	Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the 
	outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble 
	is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door 
	- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

	Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
	Gerard.

	Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - 
	but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,
	shoves a man out of his line of fire.

				GERARD
		Down. down. everybody down!

	With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the 
	opening...

	EXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

	... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like 
	in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks
	back over his shoulder at...

	Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and 
	clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

				GERARD
		Kimble. Stop!

	It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his 
	leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

	Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds.

	Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A 
	long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with 
	bullet holes, he sees...

	Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
	alive. He runs free.

				GERARD
		Open the doors!

	Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the 
	glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. 
	It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble 
	rush across the street and disappear into the parade.

	Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.

	But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations 
	outside. Blending in with the marchers.

	Kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning. He wears

	INT. BAR - MORNING

	The PHONE RINGS nine, ten times. As Kimble waits he looks 
	down at his list of five. The only name remaining is 
	Fredrick Sykes.

	He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus 
	shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
	parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
	across the seat and opens the door for him.

	He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, 
	he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a 
	handgun.

	Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.

	EXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING

	Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind 
	Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see 
	if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his 
	sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.

	INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

	No sound. Slowly he moves into...

	HALLWAY

	Moving first toward the living room. The apartment is 
	modest.

	He stops by a photograph of a teenage girl. Another is a 
	boy in football uniform. The next one is a man in a 
	police uniform. Kimble freezes.

		Look, a year ago some people came

		To throw us off his trail.

		Unless... What if you were a well

		your wife? How would you do it?

				BIGGS
		I'd hire a pro. Sight unseen.

				POOLE
		Set it up to look like a robbery 
		gone bad.

				RENFRO
		How would you find him? Look in the

				RENFRO
		Through a connection.

				POOLE
		Maybe through a company you did some 
		business with.

				BIGGS
		Like a pharmaceutical company. 
		Someone in security.

				NEWMAN
		On the night of his wife's murder, 
		Kimble attended a hospital benefit 
		sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor 
		Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company.

	Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board.

				BIGGS
		But Sykes claims he was out of town.

				POOLE
		And company records support that he 
		was on a business trip.

				RENFRO
		That's an easy fix. So let's say he 
		was in town. Did the job. Everything 
		goes as planned with one problem.

	  			NEWMAN
		Instead of looking like a robbery 
		gone bad, Kimble ends up being the 
		one accused...

				BIGGS
		... tried, convicted...

				POOLE
		... and the hit man gets away clean.

				RENFRO
		So Kimble returns to hunt for and 
		find the hit man.

		Why? To share the blame? He'd still 
		go to prison.

	Gerard moves to the board. He takes down a card.

	Kimble helps load the next sample.

				KIMBLE
		Half the people in the study were 
		indigents. No follow-up, no baseline 
		on them. Who could say they didn't 
		come into the study with bad livers?

				WAHLUND
		The one on the right is one of the 
		samples you sent me. It shows a lot 
		of perriportal inflammation loaded 
		with eosinophils. When you see that 
		with the accumulation of bile it's 
		a classic for -

				KIMBLE
		- drug induced hepatitis.

				WAHLUND
		I'm impressed. Now look at this.

	She positions a second slide.

				WAHLUND
		According to the study, this is a 
		slice from the same liver.

	Kimble studies the slide. The tissue difference is markedly 
	different, clearer.

				KIMBLE
		Cold normal.

				WAHLUND
		Clearly not from the same tissue. 
		In fact.

	She yields the microscope to Kimble.

				WAHLUND
		See this small area of bile duct 
		proliferation? Von Meyenberg's 
		Complex. Occurs in only 2% of the 
		population. But it's in every one 
		of your five samples.

	Kimble looks up.

				KIMBLE
		That's statistically impossible.

		told the guys on my service to call

				WAHLUND
		Big bucks. One schmuck standing in

				KIMBLE
		Why not? He's one of the original

		sent, replace them with healthy 
		samples, issue the path report on 
		the healthy stuff-piece of cake.

	Kimble notices something in the report.

				KIMBLE
		When did Lentz die?

				WAHLUND
		Oh, last summer sometime. August... 
		Why?

	Kimble looks up from the protocol report.

				KIMBLE
		Because a good third of the samples 
		Lentz approved were signed after he 
		died.

	Kathy comes to look at the report. Lentz's signature is 
	on reports dated October, November, December.

				KIMBLE
		Someone else used Lentz's name.

				WAHLUND
		A pathologist at Devlin-Macgregor?

				KIMBLE
		They wouldn't have had the access.

	booking photo stares back at him.

	Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns 
	the pages.

	The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back 
	to reading. A moment later he folds the paper back to the 
	front page.

	The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again,
	then down.

	Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, 
	stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the 
	rear cars.

	Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his 
	car to reach the station. He keeps his head turned until

	Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp. 
	Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble 
	in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on 
	throughout the car.

	Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and 
	aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and 
	almost smiles.

	SYKES
	Go ahead. You don't have it in you .

	For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the 
	gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. 
	Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, 
	driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost 
	unconscious.

	Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit 
	Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.

	Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the 
	Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the 
	Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop.

	He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face 
	off the floor.

		Not as easy as Helen, was it?

		You missed your stop.

	He moves to the front of the car with Sykes' and the Transit

		There is a U.S. Marshal out there. 
		Hold your fire!

	HELICOPTER'S POV

	FOLLOWING Kimble. Its beam tracking Kimble across the 
	rooftop. He moves through the blowers and duct work. 
	Kimble is gaining ground on Nichols.

	ON SHARPSHOOTER

	He is about to fire when he hears through his radio.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Hold your fire.

	The shooter pulls back.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard rushes across the roof toward Kimble.

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He is almost to the end of the roof when Kimble tackles 
	him. The two men crash against sloped glass roof of an 
	elevator housing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Inside the shaft - an elevator moves toward the roof. It 
	stops on the floor ten feet below the roof. THROUGH the 
	glass roof we see the doors open.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - GERARD - NIGHT

	Charges toward -

	KIMBLE

	Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED 
	GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.

	Nichols' head rocks from the impact.

	The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins 
	to drop.

	Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams 
	him down hard again.

	HELICOPTER

	Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and 
	Gerard closing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	The elevator doors close and the car beneath the 
	skylight begins to descend.

	GERARD

	Pulls up.

				GERARD
		Kimble!

	Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass 
	and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble 
	and Nichols into...

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft 
	and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. 
	Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble 
	hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping 
	himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An 
	elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the 
	shaft.

	GERARD'S POV

	Kimble's car disappears into the darkness.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR - NIGHT

	Nichols pulls himself to his feet. Hits the emergency 
	stop and the doors open. He disappears into...

	INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the 
	giant machines.

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
	carefully into the laundry.

	... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
	DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
	move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
	heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

	... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
	stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by 
	conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

	The NOISE is DEAFENING.

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		Where did the elevator stop?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	NEWMAN IN SECURITY

	Newman checks the computer board for the elevator 
	position.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		Level five.

	INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
	exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
	grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

	KIMBLE

	Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
	stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
	the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
	between the large conveyors.

	ANGLE - SORTING ROOM

	Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
	standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

				GERARD
		Get out of here.

	He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
	worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
	rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
	switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
	takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
	main room.

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		We're going in. Give me five 
		minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.

	He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main 
	room.

	INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

	He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

	He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
	dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
	him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

	Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
	voice from the other end of the laundry.

				GERARD (V.O.)
			(above the din)
		Kimble!

	Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
	where Gerard enters.

	ON GERARD

	The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

	They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
	up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
	move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
	equipment.

				GERARD
		... There is no way out of here.

	The building is locked down.

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
	the conveyor belts.

				GERARD (O.S.)
		Kimble... I know about Nichols. I 
		know about Sykes. Kimble stops.

	ON GERARD

				GERARD
		... Nichols borrowed your car the 
		night of the murder and called 
		Sykes from it.

	RENFRO

	Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
	comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
	dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

	KIMBLE

	Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
	Nichols.

	GERARD

	Moving through the forest of massive bags.

				GERARD
		... That's why there was no forced 
		entry at your house. He'd used your 
		keys.

	KIMBLE 

	Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

	NICHOLS

	Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
	killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
	chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
	hanging control for the I-beam.

	GERARD

	Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
	dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
	see straight back toward the washers. 

				GERARD
		Kimble... Come meet me out here.

	ON RENFRO

	He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
	under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
	WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
	rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
	opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

	NICHOLS

	Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
	shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
	Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

	GERARD

	Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor 
	belts. He makes one last appeal.

				GERARD
		It's time to quit running... if you 
		don't, you know I'll stop you. He 
		listens, there is no answer.

	KIMBLE

	Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
	shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

	GERARD

	Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
	pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
	on us...

	NICHOLS

	Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
	before he fires however he hears...

				KIMBLE (O.S.)
		Hey, Chuckles...

	Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
	and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
	behind Gerard.

	GERARD

	Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
	with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
	instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

	Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

	They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
	room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

	INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

	Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan 
	Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie 
	for space in front of the Hilton Towers.

	Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an 
	ambulance. The doors close.

	REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk 
	giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom. 
	We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them 
	TOWARD the entrance.

				T.V. NEWS REPORTER
		... As we reported a few minutes 
		ago, the saga of once-prominent 
		Chicago surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble, 
		who escaped from an Illinois 
		Corrections bus, took a strange
		twist this evening when Dr. Kimble 
		was captured at the Chicago Hilton...

	ANOTHER REPORTER continues:

				ANOTHER REPORTER
		... there are unconfirmed reports 
		from police of new evidence which 
		may exonerate Kimble while 
		implicating some of the biggest 
		names in medicine...

	The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of 
	photographs.

	A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the 
	ballroom:

				STUNNED DOCTOR
		He just walked in... We didn't know 
		what he was going to do. My wife 
		was very frightened... The next 
		thing I knew cops were charging in 
		and...

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole 
	and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos. 
	Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics.

	EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT

	As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights 
	flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd 
	forward, yelling questions.

				REPORTER
		Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove 
		your innocence!

	Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

				GERARD
			(to police)
		Get them back.

	The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into 
	a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back 
	door and helps Kimble inside.

				BIGGS
		Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.

	Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next 
	to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

				GERARD
			(to Poole)
		Poole, you got that thing?
			(to Kimble)
		Give me your hands.

	Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks 
	Kimble's handcuffs.

	Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the 
	pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

				GERARD
		Take care of those hands, Doc, 
		you're going to need them again 
		soon.

				KIMBLE
		I thought you told me 'you didn't 
		care.'

				GERARD
		Yeah, well, don't spread it around.

	They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

	HELICOPTER POV

	The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading 
	back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at 
	first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined 
	by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the 
	traffic, movement and lights of the city.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT

	CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

	Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

	EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT

	Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN 
	in tuxedo moves into:

	INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

	THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
	to the ballroom.

	ANGLE - COAT CHECK

	The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
	When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
	a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

	He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
	ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
	fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
	sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
	models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

	A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
	AID FOUNDATION"

	Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
	sets on another waiter's passing tray.

				ROBERTS (V.O.)
		Richard...

	DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
	of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

				ROBERTS
		Cancun. Nat just talked everybody 
		into it...

	A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

				KIMBLE 
		So, what's the deal? If the hospital 
		buys ten new -

				NAT
		No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
		Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
		has no ulterior motives.

				KIMBLE 
		On the house, huh?
			(to bartender)
		Tonic water with lime.

	Everyone agrees.

				KIMBLE 
		Never get me to sell my soul for one
		of those trips...

	His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

				KIMBLE
			(to Nat)
	 	... But if you get any more Bulls 
		tickets, Nat, give me a call.

	The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS

	Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary

	He keeps moving.

				GOLFING MAN 
		Thanks, Richard...

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT

	KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
	elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
	T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

				DR. WAHLUND 
			(dripping sarcasm)
		I'm so glad you talked me into 
		coming, Richard... I can pick my
		cruise wardrobe.

				RICHARD 
		It's for a good cause, Kath... 
		Besides you need to get out of the
		lab more. Your electron microscope
		is starting to give you a tan.

	She smiles. He moves on.

	ANGLE - PARTY

	Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

				KIMBLE
		Hey, Jim.

	DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
	University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I just saw someone who 
		wanted to meet you...

	Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
	wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
	a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
	catch a look and hold it.

				NICHOLS (V.O.)
		Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
		is working on the RDU90 trials for 
		Devlin-Macgregor.

	Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
	smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

				LENTZ
		Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
		trading phone calls last few days 
		... something about a biopsy report 
		I returned to you?

				KIMBLE
			(suddenly attentive)
		Yeah... Three. Livers appeared 
		hepatetic to me.

				LENTZ
		I'll be in my office in the morning 
		and I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
		a good time for you?

				KIMBLE
		Sure.

				LENTZ
			(holds Kimble's look, 
			then to Nichols)
		See you, Jim.

	Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
	on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
	Nichols move together through the party.

				NICHOLS
			(digs in his pocket)
		Before I forget, I went by the garage
		this afternoon and picket up the 
		Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

	He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

				KIMBLE
		They fix it this time?

				NICHOLS
		We'll see.

	They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
	Kimble kisses her.

				NICHOLS
		You look fabulous, Helen.

	He kisses Helen.

				HELEN (WOMAN)
		Hello, Jim.

				NICHOLS
			(to Kimble)
		We've got a court tomorrow at three.

	Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

				KIMBLE
		Well, I've seen everyone, can we 
		leave?

				HELEN
		That would be a little abrupt, don't 
		you think?

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT

	A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
	others at table ant sit across from each other.

	Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
	mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
	OLDER WIFE.

	Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
	her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
	CONTINUE...

	INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
	changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
	of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
	catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
	his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
	ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
	of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
	"not yet."

	As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

	"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
	at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
	"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
	you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
	'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

	Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
	watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
	her head.

				NOW EAU WIFE
			(to table)
		I told my husband that he was going 
		to kill us if he didn't stop 
		operating. What with this AIDS thing, 
		he's putting us all at risk.

	Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
	a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

				HELEN
			(to her dinner partners)
		I'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
		home.

	They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
	shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we 
	see Lentz watching.

	INT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
	his hair as he drives.

				HELEN
		You looked handsome tonight...

				KIMBLE
		Thank you...

	He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
	for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

				HELEN
		Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
		like waiters...

				KIMBLE
		But me?

				HELEN
		You looked more like... a band 
		director.

	He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
	changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

				HELEN
		Are we home yet?...

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his 
	PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.

			(to phone)
		Dr. Kimble
			(suddenly attentive)
		When? Okay, tell them I'll be there 
		in ten minutes.

	He hangs up.

				KIMBLE
		Tim's got a problem.

	Helen kisses him again, opens the door.

				HELEN
		Call me on your way home.

	CREDITS END as we -

	CUT TO:

	INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down 
	stairs to the OR hall.

	He sticks his head into the operating room.

				KIMBLE
		Cavalry's here.

	Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

	SCRUB ROOM

	Kimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring 
	him up to speed.

				RESIDENT
		Patient is a male, forty-three. We 
		pulled his gall bladder and the 
		bleeding started.

				KIMBLE
		What's his pro time?

				RESIDENT
			(concerned)
		He's at 36 seconds. We got a major 
		bleeder in here.

				KIMBLE
		You talk to the family?

				RESIDENT
		None. He's off the street.

	CUT TO:


	INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

	Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with 
	trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble 
	is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both 
	working so intently they never look at each other as they 
	talk...

				KIMBLE
			(to Anesthesiologist)
		Okay... I'm clamping. Can he 
		tolerate it?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		He's a very sick guy.

				KIMBLE
		Do we have a choice?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		Go for it.

				KIMBLE
		Marie, give me a clamp...

	MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble 
	and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident 
	assisting.

				KIMBLE
			(never looking up)
		Your husband know you're here tonight,
		Marie?... What about this liver?

				RESIDENT
		History's sketchy. Could be an 
		alcoholic.

				KIMBLE
		Who referred him?

				RESIDENT
		He's on a drug protocol. RDU90.

	Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident 
	over their masks, then back to work.

				KIMBLE
		The wave of the future... Marie, you 
		told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous 
		of this late night thing we've got 
		going here... This should hold him. 
		Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a 
		biopsy...
			(to circulating nurse)
		Send it downstairs and make sure you 
		get Kath her slice.

				SURGEON
		You staying for the closing, Rich?

	Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

				KIMBLE
		No. I got a date.

	INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind 
	him; it is the other Surgeon.

				SURGEON
		Hey, Richard...

	Kimble turns.

				SURGEON
		Thanks.

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Kimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home. 
	He is on phone, waits for answer.

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with 
	an afghan around her shoulders. She's been reading.

	Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the 
	stairs.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

	Kimble driving.

	INT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

	Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

	Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on 
	the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close 
	one of the interior closet doors.

	She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

	A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
	claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her 
	string of pearls bursts...

	... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls 
	across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from 
	the top.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the 
	driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still 
	on.

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on 
	the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and 
	calls up the stairs.

				KIMBLE
		I'm home. Did you hear who won the 
		Bulls game?

	No answer. He steps into the:

	KITCHEN

	The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The 
	WASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer,
	and STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two 
	glassesand leaves the kitchen.

	INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT

	Lies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of 
	phone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the 
	gun.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS - STAIRS - NIGHT

	Kimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Helen's hand reaches out presses the cradle down, dials

	ON KIMBLE

	Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops.

	A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks 
	it up... a pearl.

				KIMBLE
		Helen?

	Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. 
	Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

	UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

	Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
	he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
	Adrenal surge.

	Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
	free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
	The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
	leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
	sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
	landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
	hall below.

	SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

	The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
	catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
	shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

	Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
	Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
	face...

	The SIRENS are LOUDER...

	Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
	down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

	Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped 
	by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

				HELEN (O.S.)
		He's here... still in the house...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one 
	hand, her head with the other.

				911 (V.O.)
		Did I hear you right? Your attacker 
		is still in the house? Ma'am?

				HELEN
		He's trying to kill me...

	Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.

				911 (V.O.)
		Will you repeat that please?

				HELEN
			(to Kimble)
		Richard... He's trying to kill me... 
		my head.


	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly 
	to the house.

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she 
	was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her 
	leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

				KIMBLE
		Hang on, babe... going to be all 
		right.

	Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

				HELEN
		My head. Richard my hold me.

	Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her 
	head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes 
	she won't be all right.

	CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

				911 (V.O.)
		... Hello. You said his name is 
		Richard? Ma'am, can you talk to me? 
		Ma'am?

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The Cops enter the house. See the .38 lying on the floor. 
	Covering each other, they move quickly up the stairs - guns 
	drawn.

	Third floor. The First Cop, gun drawn, turns the corner of

		Move away from her.

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Kimble, numbed by the event, washes the blood off his hands 
	in the kitchen sink. A cop takes his blood-stained tux 
	jacket, and another hands him a parka.

	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious 
	neighbors, television news vans, etc.

	Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van 
	arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.

				DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
		Can you give us a little more to go 
		on besides the fact that he had an 
		artificial arm? What kind of gun was
		it, Doc?

	INT. 11TH STREET DISTRICT HOUSE - NIGHT

	CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" 
	shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: 
	KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, 
	aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

				KIMBLE
		It was .38... I think. I only saw it 
		for a second. I knocked it out of 
		his hand.

	As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the 
	murder scene being processed:

	FLASH - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Forensics technicians photograph the .38 at the base of the

				DETECTIVE ROSETTI (V.O.)

	DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
	Your wife was loaded wasn't she? I mean, she was worth quite 
	a bit of money.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems 
	to sense something aggressive in their questioning.

	They no longer seem on the same team.

				KIMBLE
		What's going on here? This guy was 
		trying to rob us.

	The two cops stare at Kimble.

				KIMBLE
		You guys have got to be out of your 
		minds. I didn't kill my wife!

	He gets up to go. A cop blocks his path. He turns and looks 
	at Kelly.

				DETECTIVE KELLY
		Let's start over, Dr. Kimble. What'd 
		you have for breakfast?

	CUT TO:

				KIMBLE
		I know what I saw, Walter.

				GUTHERIE
		I put you up on the stand to say what

		Look, Richard, you're paying us a

		I didn't kill my wife.

	INT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - DAY

	Kimble being escorted back to the courtroom. A guard carries

	INT. COOK COUNTY LOCKUP / CHANGE ROOM - DAY

	On the other side of the door is the courtroom. A sheriff's

		It's a circumstantial case, but it's

	KIBLE'S POV - THE JURY

	A few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken 
	out of context.

	NICHOLS ON THE STAND

				PROSECUTOR
		Dr. Nichols. You are aware that 
		Richard Kimble was the only 
		beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate.
		12 million dollars roughly.

				NICHOLS
		I was aware of that. The money meant 
		nothing to him.

				PROSECUTOR
		Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
		once said that 'if he had Helen's 
		money he could find plenty of uses.'
		Did he not?

				NICHOLS
		We were talking about -

				PROSECUTOR
		Yes or no?

	Nichols' look tells us everything... Yes.

	CUT TO:

	CORONER

	On the stand.

				CORONER
		The wound to the head caused a 
		massive hemorrhage to the brain. It 
		took from five to seven minutes for 
		her to die...

	A woman in the jury reacts. Kimble notices.

	KIMBLE

	On the stand. He finishes his moving description of the 
	events. We see some of the jury has been moved.

				KIMBLE
		... And I was holding her when the 
		officers came in.

	Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the 
	jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

				PROSECUTOR
		How tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?

				KIMBLE
		I can't be sure. We were, mostly on 
		the floor, fighting... I couldn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Did that fight cause the scratches 
		on your face and arms?

				KIMBLE
		No. As I explained -

				PROSECUTOR
		And how did this man enter your 
		house?

				KIMBLE
		I don't know -

				PROSECUTOR
		And you probably don't know why your 
		wife told the emergency operator You 
		were her attacker?

				KIMBLE
		She didn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Your name is Richard, isn't it? Your 
		gun is a .38, isn't it? Your prints 
		were on the gun, the bullets, the 
		lamp, her neck, weren't they?

				KIMBLE
		Look...

				PROSECUTOR
		Weren't they?

	CUT TO:

	INT. COURTROOM - DAY

	Richard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a 
	shadow of the man we knew before, stares ahead passively as 
	Judge Bennett delivers the sentencing to hushed courtroom.

				JUDGE BENNETT
		After careful and studied review of 
		all evidence presented during each 
		phase of this proceeding, and 
		because aggravated circumstances, 
		detailed at length, were present 
		the night of January 20th.

	Kimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence 
	shockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear 
	doors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's 
	satisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, 
	lowers his head. Disbelief.

	ANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE

	He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by 
	bailiff. Gutherie whispers an "I'm sorry." Kimble doesn't 
	hear it.

				JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
		Therefore, it is the decision of 
		this court...

	Looks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom. Faces 
	stare back.

	INT. KIT ROOM - DAY

	Judge Bennett's V.O. CONTINUES over:

	CLOSE ON CUFFS

	Slapped down over wrists, ratcheting down tight.

	Ankle cuffs dragged out. Pant legs raised, canvas shoes

	CHAINS RATTLED out. Snaked across the floor. Looped around 
	waists and locked to handcuffs to form belly chains.

	EXT . SALLY PORT (COOK COW TY JAIL) - NIGHT

	The chain gang exits through the sally port. Kimble and

	EXT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

	Main gates open. The BUS GRINDS onto the streets.

	INT. BUS - DAY

	The four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer 
	chained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing...

	The two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG 
	GUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns 
	bouncing on their knees. Prisoner #l shifts his gaze to...

	The driver. Pistol on his hip.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging:

				PRISONER #1
		Hey. Illinois penal regulations 
		require a meal for transport
		rides of four hours or more.

	Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
	Checks his watch: 4:00.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Jack! Feedin' time.

	Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
	belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

	PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
	the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
	aisle...

	PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
	between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
	CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
	plastic shank.

	Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
	handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
	a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

				COPELAND
		Breathe, and you're first.

	Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
	carelessly ready.

	Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
	doesn't respond.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Suit yourself.

	He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
	sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

	Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

				KIMBLE
		Look out!

	Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
	Young Guard's gut.

	Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
	out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

	Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
	floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
	inside, but...

	Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
	Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under
	the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

	The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard.

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	As the bus careens off the road, accelerating.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing
	prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard.

	Old Guard shotgun-butts Prisoner #1, flips the gun, PUMPS 
	ONE ROUND into the man's chest. Dead. He turns just as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat.

	Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the 
	Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes 
	off target as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
	and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the 
	bottom of a small ravine.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

	On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
	him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
	at...

	Kimble. Rising between the seats.

	A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
	off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

	Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
	find Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
			(to Kimble)
		You. You're a doctor. C'mere.

	He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
	medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

				OLD GUARD
		Do something.

	Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
	his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
	Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
	Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

				KIMBLE
		He isn't going to make it unless he 
		gets to a hospital. Fast.

				OLD GUARD
		ZL.

	In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it 
	just settling?

	With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
	Guard's bleeding.

	ANGLE UNDER SEAT

	We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
	back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the 
	opening.

	BACK TO KIMBLE

	A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
	retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
	growing vibration.

				KIMBLE
		Just where the hell are we?

	The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
	looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

				OLD GUARD
		Oh, shit...


	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
	grows bright by the light of an approaching train.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges 
	to his side.

				KIMBLE
		It's locked. Where're your keys?

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young 
	Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles 
	the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

	The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
	snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

				KIMBLE
		Which one? This? This one?!

	Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
	the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

				KIMBLE
		Help me get him -

	But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out 
	the shattered windshield.

	ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS

	Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...

	EXT. BUS - NIGHT

	... and hits the ground running the other way. The 
	locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should 
	Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard 
	hold a look.

	EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT

	As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard 
	behind him. He slings the man clear.

	SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

	For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

	The train light X-rays him.

	Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
	away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
	dozen mincing steps before...

	IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
	splitting it open.

	Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
	feet, still running feverish half-steps.

	An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
	flanks.

	The train burns past the wounded Guard.

	Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
	him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

	Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
	after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
	chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

	The train burrows to a stop.

	Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
	of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
	nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
	something in his hand.

	It's the key-ring.

	EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. 
	Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		Give me that.

	Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
	own chains.

				COPELAND
		You listen to me. I don't give a 
		damn which way you go, just don't 
		follow me.

	Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his 
	arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the 
	other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT

	News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing 
	smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines 
	hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work 
	feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled 
	wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation 
	investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted 
	remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

	Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. 
	marshals emerge:

	BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick 
	shithouse.

	RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds 
	fully-equipped.

	POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during 
	nut-cuttin' time.

	NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

	From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media 
	spectacle.

				GERARD
		Good lord...

				REFRO
		What is this... a circus?

	As a group they begin moving along the service road above 
	the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below 
	them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they 
	walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

	Biggs spots something...

				BIGGS
		Point of impact.

	... and branches off.

				GERARD
		Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.

				BIGGS
		Shit.
			(to Newman)
		Come on.

	They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain 
	with Gerard.

	A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he
	sees Gerard's Marshall star.

				GERARD
		How ya doing? Who's in charge?

				TROOPER
		Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the 
		lights -

	Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the 
	scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

	Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
	about to happen.

	ANGLE - OLD GUARD

	Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
	shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
	SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote 
	news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the 
	b.g., listening.

				OLD GUARD
		... train was bearin' down on us, 
		fast. I don't know how - it's still 
		kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
		and pushed him out of the bus.

				SHERIFF
		You coulda both been killed.

				OLD GUARD
		I know, but hell, he's my partner.
		Woulda done the same for me.

	The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard 
	eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

				GERARD
		Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy 
		U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.

				SHERIFF
			(annoyed)
		I'll be with you in a minute.

	The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
	his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos 
	of all four prisoners.

				SHERIFF
			(to Old Guard)
		For the record. These three dead. 
		And this one...

	He switches to a photo of Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
		Well, everything happened so fast...
			(bites lip, decides)
		Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

	Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred 
	prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

				SHERIFF
		You get some rest.

	He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

				SHERIFF
		Looks like you came a long way for 
		nothing. My men've already done a 
		thorough search from point of 
		impact and found nothing.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	ANGLE - CULVERT

	Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees 
	something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

	GERARD

	Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

				GERARD
		With all due respect, may I suggest 
		check-points starting at a 15-mile 
		radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east 
		of -

				SHERIFF
		Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? 
		Prisoners are all dead. The only 
		thing check-points will do is get a 
		lot of good people out here frantic 
		and flood my office with calls.

	Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and 
	we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

				GERARD
			(beat)
		Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for 
		that to happen... So, I'll be 
		taking over the investigation.

				SHERIFF
		On whose authority?

				GERARD
		By authority of the Governor of the 
		State of Illinois and the office of
		the United States Marshal, 5th 
		District Northern Illinois...

	Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents 
	from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

				SHERIFF
			(back-down beat)
		Okay. You want jurisdiction over 
		this mess, you got it.
			(to assistants)
		Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
		mop up for us.

	He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
	Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
	manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

	Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
	a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

				GERARD
		Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
		back and give this poor man some 
		room.

	Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a 
	change of story and command.

	Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the 
	Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

				GERARD
			(friendly, to Old 
			Guard)
		Always an interesting thing when we 
		find leg irons and no legs in them 
		who held the keys, sir?

				OLD GUARD
		Uh, me.

				GERARD
		Would you be so kind as to show them
		to me, sir?

	Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

	The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the 
	press hovering just out of earshot.

				GERARD
		Second chance.

	Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

	The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

				OLD GUARD
			(cracking)
		He mighta got out.

				GERARD
		Thank you.

				SHERIFF
		What the hell is this? A minute ago 
		you tell me he's part of the 
		wreckage, now you're -

				GERARD
		Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want 
		an accurate body count. Poole - Set 
		up operations right here.

	He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving 
	downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like 
	Israelites behind Moses.

				GERARD
		Ladies and gentlemen... our 
		fugitive's been on the run for 
		ninety minutes. Average foot speed 
		over uneven ground - barring injury 
		is approximately four miles an hour, 
		giving us a radius of six miles. I 
		want a hard-target search of any 
		residence, gas station, farmhouse, 
		henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in 
		that area. Check-points go up at 
		15 miles.
			(to media)
		You got that? Good. Now, turn 
		those damn things off and get out 
		of our way.

	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a
	dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

	EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

	Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. 
	The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment 
	later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

	EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with 
	blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's 
	going to need stitches.

	Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps 
	moving.

	EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN

	Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction 
	of the lights.

	A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the 
	road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 
	mile.

	ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM

	Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
	nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
	He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
	jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
	breath.

	Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
	the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
	cover behind the wrecked car.

	The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
	seat and closes the door.

	He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
	something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
	and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the 
	coveralls missing from the seat.

	As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
	side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
	clutching the coveralls.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN

	A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the 
	crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone 
	lines are pulled down from the lines running along the 
	tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

	Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and 
	relays it to Gerard.

				POOLE
		Blood trail found. Two miles 
		southwest.

				GERARD
			(to Biggs)
		Type it and match it against all 
		four prisoners.
			(to Renfro)
		Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to 
		every local hospital.
			(to Newman)
		Newman...

	Newman appears.

				NEWMAN
		Yes, sir...

				GERARD
		I need some coffee.

	As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING 
	from the train crash.

	ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH

	A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

				WORKER
		Hey, one's alive!

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

	Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food 
	outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck 
	operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. 
	Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

	A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a 
	bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us.
	Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front 
	of the doorway.

	KIMBLE'S POV - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM

	CUT TO:

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble closes the door and locks it. Hanging on the back of 
	the door we see a doctor's white coat.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

	An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside.

	CUT TO:

	CLOTH-COVERED INSTRUMENT TRAY

	On it we see: A packaged sterilized bandage, an opened 
	antiseptic wash, an opened topical anesthetic, and an empty 
	syringe. We PULL BACK to find:

	KIMBLE

	His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches 
	already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as 
	he sutures himself.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LONG SHOT (MOS) - MORNING

	At far end of the hall we see a STATE TROPER chatting with a 
	DUTY NURSE at a nurses' station.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROCEDURE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot 
	of antibiotics.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY

	A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes 
	closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.

	KIMBLE
	Can you hear me, sir?

	No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the 
	patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his 
	clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched 
	breakfast tray.

	CUT TO:

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - NURSES' DUTY STATION - DAY

	The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins 
	coming through on DESK FAX.

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble dressing in the man's clothes. He eats a piece of 
	toast - part of the man's breakfast - as he buttons up his 
	shirt.

	ANGLE - PATIENT

	His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call 
	button.

	CUT TO:

	INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

	A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the 
	duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the 
	patient's call light comes on.

	The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the 
	patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the 
	patient's room.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the 
	patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

				DUTY NURSE (O.S.)
		Mr. Patterson, do you need some more 
		water?

	ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST

	The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.

				DUTY NURSE
		... Oh, you did a good job on this.

	She takes his empty plastic pitcher and...

	... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and 
	refills the pitcher from the sink.

				DUTY NURSE
			(over her shoulder, 
			to patient)
		... It does get dry in here, doesn't 
		it?

	She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes 
	into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind 
	it.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and 
	a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency 
	room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the 
	E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts 
	down the corridor toward Kimble.

	The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

				TROOPER
		'Scuse me, Doc?...

	Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. 
	doors behind him.

				TROOPER
		... Don't know if you heard or not 
		but we're looking for an escaped 
		prisoner from that bus train wreck 
		'couple hours ago. Thought he might 
		show up here if he was hurt.

				KIMBLE
		What's he look like?

	The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow 
	trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down 
	Kimble's cheek.

				TROOPER
			(from fax sheet)
		Approximately six one, 180 pounds, 
		brown hair, brown eyes and beard.

	At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes 
	it clean as the Trooper looks up.

				TROOPER
		... Seen anyone that fits that 
		description?

				KIMBLE
		Every time I look in the mirror ...
		but without the beard.

	They laugh.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me...

				TROOPER
		Sure.

	Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks 
	outside...

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY

	Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The 
	lead wheels are stuck.

				KIMBLE
		Here...

	Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney 
	comes free.

				PARAMEDIC #2
		Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out 
		from under a train.

	As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face 
	of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

				YOUNG GUARD
		It's him... It's -

	Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young 
	Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

				KIMBLE
		How is he?

	The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

				PARAMEDIC #1
		He's pretty bad off. Broken leg, 
		ribs. Concussion.

	As Kimble moves away...

				KIMBLE
		Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got 
		a perforated spleen.

	He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk 
	the Young Guard inside.

				PARAMEDIC #2
			(impressed)
		Jesus, how could he tell that from 
		looking at his face?

	ANGLE - AMBULANCE

	Kimble climbs behind the wheel.

	EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	A full communications link is in place.

	Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information 
	to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole 
	calls Gerard.

				POOLE
		Background just came in from 
		Chicago.

				GERARD
		Hit me.

	Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of 
	information comes clear and fast.

				RENFRO
		Richard David Kimble. Vascular 
		Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree 
		murder in the killing of his wife. 
		Pleaded innocent. Claimed a 
		one-armed -

				GERARD
		Let's not retry the case. Priors
		and accomplices?

	Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the 
	investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.

				RENFRO
		None. No previous arrests.

	Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard 
	unzips his fly and relieves himself.

				GERARD
		Sealed juvie record?

	Poole calls out from behind tree.

				POOLE
		Nothing. Total cherry.

				GERARD
		Relatives? Children?

				RENFRO
		No relatives.

				POOLE
		One child. A son. Died in drowning 
		accident three years ago.

				GERARD
		Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends? 
		Combinations of the above?

				POOLE
		Lot of friends. Doctors. Hospital 
		staff.

	Gerard zips up.

				GERARD
		Start there. Authorize taps. Cover
		his lawyer first.

				RENFRO
		Never get it.

				GERARD
		Bet me.

	Renfro won't take it.

				GERARD
		Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, 
		he'll sign 'em.

	... Biggs charges up the hillside.

				BIGGS
		DeLange Hospital. Wounded guard 
		swears to High Holy he saw Kimble 
		right there in the hallway. 
		Ambulance, missing too.

	ANGLE - SITUATION TENT

	Gerard moves quickly to the map.

				GERARD
		Give me a time.

				BIGGS
		O-nine-thirty. Twenty minutes ago.

	Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we 
	covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn, 
	tightened, with the hospital as its center. The 
	triangulation is set.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. RURAL RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

	The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad 
	crossing.

				COP (V.O.)
		... We're waiting up here in Canton.
		Wondering if you heard anything on 
		this Kimble chase -

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad 
	crossing. The biocom monitors police chatter:

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		Two-twelve-A, be advised that all 
		discussion on this matter is to be 
		conducted on a tactical frequency 
		- either Channel K or Z. Over.

	Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield:

	ROAD SIGN

	An arrow points toward Canton, two miles.

	The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal 
	suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops 
	the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and 
	heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets 
	attention.

	INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

	Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and 
	reaches for his C.B. radio.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

	Poole hangs up phone.

				POOLE
		Ambulance just spotted two miles 
		west of Doverville. Heading north 
		on State road 53.

	Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much 
	smaller.

				RENFRO
		Running outta map, Sam.

	The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is 
	ready to move.

				GERARD
		Just the way we want it. Okay, 
		people, let's button up.

	They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and 
	eyeballs folded roadmap...

	EXT. SECONDARY ROAD (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the 
	Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.

	EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and 
	G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of 
	Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS 
	overhead.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance. 
	Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain.

				PILOT
			(into radio)
		We've got a visual...
			(to Gerard)
		He's heading toward the viaduct.

				GERARD
		Seal it up.

	EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY

	The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred 
	feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.

	The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into 
	the tunnel.

	ON KIMBLE

	Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at 
	the mouth of the tunnel.

	Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.

	ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)

	Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far 
	entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.

	ANGLE HELICOPTER

	Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.

	KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE

	Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. 
	Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.

	EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking 
	the other end.

	Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a 
	State patrol car blares:

				P.A. (V.O.)
		Please remain in your vehicles and 
		lock your doors. Repeat, please 
		remain in -

	ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

	Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar. 
	They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a 
	vest.

				RENFRO
		Got him.

	Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.

				GERARD
		Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard 
		part's over.

	He starts into the tunnel.

				RENFRO
			(to radio)
		We're movin' in.

	INT. TUNNEL - DAY

	Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three 
	silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' 
	P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb 
	back inside and lock their doors.

	Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the 
	middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

	Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the 
	ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain 
	clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

	Running water.

	ON MARSHALS

	They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks 
	around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks 
	confused.

				POOLE
		Where'd he go?

	Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until 
	he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.

				GERARD
		Biggs, Renfro with me.

	INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows 
	at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. 
	A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips 
	off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues 
	straight ahead.

	Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit
	wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong 
	to...

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the 
	forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

				GERARD
		Channel Three.

	They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go 
	left. Gerard - straight ahead.

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy 
	downslope.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Biggs and Renfro. Sweeping his light as he advances. 
	Searching for splash-patterns.

				BIGGS
			(into shoulder-mike)
		Nothing yet.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard. Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light. About to 
	pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the 
	branch-off tunnel. Hand marks?

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Got a possible here. Stand by.

	He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with 
	three limbs

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. 
	Slips again...

	... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

	Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. 
	Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
	lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
	there first.

	It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
	flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

				KIMBLE
		I didn't kill my wife.

				GERARD
		So, you didn't kill your wife.

	Not my problem.

	An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
	silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

				BIGGS (V.O.)
		Gerard? You there?

	Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

	Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up 
	piece.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro 
	appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...

				GERARD
		Straight ahead!

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance 
	in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead 
	lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is 
	incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and 
	stops.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam 
	disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of 
	mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

	He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.

	ANGLE - MARSHALS

	Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a 
	shooting stance.

				GERARD
		Turn around, hands over your head. 
		And get down on the ground.

	For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

				GERARD
		Your choice, Kimble...

	Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
	water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
	up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
	water toward Kimble.

				GERARD
		Get down on your knees.

	Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the 
	footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY

	Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap 
	into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into 
	the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

	INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY

	Renfro lowers his gun.

				RENFRO
			(amazed)
		Son of a bitch...

	It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

	ON GERARD

	He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He 
	stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him 
	something invaluable about this fugitive.

	EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY

	Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam 
	near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search 
	helicopter converge on the site.

	EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

	Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

	The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down 
	stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET

	Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the 
	shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

	Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

	FROM SHORE

	Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
	the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
	ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Running out of daylight, Inspector.

				GERARD
		Lights and generators are coming, 
		Captain.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Look, I don't mean to tell you your 
		job, but maybe one person in a 
		million could've survived that fall.
		The guy's fish food.

	Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

				GERARD
		Then find me the fish that ate him.

	He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

	EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

	Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a 
	sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, 
	exhausted.

	KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY

	Helen in bed. Kimble's hand comes INTO FRAME and touches 
	her shoulder. She turns toward Kimble as he moves INTO

		Good-bye. I love you.

	Again... Then again... then:

	HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. FOREST - MORNING

	Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He 
	remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.

	EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING

	Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into 
	tunnel.

	INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

	Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for 
	party 
	to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

	Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

	ANGLE - PHONE

	Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear 
	RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan 
		and Wainwright.

				KIMBLE
		Walter Gutherie please.

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left 
		for the day, would you like his 
		voice mail?

	Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front 
	of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the 
	shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he 
	sees the pharmacist looking at him.

	EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a 
	new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, 
	moves down the road to the diner.

	INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER 
	WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and 
	tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need to look at the menu?

				KIMBLE
		Some soup, please.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Good choice.

	She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around 
	Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

	A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
	stares at him.

	A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
	away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
	he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

	Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
	his soup. Where's the first waitress?

	Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
	sees:

	The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
	going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

	A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

	ANGLE - TV

	A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the 
	chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death 
	from the fall.

	Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on 
	the counter and exits.

	EXT. DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until 
	he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of 
	the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

	Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both 
	sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly 
	hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
	faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
	a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
	inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
	chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
	looks at himself. He's shaking.

	A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next 
	to him, passenger window rolls down...

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need a ride?

	Kimble stares at her.

				KIMBLE
		Which way are you going?

	She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. 
	They hold a look as we hear:

				RENFRO (V.O.)
		We feel confident about the I.D.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

	A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless 
	woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly 
	down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just 
	early morning traffic.

	We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the 
	street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
	that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
	woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
	radio.

				RENFRO
		Local officials were about to wet 
		their pants to move in.

				GERARD
		I bet they were.
			(to radio)
		Where's the woman?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	BIGGS

	In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

				RENFRO
			(into radio)
		Same room.

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and 
		Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. 
		I don't want anyone hurt. Stay 
		outside unless called. Radios on 
		three.

	The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his 
	service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.

				NEWMAN
		Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?

				GERARD
		Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
		Let's go.

	EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAWN

	DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of 
	the door.

				GERARD
		U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!

	INT. HOUSE - DAWN

	Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

	THEIR POV

	Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
	OF VIEW.

	A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

	GERARD

	Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
	room while he moves down the main hall into the back 
	bedroom.

	ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN

	Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
	off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
	He steps into -

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
	the bedroom.

	HALLWAY

	Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
	continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
	woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
	silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
	opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
	the doorway to the kitchen.

	Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
	He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
	Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

	CUT TO:

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
	didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

	COPELAND

	Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
	Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
	knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
	room.

	We...

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		I got your man! Now I want outta 
		here!

	Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
	woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
	fugitive.

	ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN

	Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
	through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

	LIVING ROOM

	Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
	his throat.

				COPELAND
			(to Gerard)
		You hear me? I said, I want out or 
		I'll cut your man's throat!

	GERARD

	Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
	at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

	LIVING ROOM

	Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
	hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

	Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
	whips Newman around and we see:

	A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
	late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

	He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
	The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
	stunned but unhurt.

	Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
	bedroom doorway.

				GERARD
		Shut up.

	She does. Immediately.

	EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

	As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
	the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
	sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
	hysterical, clutching his ear.

				NEWMAN
		My ear... I can't hear a thing out 
		of it. I can't believe you did that!

				GERARD
		You think I should have bargained 
		with him, don't you?

				NEWMAN
		Yes. You could've missed! You 
		could've killed me!

				GERARD
		Yeah, you're absolutely right. I 
		could've.

	They hold a look.

				GERARD
		How bad's your ear?

				NEWMAN
		Terrible. I probably have permanent 
		hearing damage.

				GERARD
		Let me see it.

	Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

				GERARD
		I don't bargain.

	Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
	unsettling man Gerard is.

	EXT. CHICAGO PAY PHONE - MORNING

	Kimble makes call. While he waits for phone to be answered 
	TRAINS COME and GO in the b.g. An EL CROSSES OVERHEAD. The 
	BELLS of Chicago River DRAWBRIDGE.

				KIMBLE
		Walter. It's Richard.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. LAW OFFICES OF GUTHERIE, MORGAN AND WAINWRIGHT - DAY

	Walter Gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking 
	Lake Michigan.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard... Jesus, why did you run? 
		Running only makes you look guilty.

				KIMBLE
		I wasn't worrying about appearances, 
		Walter.
	
				GUTHERIE
		Tell me where you are. I'll come
		meet you so you can turn yourself 
		in .

				KIMBLE
		I'm not turning myself in. I need 
		money.

	Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on 
	the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard. You're asking me to harbor
		and aid a convicted felon... I can't
		help you that way. My advice - both 
		as a friend and as your legal counsel 
		- is for you to give yourself up. 
		Now tell me... where are you?

	Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

				KIMBLE
			(beat)
		St. Louis.

				GUTHERIE
		Give me an address. I'll be -

	CLICK. Gutherie hears the LINE GO DEAD. Kimble's gone.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

	Kimble stands in the doorway with cup of coffee. He considers 
	his next move. Then seeing bank clock flash the time: 9:30 -
	he knows what that move is.

	INT. NORTH BANK TENNIS CLUB - DAY

	An upscale mid-town tennis club. Behind glass windows of 
	the entryway we see tennis courts. From the courts comes Dr. 
	Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his 
	tennis bag. A friendly DESK ATTENDANT Sharon) smiles as he 
	goes by.

				DESK ATTENDANT
		See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?

				NICHOLS
		Creature of habit, Sharon.

	EXT. NORTH BANK CLUB - DAY

	Dr. Nichols leaves the club. He tosses his gym bag into the 
	back of his car and drives off.

	INT. / EXT. NICHOLS'S CAR - DAY

	As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves 
	toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield. 
	Nichols waves the man off.

				NICHOLS
		Not today, please.

	The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his 
	passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

				NICHOLS
		No. Not -

	... then stops - the face at his passenger window is 
	Richard Kimble's.

				NICHOLS
			(stunned)
		Oh, my God... Richard...

	Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

				KIMBLE
		How're you doing, Charlie?

				NICHOLS
		You're alive...

				KIMBLE
		Yeah. And I need your help.

				NICHOLS
		Anything.

				KIMBLE
		I need some money. Whatever you've 
		got on you.

				NICHOLS
		Of course.
	
	Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs 
	for his wallet...

				NICHOLS
		Tell me where you're staying. I'll 
		get you more money. Some clothes. 
		Just give me an address...

				KIMBLE
		I'll call you.

	Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks 
	back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the 
	corner and come up the street behind them.

	Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to 
	Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

				NICHOLS
		I know why you came back - to find 
		him. If I can help, call me... 
		Call me.

	They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they 
	don't see it.

				KIMBLE
		Thanks, Charlie...

				NICHOLS
		Here, Richard, take my coat...

	He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car 
	behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview 
	mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

				COP
			(to Nichols)
		Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.

	Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

	INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

	REWINDING. The media room - just what it sounds like -
	banks of audio/video equipment and a sound board.

	Renfro rewinds the tape. Gerard, Biggs, Poole and Newman.

				POOLE
		We've alerted St. Louis P.D

				GERARD
		Call them back. Tell them you've 
		made a mistake.

				POOLE
		What?

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		Stop it there.

	Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

				GERARD
		Drop the voices.

	Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the 
	BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC, 
	MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the 
	sounds now.

				GERARD
			(he's heard something)
		Listen.

				BIGGS
		Trains? Traffic?

				GERARD
		More... there's a voice in the 
		background.

	At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING 
	MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop 
	Merchandise Mart."

				RENFRO
		That's an El announcement.

				GERARD
		And there's no E1 in St. Louis. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble
		is in Chicago. Poole, get his 
		artwork out to local police and have 
		C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, 
		bring in the detectives that handled 
		his case.

	Instantly the room is in movement.

				STEVENS
		I'll prepare the press release.

				GERARD
		No.

	Stevens stops.

				GERARD
		They don't know he's alive and as 
		far as Kimble knows we don't either. 
		I want to keep it that way as long 
		as we can. Are we clear?

	The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to 
	Kimble.

				RENFRO
			(for the group)
		Perfectly.

	Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.

				GERARD
		Noah... go to my office and let's 
		officially take Dr. Kimble out of

	down hallway and enters.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

	He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks 
	around. SEE BACK INTO the office area of the clinic. It

	But as Kimble turns to leave we see a PATIENT waiting to be 
	called. On his lap we see a prosthetic arm. Kimble looks up 
	from the arm to the man.

	the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping 
	bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces 
	of furniture.

	Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show 
	where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the 
	place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY

	Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning 
	supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation

	INT. POLICE WOMAN'S BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Kimble also at work at the bedside table. He carefully cuts 
	out his do-it-yourself photograph and places it over the

	of lamination plastic and trims the edges.

	Kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look, then 
	examines the finished product not bad.

	looks up like someone's bitten him. He, Biggs and Gerard are 
	in Nichols' administrative office. Gleaming. Filled with 
	awards and photos of Nichols and influential people. Nichols
	hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat. He 
	shows no sign of nervousness.

				NICHOLS
		He stopped me in my car. I gave him 
		some money.

				GERARD
		Where was this?

				NICHOLS
		Outside our tennis -
			(correcting himself)
		 - my tennis club.

	Gerard moves around Nichols' office taking in the details.

				GERARD
		Did he ask you for help?

				NICHOLS
		I volunteered. He wouldn't accept 
		it.

				GERARD
		Why do you think he came back to 
		Chicago?

				NICHOLS
		He didn't tell me.

				GERARD
		I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure
		he was trying to protect you from 
		having to lie for him.

	Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, 
	books, drawings, awards and photos.

				GERARD
		If you're really his friend, you'll 
		help us bring him in unharmed.

				NICHOLS
		Why, so he can go back to prison? 
		If you want help, gentlemen, you've 
		come to the wrong man.

	Gerard finds a photo of Nichols and a gleaming Ferrari.

				GERARD
		Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. 
		Marshals' office closed out 11,003 
		warrants... 10,975 of those were 
		captured. The twenty-eight others 
		thought they were smarter than

	He watches a technician leave the clinic and mops closer to 
	the doorway, and fails to see an attractive WOMAN DOCTOR 
	with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn 
	the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped 
	section.

	Head down, she is completely absorbed in a file and doesn't
	see the wet floor until she slips slightly, looks up but 
	keeps walking.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Where's Rudy?

				KIMBLE
		They said he's sick.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Didn't they tell you to put up the

				KIMBLE
		Uhhh. No they didn't.

		Asshole.

	Kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab.

	He moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms, 
	hands, legs hanging from the ceiling. Cables and electronic

	He leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the 
	Prosthetic Clinic. He passes a computer room and finally 
	reaches the office. He is about to enter when a woman's 
	voice stops him.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Hey, Ricky... Weren't you just in

	The elevator arrives. They step into:

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Anne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side.

				ANNE (WOMAN DOCTOR)
		Hey, how're you doing?

				KIMBLE
		Fine.

				ANNE
		You find that sign?

				KIMBLE
		Yes, I did.

				ANNE
		You called me an asshole.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me. I was having a bad 
		shift.

	They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.

				ANNE
		You worked at other hospitals?

				KIMBLE
		Lots of them over the years. Here, 
		long ago. Hasn't changed much.

				ANNE
		I bet it hasn't. See you.

	They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops 
	and watches him leave.

	INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

	Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking 
	at his information.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

	Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets 
	of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over 
	Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, 
	making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
	attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
	for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

	Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
	on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
	covers his face.

	Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
	Prosthetic Clinic material.

	FLASHBACK - FIGHT

	Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's 
	sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

	FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

	Reacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind 
	returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

	FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

	Escaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the 
	STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again.

	Another DOOR SLAMS, but this time the sound is distinctly 
	different... a CAR DOOR.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM (BACK TO PRESENT)

	Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert. 
	Listening, he hears: FOOTSTEPS are real, just outside and 
	MOVING TOWARD him.

	HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

	A car door slams. We see unmarked police cars pulling up in 
	front of the apartment. Cops are moving toward the house.

	INT. BASEMENT - DAY

	Kimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window. 
	Carefully looks out:

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving 
	his way.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

	He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees 
	the back courtyard covered by more cops.

	Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
	he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

	He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of 
	charging through the basement door they move up the front 
	steps and into the house overhead.

	Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

	KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS

	Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He 
	runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, 
	actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and
	pulled away.

	KIMBLE

	Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the 
	Punk Kid out to the car.

	POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.

	Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car. His 
	grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble leans against the wall, exhausted.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble carries his cleaning tray down busy hallway just 
	outside of the Prosthetic Clinic and stops.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Two cops talk outside the Prosthetic Clinic.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble backs to a safe place in the trauma hallway to wait 
	for them to leave.

	CUT TO:

	INT. 11TH STREET POLICE DISTRICT HOUSE - DETECTIVES ROOM - NIGHT

	The Punk Kid is handcuffed to a bench as a cop works on a 
	report. Suddenly the Kid notices something that gets his 
	attention.

	KID'S POV

	A wanted poster of Kimble over the cop's head.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The Kid sees - Wanted for Murder - realizes who it is.

				PUNK KID
			(to cop)
		Hey. Hey! I know that guy!

	The cop looks up, sees Kimble's poster and then back at the 
	Kid.

	CUT TO:

	INT. TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic. In passing through 
	the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing. 
	A major accident has happened, victims are being brought in.

	The P.A. CALLS for doctors. STATIC.

	ANGLE ON FAR END OF TRAUMA HALLWAY

	Elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients. 
	Some walk, some are helped by family and police. Nurses 
	direct traffic.

	Orders fly. Medicines are called. Family members yell for 
	doctors. Ask for the injured. Anne picks up the pace with 
	an ORDERLY wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient, 
	a BOY.

				ANNE
		What happened?

				ORDERLY
		A bus flipped off the overpass. Got
		at least twenty more coming in.

				ANNE
		What about this one here?

				ORDERLY
		Fractured sternum. X-ray's coming 
		up.

	Anne checks the boy's chart.

				ANNE
		Okay, we've got to get some room
		in this hallway, people.

	Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out
	of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.

				ANNE
		Hey, take this one up the hall to
		Critical Care.

	Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

	Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the 
	hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays.

	Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble 
	pushing the gurney and looking at the film.

	ANNE

	Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a 
	better look, but Kimble is gone. She goes back to work.

	ON KIMBLE

	He wheels the Boy's gurney into an elevator. The doors 
	close.

	INT. HOSPITAL - O.R. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Kimble wheels the gurney down the hall and stops the Boy 
	on the scrub threshold to the O.R. and stops a SURGEON.

				KIMBLE
		Hey. Hey!

	A Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the 
	gurney.

				KIMBLE
		They just sent this one up.

	He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and 
	yells to O.R. nurse.

				SURGEON
		Bob! Get this one into room four, 
		stat.

	He looks up, Kimble is gone.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The 
	Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman,
	sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the 
	glass-walled computer room and closes the door.

	He closes the blinds and turns on the computer.

	CUT TO:

	INT. CRITICAL CARE UNIT - NIGHT

	The crisis has wound down. Anne moves into the room and 
	begins checking patients. She stops a unit nurse, GLADYS.

				ANNE
		Gladys, where's the boy I sent down 
		with the janitor?

				GLADYS
		What boy?

				ANNE
		The one with the fractured sternum.

				GLADYS
		He never came in here.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble scans DOS files, each an eight-letter enigma. Finds 
	one with promise and loads it up.

				KIMBLE
		Wrong...

	He backs up and tries another file.

	"CLIENT DEMOGRAPHIC ORGANIZER SEARCH BY: AGE, SEX, RACE, 
	LIMB, OR OTHER?"

	Kimble knows he's got it.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT

	Kimble keys in these responses:

	"SEX: MALE"
	AGE: 35-50
	RACE: CAUCASIAN
	LIMB: RIGHT ARM
	OTHER: POINT OF REPLACEMENT: MID HUMERUS"

	INT. OPERATING ROOM WING - NIGHT

	Anne comes out of the stairwell and stops the Surgeon we 
	saw with Kimble.

				ANNE
		Dave, did you see a janitor come up 
		here earlier?

				SURGEON
		Yeah, he brought a kid up.
			(handing her the chart)
		Anne, did you write the orders? I 
		couldn't make out the signature...

				ANNE
		I saw -

				SURGEON
			(in a hurry now)
		Whoever did knew what the hell he 
		was doing. Kid's a hair away from 
		a ruptured aorta.

	He heads to the operating room, leaving her stunned. She 
	stares at the scrawled orders.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT

	A "PLEASE WAIT" message appears on the screen. We hear the 
	COMPUTER PROCESSING, searching, narrowing.

	The screen flashes:

	"NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CANDIDATES: 75
	DO YOU WISH TO SUBDIVIDE?"

				KIMBLE
		Seventy-five. Hell, yes.

	Kimble types in another defining characteristic... 
	Residence: Illinois.

	Again he waits. Rattles the blinds to make it seem like he's 
	cleaning. The list shortens.

	"NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CANDIDATES: 21"

				KIMBLE
		What else?

	MEMORY HIT - INT. CHICAGO COURTROOM - DAY

	Prosecutor stands before the jury.

	Kimble waits. Sixty-five names come up. Again too many. 
	Kimble's reached a dead end.

	Kimble thinks.

	Kimble fights the One-Armed Man. He wrenches the man's

	He moves it again. Harder, at an awkward angle.

	Kimble hits print. The MACHINE begins PRINTING. Kimble 
	looks up at the Prosthetic Clinic Technician - she is 
	listening to her headphones, can't hear the printer. He 
	continues to shake the blinds.

	EXT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC/TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble leaves Prosthetic Clinic and starts down the hall 
	for the exit when a voice stops him.

				ANNE (O.S.)
		Do you have a particular interest in
		our patients' x-rays?

	Kimble turns to see Anne coming toward him.

				KIMBLE
		What do you mean?

				ANNE
		I saw you looking at that boy's 
		chest film.

	She moves in on him. He eyes the exit.

				KIMBLE
		It's a hobby of mine -

				ANNE
		What other hobbies do you have? 
		Brain surgery?

				KIMBLE
	What do you want?

	She reaches him.

				ANNE
		I want to know how that kid ended 
		up in surgery.

				KIMBLE
		I'm a janitor. I did what I was 
		told.

				ANNE
		Bullshit. Who changed those orders?

	They hold a look. She knows. He takes a step back and she 
	pulls his I.D.

				ANNE
		You stand right here. I'm calling 
		security.

	Kimble runs. Anne turns to call security but doesn't.

	She stares after Kimble.

	CUT TO:

	INT. POLISH WOMAN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

	Kimble's room being searched by the marshals. Gerard finds 
	the flyer Kimble was handed on his way out the door. On it
	we see: COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL.

	CUT TO:

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - CLOSE ON KIMBLE'S I.D. - DAY

	Anne and Gerard stand in the hallway. Gerard studies the I.D.

				GERARD
		A man posing as a janitor orders an 
		emergency operation and all you do 
		is pull his I.D.?

				ANNE
			(firmly)
		A little boy's alive today because 
		he did something.

	Gerard watches her eyes carefully.

				GERARD
		So, you weren't aware that when he 
		escaped he was being transported to 
		Menard State Prison to begin a term 
		of life imprisonment.

				ANNE
		For what?

				GERARD
		For murdering his wife.

	Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her 
	surprise.

				GERARD
		Thank you for your help, Doctor.

	He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's 
	gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that 
	place. Renfro and the other deputies converge.

				RENFRO
		What I can't figure is, if you were 
		Kimble, why'd you take a major 
		league chance of hanging around a 
		trauma ward?

	Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices 
	something.

				RENFRO
		The place would be crawling with cops.

	Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and 
	follows the Man down the hall.

	The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the 
	Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, 
	holds the hallway door open for Gerard.

				MAN
		Can I help you find something?

				GERARD
		Thank you, sir, I think you already 
		have.

	We see the Man has a prosthetic arm and that they are outside 
	the door marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - MORNING

	Gerard and his deputies inside the Prosthetic Clinic.

	Artificial limbs are being tested, fitted. A technician

	Kimble waits for an elevator. It opens to reveal a pack of 
	staring COPS.

				ELEVATOR COP

		Comin' or not?

	Forcing his feet to move, Kimble boards...

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - ELEVATOR - DAY

	... and pivots quickly. Elevator rises. Floor-indicator moves 
	deathly slow.

	Kimble feels the breath of a dozen COPS on his neck. And just 
	when his floor is mercifully about to arrive...

	Overhead lights flicker, and the elevator jars to a stop 
	between floors.

				COPS
		Aw, shit... Not now... Anybody 
		bring a deck of cards?

	Abruptly they're moving again. Kimble's heart restarts with

	Kimble strides down the row of chairs, rounds the last

	Kimble exits the visitor's area. He sees another crowd of

	"STAIRS"

	Biggs and Gerard wait for the elevator. Finally Gerard's

	Kimble descending. Doors open and close throughout the

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims 
	shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.

	Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.

	One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the 
	shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the 
	stairwell railing to spy...

	Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be 
	any dark-haired man. But still...

				GERARD
		(a quick probe)
		Kimble.

	Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two 
	landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain 
	his step, keeps moving.

	But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's 
	stride told him everything.

				GERARD
		Kimble!

	Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

	Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby. 
	Sees two cops, quickly approaches.

				KIMBLE
		Officers - there's a man in the

		screaming.

	The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves
	toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak 
	himself in civilians.

	Biggs' elevator has finally arrived and emptied. He lets a

				GERARD
		U.S. Marshal! Get on the phone, call

		Go.

	He shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs.

	INT. LOBBY - DAY

	Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN 
	sounds.

	People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors 
	begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator. 
	Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door.

	GERARD

	Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.

				GERARD
		Kimble. Stop!

	But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.

	KIMBLE

	Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the 
	outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble 
	is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door 
	- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

	Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
	Gerard.

	Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - 
	but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,
	shoves a man out of his line of fire.

				GERARD
		Down. down. everybody down!

	With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the 
	opening...

	EXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

	... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like 
	in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks
	back over his shoulder at...

	Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and 
	clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

				GERARD
		Kimble. Stop!

	It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his 
	leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

	Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds.

	Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A 
	long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with 
	bullet holes, he sees...

	Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
	alive. He runs free.

				GERARD
		Open the doors!

	Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the 
	glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. 
	It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble 
	rush across the street and disappear into the parade.

	Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.

	But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations 
	outside. Blending in with the marchers.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOTEL - MORNING

	Kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning. He wears

	Inside the apartment the PHONE RINGS. No one is home.

	INT. BAR - MORNING

	The PHONE RINGS nine, ten times. As Kimble waits he looks 
	down at his list of five. The only name remaining is 
	Fredrick Sykes.

	He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus 
	shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
	parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
	across the seat and opens the door for him.

	He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, 
	he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a 
	handgun.

	Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.

	EXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING

	Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind 
	Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see 
	if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his 
	sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.

	INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

	No sound. Slowly he moves into...

	HALLWAY

	Moving first toward the living room. The apartment is

		Unless... What if you were a well

		Through a connection.

		Maybe through a company you did some

		Like a pharmaceutical company.

	Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board.

		But Sykes claims he was out of town.

				POOLE
		And company records support that he 
		was on a business trip.

				RENFRO
		That's an easy fix. So let's say he 
		was in town. Did the job. Everything

	  			NEWMAN
		Instead of looking like a robbery 
		gone bad, Kimble ends up being the

				HOST
		Tonight to close our conference, 
		we're honored to hear a report from 
		one of the most respected men in 
		his field...

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Kimble exits the hospital and moves toward Hospital E1 Station.

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	As the Host continues his introduction of the keynote speaker 
	we PAN the DAIS of distinguished medical men and women...

				HOST
		... He is the A. Jude Robinson 
		Fellow and Administrative Chief of 
		Pathology at Chicago Memorial 
		Hospital... and just recently has 
		been appointed member of the board 
		of directors for Devlin-Macgregor 
		Pharmaceuticals. Please welcome...

	... and STOP ON Charles Nichols.

				HOST
		... Dr. Charles Nichols.

	Nichols rises to applause and moves to the podium.

	EXT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL EL STATION - NIGHT

	Kimble starts up the stairs to the station just as a train 
	is coming in. Kimble moves down the platform and boards the 
	downtown train. Just before the doors close Sykes steps onto 
	the last car. The train moves out.

	CUT TO:

	INT. GERARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Gerard stares at his board. Stevens comes to the door.

				STEVENS
		I checked Sykes' calls for the last 
		two years against Kimble's like you 
		asked and found nothing.

				GERARD
		All right. It was a thought.

	He goes back to the board but Stevens isn't finished.

				STEVENS
		But when I cross-checked Kimble's 
		phone records... one came up.

	Gerard looks up.

				GERARD
		Kimble called Sykes.
			(calling)
		Renfro! Get C.P.D. to bring in Sykes!

				STEVENS
		Night of his wife's murder - 
		seven-thirty in the evening from 
		his car.

	Gerard stares at the deputy, thinking - something doesn't 
	click. Stevens sees the empty stare, then Gerard looks 
	back at his board.

				STEVENS
		I have the phone record right here.

				GERARD
			(calling)
		Poole! Bring me Kimble's arrest 
		report, now.
			(to Stevens)
		No, Stevens... I believe you.

	Poole enters with Kimble's arrest transcript. Gerard takes 
	the transcript as Renfro appears at the door.

				POOLE
		Sam, C.P.D. just checked Sykes' 
		apartment. He's not there.

	As Gerard looks up, we -

	CUT TO:

	INT. DOWNTOWN EL TRAIN - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

	Sits in the front car. There are very few other riders.

	A man with newspaper sits across the car reading. The 
	headlines facing Kimble say: "KIMBLE IN CHICAGO". Kimble's 
	booking photo stares back at him.

	Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns 
	the pages.

	The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back 
	to reading. A moment later he folds the paper back to the 
	front page.

	The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again,
	then down.

	Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, 
	stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the 
	rear cars.

	Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his 
	car to reach the station. He keeps his head turned until 
	the man is gone.

	ANGLE - THROUGH CENTER OF TRAIN - NIGHT

	From the center of Kimble's car we see the man with the 
	newspaper move up to a TRANSIT COP. They begin talking.

	Kimble stands, coming INTO the SHOT. We see him watching 
	the discussion.

	Suddenly a man, sitting in the rear of the car, stands 
	and blocks Kimble's view of the Cop. It's Sykes. His gun 
	is drawn.

				SYKES
		Back up. Move to the door, Doc.

	CUT TO:

	INT. TRAIN - TRANSIT COP'S CAR - NIGHT

	Transit Cop moves past the man with the newspaper toward 
	Kimble's car.

				TRANSIT COP
			(to radio)
		This is transit unit, 23. I have a 
		possible sighting of Richard Kimble. 
		Northbound coming into the Balbo 
		station. Request immediate back-up 
		at the station.

	He moves toward the connecting door to Kimble's car.

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	The train is not yet to the station. He has no escape. 
	Sykes moves toward him.

				SYKES
		This is my stop, Doc.

	Kimble stares hard at Sykes. He steps toward the side 
	exit.

				KIMBLE
		Good, it's my stop, too.

	Suddenly the door behind Sykes opens and the Transit Cop 
	enters.

				TRANSIT COP
		Kimble.
			(to Sykes)
		Sir, move away from him.

	Sykes - the gun tucked next to his side - turns.

	The Cop sees Sykes' gun, reacts...

	But Sykes FIRES first, shoots the cop FOUR TIMES.

	As the Cop falls, Sykes turns quickly to finish Kimble. 
	But Kimble pulls the emergency brake over the door.

	EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	The brakes lock. The TRAIN SCREECHES.

	INT. REAR CARS - NIGHT

	Passengers are thrown off their feet. Bags and briefcases 
	go flying.

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Sykes is thrown forward toward Kimble who holds onto a bar 
	for balance.

	EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	The train stops just short of the station. Only the first 
	two windows of the front car are over the platform.

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp. 
	Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble 
	in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on 
	throughout the car.

	Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and 
	aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and 
	almost smiles.

	SYKES
	Go ahead. You don't have it in you .

	For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the 
	gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. 
	Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, 
	driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost 
	unconscious.

	Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit 
	Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.

	Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the 
	Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the 
	Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop.

	He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face 
	off the floor.

				KIMBLE
		Not as easy as Helen, was it?
			(slams Sykes' head down, leaves)
		You missed your stop.

	He moves to the front of the car with Sykes' and the Transit 
	Cop's guns out. People back out of his way. He moves to 
	where the first two windows extend over the platform, kicks 
	out the front window and...

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

	... drops to the station platform. Kimble lowers his head and 
	moves down the uncrowded platform to the station.

	INT. GERARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The report comes off the scanner.

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		... units in the vicinity of Balbo 
		Street station. Be alert to possible 
		sighting of Richard Kimble...

	Gerard, Renfro and Poole trade looks. Gerard moves toward 
	the door.

				RENFRO
		Balbo station. That's -

				GERARD
			(cutting him off)
		Poole, get Biggs and Newman.

	They're gone as we -

	CUT TO:

	EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	Police cruisers pull outside the station.

	INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	As transit police move up the escalator to the platform, 
	Kimble moves unnoticed through the underground mall 
	beneath the hotel. Deposits the guns into a mail box and 
	keeps moving.

	INT. GERARD'S CAR - NIGHT

	Renfro driving, Gerard and Pool in car. Report comes over 
	the radio.

				POLICE DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		... all units in vicinity of Balbo 
		E1. Officer down. Repeat, officer 
		down. Man leaving scene with two 
		guns matches description of Richard 
		Kimble...

	Gerard looks out the window, he knows what this means.

				GERARD
			(quietly to himself)
		Damn...

	INT. HOTEL - MALL LEVEL / LOBBY - NIGHT

	Kimble moves up escalators from the underground station 
	into the Hilton.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Disheveled and driven, he moves from the escalators to the 
	lobby - checks the list of hospitality suites and sees 
	board which indicates Nichols speech in the rooftop 
	ballroom. He moves on to the main elevators.

	CUT TO:

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Nichols speaking. As he talks we MOVE TO...

	ANGLE ON TABLE OF MEN

	Listening - the same men we saw in the hospitality suite 
	when Nichols talked to Kimble. As we MOVE TIGHTER ON one 
	of the men, we notice his name tag says: Board of 
	Directors... Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

	INT. HILTON ROOFTOP ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Kimble rides alone to the rooftop ballroom.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	Gerard's car pulls up in front of the hotel. Police are 
	controlling pedestrians. Newman and Biggs, already decked 
	out in Kevlar, meet him.

				NEWMAN
		C.P.D. just reported -

				GERARD
		I heard. Was it Kimble?

				BIGGS
		Conflicting reports, but the cops 
		are considering him a shooter.

	Heavily-armed CPD units pull up. Gerard stares at the police 
	presence. He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is 
	conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain.

				POLICE CAPTAIN
		Witnesses say he entered hotel from 
		the subway.

				KELLY
		Okay. I want it locked down. Start 
		on the lower levels.

	The captain moves off. Gerard intercepts the cop.

				GERARD
		That's my man in there, Kelly.

				KELLY
		Not since he took down one of ours, 
		Gerard. This is a police matter,
		now. Stay, the hell, out of it.

	Kelly moves off. Gerard watches him a moment then he looks 
	up to the roof. Newman hands Gerard his belt with his 
	backup piece.

				GERARD
		C'mon, I know where he's going.

	He moves into the hotel with his deputies.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	LOCKDOWN MONTAGE - EXT. / INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	A) C.P.D. cruisers arriving. Cops deploying to points of 
	entry. Security guards keying shut parking garage and 
	blocking stairwells.

	B) Helicopter with police sharpshooters takes off from 
	Meigs Field downtown and heads for the hotel.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ROOFTOP ELEVATORS/PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble exits the elevators and moves down the corridor to 
	the ballroom. A man tries to stop him at the doors, Kimble 
	simply moves him out of the way and opens the doors to:

	CUT TO:

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Nichols moves to the last of his speech as Kimble enters 
	at the rear

				NICHOLS
		... And I especially would like to 
		thank my researchers who helped me...

	Nichols stops his speech - stunned to see Kimble.

				NICHOLS
		Richard...

				KIMBLE
		What's wrong, Charlie? Surprised?

	Kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of 
	doctors toward the podium.

	We see the faces of Kimble's colleagues and friends from 
	the ballroom sequence earlier. At first no one notices 
	Kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais, the 
	applause fades and then room quiets. Whispers of:

				CROWD
		It's Richard. It's Kimble.

	Stunned expressions.

	Kimble continues to the front, talking to Nichols as if 
	the room were empty.

				KIMBLE
		After Lentz died, you were the only 
		one that had access to the 
		pathology reports.

	Nichols remains calm.

				NICHOLS
		Reports? What are you?

				KIMBLE
		You switched the samples and 
		falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 
		could get approval.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I don't know what you're 
		talking about?...

				KIMBLE
		I have a set of the original 
		samples.

	Nichols stares at Kimble and for the first time we see a 
	flicker of concern.

				KIMBLE
		You almost pulled it off, Charlie. 
		But I know all about it now, and I 
		can prove it.

	Nichols and Kimble hold a look. Nichols turns to the audience.

				KIMBLE
		Ladies and gentlemen. My friend, as 
		you can see, is obviously not well. 
		Richard, if you want to talk -

				KIMBLE
		I didn't come here to talk

	Nichols leaves the dais and heads toward the exit.

	Kimble tracks along with him - moving through the tables - 
	passing the table with the Devlin-MacGregor board of 
	directors. They are disturbed by this situation.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moves through a door and exits into...

	HALLWAY

	Kimble follows moving through the tables and people to 
	reach the door.

	As soon as he's gone there are calls for "security." Doctors 
	move for the exits.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Gerard, Renfro, Newman, Biggs and Poole move into the lobby.
	Police move to cover the lower floors.

				BIGGS
		C.P.D. has the perimeter, hotel 
		security has the parking structure.

				GERARD
		Let them keep busy down below. 
		Newman, get with security. See if 
		you can locate Kimble from the 
		monitors. Keep in radio contact.

	Newman branches off to Hotel Security. The rest follow 
	Gerard to the rooftop elevators.

	EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARING over Chicago skyline. The bright red sign of the 
	Hilton Hotel looms ahead.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

	Nichols moves down hallway and turns into a hospitality 
	suite. A moment later Kimble follow and enters the...

	HOSPITALITY SUITE

	... and is immediately smashed with a chair by Nichols. 
	Kimble goes flying, stunned. Nichols locks the door.

				NICHOLS
		Your best quality, Richard, is that 
		you don't give up -

	Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet.

				NICHOLS
		... even when it's clearly in your 
		best interest to...

	He hits him again, drives him back into the library.

	Kimble tries to recover as Nichols relentlessly stays on 
	him. He pulls him up, slams him against the fire escape 
	doors.

				NICHOLS
		I always knew that I'd have to kill 
		you.

	He drives a blow into Kimble's stomach.

				NICHOLS
		Now, I must thank you for giving me 
		200 witnesses tonight who will 
		support me... when I tell them it 
		was self-defense...

	He shoves Kimble through the door out into...

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE BALCONY - NIGHT

	... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to 
	keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him, 
	but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks 
	Nichols back against the other side of fire escape.

				KIMBLE
		You missed your chance, Charlie...

	Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with 
	two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.

	Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a 
	security camera.

	CUT TO:

	INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

	A room lined with security monitors. Two security personnel 
	sit in front of their console. Newman stands behind them.

	On screen: We see Kimble moving down the stairs toward 
	Nichols, who pulls himself to his feet.

	Newman stands in front of the screen, talks to his radio.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		I've got Kimble on the roof with 
		Nichols. Southeast exit.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Gerard and deputies Poole, Biggs, and Renfro around him.

				BIGGS
			(to radio)
		Keep and eye on him. Biggs has roof plans.

				BIGGS
		There are four exits to the roof.

				GERARD
		I want them covered.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the 
	blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another 
	set of stairs to the roof.

				KIMBLE
		You took everything away from me... 
		for money.

	INT. BALLROOM ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor. The 
	elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented 
	doctors trying to escape. The marshals wade through, meet 
	up with two hotel security guards.

				GERARD
		This way.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by 
	the lights of the city skyline.

				KIMBLE
		I want to know, Charlie... was it 
		worth it...?

				NICHOLS
		This thing is bigger than even you 
		think, Richard. You can't stop it.

	He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him 
	against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the 
	street appears far below.

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom. 
	The deputies move to separate areas. Several doctors point 
	them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman stands in front the security monitors and watches 
	Kimble and Nichols on the roof.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the 
	HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits 
	the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter:

				VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.)
		Chicago police. Freeze.

	In the instant of shock, Nichols knees Kimble and bolts.

	INTERCUT:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

	Gerard moves down connecting hallway where a couple of 
	concerned doctors are trying to open the door to the 
	hospitality suite.

				GERARD
			(to doctors)
		Clear the hallway.
			(to security)
		Get that door open.

	The door opens and Gerard moves quickly through the 
	hospitality suite for the rooftop.

				GERARD
			(to security)
		Stay at this door.

	He moves through the door to the roof alone.

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman watching the security monitors sees Kimble and 
	Nichols. On another monitor we see Gerard exit the suite.

	EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

	Nichols runs.

	Kimble recovers, sees Gerard moving down the fire escape 
	toward him, and Nichols escaping. He goes after Nichols.

	The helicopter circles back over the roof, illuminating the 
	rooftop in its million-candle-power beam.

				HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
		I've got a visual on Kimble. He's 
		running.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Kelly listens on his ratio.

				KELLY
		Bring him down.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble chases Nichols down the roof as BULLETS from the 
	helicopter rip into the air conditioning duct next to Kimble.

	The helicopter swings out to keep Kimble in sight.

	ON GERARD

	Gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		This is a United States Marshal. 
		Get that helicopter out of here!

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He moves away among the duct work.

	Kimble follows.

	Gerard continues after Kimble.

	The helicopter circles and follows from above.

	INT. PENTHOUSE / DOOR TO ROOF - NIGHT

	Renfro triggers his radio.

				RENFRO
		There is a U.S. Marshal out there. 
		Hold your fire!

	HELICOPTER'S POV

	FOLLOWING Kimble. Its beam tracking Kimble across the 
	rooftop. He moves through the blowers and duct work. 
	Kimble is gaining ground on Nichols.

	ON SHARPSHOOTER

	He is about to fire when he hears through his radio.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Hold your fire.

	The shooter pulls back.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard rushes across the roof toward Kimble.

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He is almost to the end of the roof when Kimble tackles 
	him. The two men crash against sloped glass roof of an 
	elevator housing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Inside the shaft - an elevator moves toward the roof. It 
	stops on the floor ten feet below the roof. THROUGH the 
	glass roof we see the doors open.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - GERARD - NIGHT

	Charges toward -

	KIMBLE

	Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED 
	GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.

	Nichols' head rocks from the impact.

	The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins 
	to drop.

	Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams 
	him down hard again.

	HELICOPTER

	Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and 
	Gerard closing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	The elevator doors close and the car beneath the 
	skylight begins to descend.

	GERARD

	Pulls up.

				GERARD
		Kimble!

	Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass 
	and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble 
	and Nichols into...

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft 
	and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. 
	Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble 
	hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping 
	himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An 
	elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the 
	shaft.

	GERARD'S POV

	Kimble's car disappears into the darkness.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR - NIGHT

	Nichols pulls himself to his feet. Hits the emergency 
	stop and the doors open. He disappears into...

	INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the 
	giant machines.

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
	carefully into the laundry.

	... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
	DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
	move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
	heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

	... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
	stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by 
	conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

	The NOISE is DEAFENING.

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		Where did the elevator stop?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	NEWMAN IN SECURITY

	Newman checks the computer board for the elevator 
	position.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		Level five.

	INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
	exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
	grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

	KIMBLE

	Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
	stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
	the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
	between the large conveyors.

	ANGLE - SORTING ROOM

	Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
	standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

				GERARD
		Get out of here.

	He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
	worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
	rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
	switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
	takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
	main room.

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		We're going in. Give me five 
		minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.

	He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main 
	room.

	INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

	He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

	He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
	dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
	him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

	Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
	voice from the other end of the laundry.

				GERARD (V.O.)
			(above the din)
		Kimble!

	Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
	where Gerard enters.

	ON GERARD

	The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

	They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
	up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
	move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
	equipment.

				GERARD
		... There is no way out of here.

	The building is locked down.

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
	the conveyor belts.

				GERARD (O.S.)
		Kimble... I know about Nichols. I 
		know about Sykes. Kimble stops.

	ON GERARD

				GERARD
		... Nichols borrowed your car the 
		night of the murder and called 
		Sykes from it.

	RENFRO

	Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
	comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
	dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

	KIMBLE

	Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
	Nichols.

	GERARD

	Moving through the forest of massive bags.

				GERARD
		... That's why there was no forced 
		entry at your house. He'd used your 
		keys.

	KIMBLE 

	Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

	NICHOLS

	Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
	killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
	chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
	hanging control for the I-beam.

	GERARD

	Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
	dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
	see straight back toward the washers. 

				GERARD
		Kimble... Come meet me out here.

	ON RENFRO

	He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
	under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
	WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
	rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
	opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

	NICHOLS

	Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
	shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
	Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

	GERARD

	Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor

				GERARD
		It's time to quit running... if you 
		don't, you know I'll stop you. He 
		listens, there is no answer.

	KIMBLE

	Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
	shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

	GERARD

	Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
	pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
	on us...

	NICHOLS

	Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
	before he fires however he hears...

				KIMBLE (O.S.)
		Hey, Chuckles...

	Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
	and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
	behind Gerard.

	GERARD

	Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
	with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
	instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

	Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

	They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
	room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

	INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

	Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie

	Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an 
	ambulance. The doors close.

	REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk

	forward, yelling questions.

				REPORTER
		Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove 
		your innocence!

	Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

				GERARD
			(to police)
		Get them back.

	The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into 
	a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back 
	door and helps Kimble inside.

				BIGGS
		Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.

	Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next 
	to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

				GERARD
			(to Poole)
		Poole, you got that thing?
			(to Kimble)
		Give me your hands.

	Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks 
	Kimble's handcuffs.

	Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the 
	pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

				GERARD
		Take care of those hands, Doc,

		Yeah, well, don't spread it around.

	They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

          -- GENERAL CLAYTON "HAWK" ABERNATHY

          EXT. THE BASTILLE - PARIS - NIGHT

          A HEAVY NIGHT MIST swirls around the imposing stone walls of
          the Bastille. PRISON GUARDS patrol outside with their pikes
          as the SCREAMS OF PRISONERS echo out the barred windows.

          SUPER: PARIS, 1641

          INT. PRISON BLOCK - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT

          A pair of huge PRISON GUARDS walk down a row of filthy prison
          cells. Whimpering, starving PRISONERS appear and disappear in
          the flickering light of the wall torches. A large rat nibbles
          some stale bread in the corner, watching the guards.
          Finally, the two guards reach a cell whose PRISONER is not at
          all whimpering or starving. A huge Scotsman with a proud
          defiance in his eyes, a RED SQUARE MEDALLION dangling around
          his neck, glares through the bars. This is JAMES McCULLEN.
          The guards unlock his cell door, MATCHLOCK MUSKETS at the
          ready. McCullen stares at the muskets, unimpressed. He speaks
          with a thick Scottish brogue.

          MCCULLEN
          Still using matchlocks, are ya? I
          can get you a pair of flintlocks,
          you let me sneak out of here.
          Everyone else in this sequence speaks with a French accent.

          GUARD #1

          (TEMPTED)
          Good ones?
          The other Guard glares at him. McCullen goes for the kill.

          MCCULLEN
          The best. From Spain. And perhaps a
          couple of pretty young ladies to
          teach you how to use them.
          Guard #1 is even more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist.

          GUARD #2
          On yer feet, you Scottish pig.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          INT. FURNACE - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT

          Huge, sweaty, bare-chested PRISON WORKERS mould something in
          a furnace, a large chunk of metal in their red hot tongs. The
          two prison guards muscle McCullen into the room and start to
          fasten him to a standing rack as a PRIEST begins reciting the
          Lord's Prayer in Latin. The Warden steps up and reads the
          charges off a SCROLL OF PAPER.

          WARDEN
          James McCullen, you have been found
          guilty of treason for the sale of
          military arms to the enemies of our
          Lord King Louis XIII... even whilst
          you sold arms to our Lord himself.

          MCCULLEN
          Your King is a vile bag of filth
          who murders his own allies. I
          should've charged him double.

          WARDEN
          You tried to overthrow the Crown in
          conspiracy with its enemies!

          MCCULLEN
          They offered me a Chancellorship,
          because unlike your simpleton King,
          they know that is the McCullen
          destiny, to run the wars, the true
          power, not simply to supply arms.

          WARDEN
          Do you have anything else to say
          before the sentence is carried out?

          MCCULLEN
          Yes, I do. Clan McCullen is far
          bigger and more powerful than any
          of you could ever imagine. My sons
          will continue to rise along after I
          am gone. As will their sons. And,
          God willing, their sons.

          (SMILES)
          It shall not end with my death.
          The Warden smiles back sinisterly.

          WARDEN
          Oh, we're not going to kill you,
          McCullen. We're going to make an
          example of you.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          The Warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the
          METALLIC OBJECT from the fire. McCullen sees what it is
          before we do and his face fills with fear. It's a METAL MASK
          being carried towards him, the hinges open with a hideous
          creak. McCullen begins to struggle against the rack.

          WARDEN (CONT'D)
          So that no man, woman, nor child
          may ever see your treacherous face
          again, you shall wear this mask for
          the term of your natural life.
          The mask closes around his face. The workers melt the lock.
          McCullen SCREAMS. AND WE PUSH IN on the RED SQUARE MEDALLION.

          EXT. NATO HEADQUARTERS - BRUSSELS - DAY

          The many flags of NATO flap outside its massive headquarters.

          SUPER: NATO HEADQUARTERS, BELGIUM

          MCCULLEN (V.0.)
          War used to be the exception. Now
          it is the new state of play, a
          constant, unavoidable...

          INT. BRIEFING CHAMBER - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The RED SQUARE MEDALLION around the neck of JAMES McCULLEN,
          gazing over a lectern in a darkened room. Like his doomed
          ancestor, McCullen carries a proud defiance in his eyes.

          MCCULLEN
          Tragic as they are to fight, wars
          must be won. But perhaps they don't
          have to be as destructive as
          they've been in the past.
          A SERIES OF COMPLEX SCHEMATICS rolls continuously on a screen
          behind him. McCullen is briefing twenty-two NATO MILITARY
          COMMANDERS, many of them listening in TRANSLATION HEADPHONES.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Nano-mites. Perfect little
          soldiers. Their size can be
          programmed as well as their
          intended task. Originally developed
          to isolate and destroy cancer
          cells, but at Mars Industries, and
          with the help of a little NATO
          funding...

          

          

          

          

          4.
          A few laughs around the room. McCullen soaks it up.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          .we discovered how to program
          them to eliminate most anything.
          For instance... metal.
          ON SCREEN: A SOLDIER fires a shoulder-launched missile at a
          tank. The warhead bursts into millions of SILVER MICROSCOPIC
          NANO-MITES which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring a
          horse. Then the NANO-MITES fan out from the consumed tank and
          quickly head for a nearby jeep.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Once the target has been destroyed,
          the launcher triggers a kill switch
          unique to each warhead that short-
          circuits the nano-mites, preventing
          any unwanted destruction.
          ON SCREEN: The Soldier hits a KILL SWITCH on the launcher and
          the NANO-MITES instantly "drop dead" around the nearby jeep.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Each warhead contains seven million
          nano-mites and has the ability to
          eat anything from a single tank to
          an entire city.
          (to consummate salesman)
          But without innocent casualties.
          Which is why this has been such a
          priority for me and my company.
          The room breaks into APPLAUSE. FOCUSES ON GENERAL HAWK, a
          British veteran or countless battles, not buying it.

          HAWK
          Guess you'll be the first arms
          dealer up for the Nobel Peace
          Prize.
          Laughter in the room. McCullen smiles, being a good sport.

          MCCULLEN
          I prefer the term "armament
          solutions engineer"
          (more chuckles)
          Gentlemen! I'm pleased to announce
          that tomorrow morning your first
          order of nanotech warheads will
          ship from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.

          

          

          

          

          5.

          INT. MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          FOUR GLASS-LIKE WARHEADS, each the size of a softball, are
          placed into four separate compartments inside a WEAPONS CASE
          by a pair of LAB WORKERS. The KILL SWITCHES are secured next
          to each warhead. As the case is closed and locked we see the
          MARS Industries RED SQUARE MEDALLION LOGO on its cover.

          SUPER: KYRGYZSTAN, CENTRAL ASIA

          INT. MEN'S ROOM - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          A PAIR OF DOG TAGS drop INTO FRAME in SLOW MOTION. We see the
          name: "HAUSER, CONRAD R." Still not seeing his face, we watch
          our soldier strap into his BODY ARMOR and clip on his BATTLE
          HARNESS. His NAME TAG simply reads: "DUKE". He loads his into
          the mirror (is that a look of disdain?) and we get our first
          glimpse of our hero, a handsome, rugged combat veteran with a
          BATTLE SCAR under his right eye.
          The sound of RETCHING comes from the stall behind Duke. There
          is a flush and a strapping young Special Forces Soldier,
          STALWORTH, steps out. He goes to the sink next to Duke and
          splashes water on his face. He's pale and sweaty.

          DUKE
          The hell's wrong with you,
          Stalworth, you didn't eat that
          Chicken A La King at chow did ya?

          STALWORTH
          The mission, sir...

          DUKE
          What about it? Another day, another
          run.

          STALWORTH
          Never had anything to worry about
          before.
          Stalworth's shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to
          Duke: A YOUNG MOTHER with a NEWBORN in her arms.

          STALWORTH (CONT'D)
          Three weeks old. Be seeing him for
          the first time next leave.
          Duke looks at the picture, then at Stalworth. His eyes go
          distant thinking about his own past, then they harden again.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          DUKE
          You're off the mission.

          STALWORTH
          Sir?

          DUKE
          That's what you want, right?
          Stalworth doesn't argue. Duke hands him back the photo.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          If your head's with them, you're no
          good to me.
          Stalworth nods. Duke steps closer, now one mean s.o.b.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          One thing, though: you step off
          this one, you're out of Special
          Forces. Gonna find you a nice desk
          and chair back at the base. You're
          be run of the mill. Regular.

          STALWORTH
          I... I guess I can live with that.

          DUKE
          Then you should.
          Stalworth nods, grabs his kit, and leaves. Duke's hard eyes
          watch him go, then a slight smile creases his lips ...

          INT. CORRIDOR - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen exits the briefing room into the corridor outside,
          shaking hands with various Military Commanders. Hawk watches
          with his aide, a gorgeous German Lieutenant, COURTNEY "COVER
          GIRL" KRIEGER. When McCullen is alone, Hawk makes his move.

          HAWK
          Mr McCullen, Clayton Aernathy,
          British Army.

          MCCULLEN
          (shaking hands)
          I know who you are General hawk. As
          sharp in a briefing room as your
          reputation is on the battlefield.

          

          

          

          

          7.

          HAWK
          Not hardly ...You gave me a broad
          target, I couldn't resist.

          MCCULLEN
          It's an honor to meet a man of your
          many accomplishments.
          McCullen smiles, then offers Hawk to walk with him.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          What's on your mind, General?

          HAWK
          Your warheads. Securing them in
          transit. Forty pairs of ears in
          that room now know the when and
          where.

          MCCULLEN
          Those "ears" all have top security
          clearance.

          HAWK
          We both know what that's worth.

          MCCULLEN
          Look, General, delivery is my
          responsibility and it's not one I
          take lightly. I had NATO assign an
          elite American Special Forces unit,
          a fully armored convoy with air
          support. I assure you, my warheads
          will be quite safe.

          HAWK
          I've made a career of showing up
          where I'm needed, whether ordered
          to or not. And if your warheads are
          half as effective as you say they
          are.. Then my unit is needed.

          MCCULLEN
          This is no time to play catch up.
          The NATO team's been drilling for
          weeks. They're lit up and ready to
          roll.

          HAWK
          My unit doesn't need mission
          specific training. They're chosen
          because of their ability to handle
          any situation.

          

          

          

          

          8.

          MCCULLEN
          Maybe next time, General...
          (moves to go, stops)
          What did you say your unit was
          called?

          HAWK
          I didn't. I just said they were
          always ready.
          McCullen continues on down the hall. Hawk gives Cover Girl a
          look, she reads it and nods. WE SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. HIGH-TECH DELIVERY BAY - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          A FOUR MAN SECURITY DETAIL escorts two LAB WORKERS as they
          enter a high-tech delivery bay and wlak past two "COUGAR"
          PATROL VEHICLES and a huge ARMORED "GRIZZLY TRUCK, all armed
          with state-of-the-art rooftop weapons. FIFTEEN SPECIAL FORCES
          SOLDIERS stand at attention in front of Duke.

          DUKE
          All right, listen up, the Cougars
          will be front and back, Grizzly in
          the middle carrying the package.
          Minimum distance at all times.
          Choppers will cover us overhead.
          The Lab Workers step up.

          LAB WORKER #1
          Captain Hauser.
          Duke turns to them and start signing forms as WALLACE
          "RIPCORD" WEEMS takes the case while a little short on
          academic credentials, Rip is long on confidence, charm, and
          courage. These two guys are as close as brothers, for better
          and for worse. Rip looks at the Lab Guy with a jokey grin.

          RIPCORD
          Not gonna explode, is it?

          LAB WORKER
          (dead serious)
          They're not weaponized yet. And the
          kill switches are attached to the
          launchers. All the same, I'd avoid
          potholes if I were you.
          Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another
          soldier. Duke shoots him a look and Ripcord shrugs, what?

          

          

          

          

          9.

          RIPCORD
          Why not stick it in a chopper and
          fly it out? If you want, I could--

          DUKE
          --We have our orders. Okay, people!
          We're on the clock, let's move.

          RIPCORD

          MOUNT UP!
          Duke gives Rip another look. Rip throws him a cheesy grin.
          The team mounts up. The weapons case to Grizzly. ENGINES
          ignite. HEADLIGHTS beam. And the convoy rolls out.

          EXT. MARS FACTORY - KYRGYZSTAN - NIGHT

          The convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates,
          passing a sign: "MILITARY ARMAMENTS RESEARCH SYNDICATE". Two
          BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS swoop in and follow the convoy.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          Ripcord drives the lead Cougar, Duke beside him. Two more
          guys in back, remotely panning a rooftop DUAL MACHINE GUN.

          DUKE
          (into radio)
          Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We
          have the package and are on the dot
          to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900.

          RIPCORD
          You know, I hate all the Mother
          Goose, bird Dog crap, I just wish
          they'd let us say, "Hey, Pete, it's
          Bill, see ya in a few."

          DUKE
          Not me, I joined up for the jargon.

          VOICE ON RADIO
          Roger that, Bird Dog. Mother Goose
          out.

          RIPCORD
          Just saying, you know, if I ran
          things...

          

          

          

          

          10.

          DUKE
          Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay
          up all night, fill our canteen with
          tequila, and call each other "Bro".

          RIPCORD
          But we'd be badasses, right Bro?

          DUKE
          (with a sigh)
          Yeah, we'd be badasses. Eyes on the
          road, Rip.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN

          The two Blackhawks sweep through the skies, silhouetted by
          the rising sun. Below them, the convoy is thundering down a
          winding road amid the magnificent Tian Shan Mountain Range.

          INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A RADAR DISH on the rear Cougar sweeps vigilantly. Inside, a
          SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER watches the RADAR MONITOR, clear
          except for two steady :signatures", the Blackhawks.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          In the lead Cougar, Duke and Ripcord keep their eyes out.

          RIPCORD
          Hey Duke, ya know how they always
          tell you to empty your head of
          distracting thoughts on these runs?

          DUKE
          Keep your eyes on the road, Rip.

          RIPCORD
          And you know how people sometimes
          joke that it must be easy fr me to
          keep my mind empty?

          DUKE
          Don't listen to 'em. you got plenty
          of thoughts up there.
          (into radio)
          Keep rear security tight, boys.

          

          

          

          

          11.

          RIPCORD
          Well, the second I try and make
          myself not have thoughts, I always
          have 'em. Like now, know what I'm
          thinking about?

          DUKE
          Please don't say the Air Forces.

          RIPCORD
          The Air Forces.

          DUKE
          I thought we were done with that
          discussion.

          RIPCORD
          You were done with it, not me.
          Look, I loev flying...
          Duke "mouths" the following sentence as Ropcord says it:

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          I've been flying since I was
          thirteen years old.
          Ripcord shoots him a look. Duke just smiles.

          DUKE
          I don't think your daddy's crop
          duster counts as hours logged.

          RIPCORD
          Jets, man, jets. You know I always
          qualify when I'm on leave.

          DUKE
          Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get
          up in the air, we'll get you a
          trampoline back at the base.

          RIPCORD
          We've done ten years in the Army, I
          just think we should see if the
          grass really is greener.

          DUKE
          This continues to be the stupidest
          idea you've ever come up with, nd
          that's saying something.

          RIPCORD
          Funny. Real funny.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          DUKE
          I don't wanna transfer to the Air
          Force, okay?

          RIPCORD
          It's always about you, isn't it?
          Give me one good reason?

          DUKE
          I want to be in the fight, not
          flying over it.

          RIPCORD
          Won't be saying that when you call
          in an air strike and I come
          screaming in to save your--

          DUKE
          --Eyes on the road, Rip.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Behind the Blackhawks and the convoy an ominous, DARK SHAPE
          suddenly drops INTO FRAME. ENGINE EXHAUST blurs our view of
          the aircraft, but we can tell that it's pursuing the convoy.

          INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          On the rear Cougar's RADAR SCREEN, we see the two Blackhawk
          signatures still appearing in position.. .but nothing else.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          They hit a pothole. Ripcord grimaces, then realizes--

          RIPCORD
          Hey, on the training run weren't
          there herders around here?
          This puts Duke instantly on the alert.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Too late. CONCUSSION CANNONS slide out of ports on both sides
          of the dark shape. They fire simultaneously. The SUBATOMIC
          BLASTS punch into the front Blackhawk, crushing it like a
          beer can on your forehead. It explodes and drops.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke and Rip see the hall of flaming metal crash in front of
          them, blocking the convoy's path. Rip hits the brakes.

          RIPCORD
          Jesus Christ! Bird Down!

          DUKE
          (urgent, but utterly calm)
          Back up! Back up! Back up!
          (into radio)
          Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We
          are under attack. Repeat --we are
          under attack!

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          The second Blackhawk pivots to see the dark shape, --it's
          like a giant helicopter without rotors, hovering on six JET
          THRUSTERS. It's a next-gen "TYPHOON" GUNSHIP.
          The Blackhawk hoses the Typhoon with its six-barrelled MINI-
          GUNS. But the rounds bounce off the Typhoon's angled armor.
          The CONCUSSION CANNONS fire at the second Blackhawk, catching
          it on the nose, crushing it into a flaming ball and sending
          it reeling ass-over-tail-rotor into the ground behind the
          rear Cougar, hemming in the convoy.
          The Grizzly launches two HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES off its roof-
          turret, but the Typhoon guns them down and fires again. The
          blast lands directly on top of the rear Cougar, literally
          flattening it as well as every tree within a hundred feet.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke sees it all in his rear view mirror, yells into RADIO:

          DUKE
          Out! Everyone get out of the
          vehicles! Now!

          INT./EXT. GRIZZLY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A final CONCUSSION BLAST lands between the last two vehicles
          now. Spinning the Grizzly. It's WINDOWS SHATTER and a
          thousand lethal GLASS SHARDS shoot inside, killing the
          drivers. The Cougar flips end over and lands in a ditch.

          

          

          

          

          14.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord land on the upturned ceiling, beat to shit.
          Duke quickly checks on the two guys in back crushed to death
          where the blast caved in the Cougar's armor. He looks at Rip.

          DUKE
          You okay?

          RIPCORD

          (DAZED)
          Yeah, except for all the blood.
          Duke sees blood on the back of Rip's head. Then they hear a
          LOUD ROAR and turn to see the Typhoon hover by the Grizzly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Who the hell is that?
          Duke grabs Ripcord and starts dragging him out.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A SIDE DOOR on the Typhoon hisses open to reveal six
          "VIPERS", menacing foot soldiers clad head to toe in black
          BATTLE ARMOR, and armed with fearsome PULSE RIFLES. They exit
          the Typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left.
          The decimated Special Forces troops in the Grizzly OPEN FIRE
          with ASSAULT RIFLES, but the bullets can't penetrate the
          Viers' armor. The Vipers fire back, the impact from their
          pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and
          fling them backwards.
          Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them
          toward the Typhoon. The Vipers shoot one grenade out of the
          air with their pulse rifles. It EXPLODES well out of range as
          the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the
          pack. Another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six
          feet underground. A DULL WHOOMP, lifts the ground by a foot.
          Meanwhile, another figure emerges out of the Typhoon. Long,
          slender legs in high black boots, the rest if her covered in
          black, form-fitting BODY ARMOR. She's beautiful, exotic, and
          most of all, lethal. She's known in certain circles only as
          "THE BARONESS" but we will know her as ANA. Her DARK GLASSES
          glint menacingly as she strides towards the Grizzly.
          The two Special Forces Soldiers who threw the grenades pop up
          to shoot her. But she quick-draws a pair of PULSE PISTOLS.
          BOOM! BOOM! The shots crush both soldiers.

          

          

          

          

          15.
          Ana flips the pistols back into her holsters as a Viper blows
          the back door off the Grizzly, allowing her to climb inside.
          She blithely steps around the corpses and removes the WEAPONS

          CASE.
          Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is running like hell.

          RIPCORD
          Duke?

          DUKE
          Shut up.

          RIPCORD
          If I die...

          DUKE
          You're not gonna die.

          RIPCORD
          I just want you to know... you never
          could run worth a damn.

          DUKE
          Jesus, Rip.

          RIPCORD
          I'm just saying, it's be nice if
          you could move a little faster.
          And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast. Ana
          turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go
          ass-over-teacups down into a ditch. She touches the stem of
          her glasses which ZOOM IN on Duke.
          DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip.

          DUKE
          Stay here.

          RIPCORD
          (really messed up)
          Sure.

          DUKE
          I'm gettin' that package.
          Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs
          up the embankment. --And comes face to face with a Viper, who
          raises his pulse rifle, about to blow Duke away. A hand
          clamps down over the barrel.
          The Viper looks at Ana beside him. Duke also looks at her, a
          flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face.

          

          

          

          

          16.
          Ana touches the stem of her glasses and the DARK LENSES turn
          clear, revealing her gorgeous eyes.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          What the hell...?
          Her face softens hesitantly.

          ANA
          Hello, Duke...
          Then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face,
          knocks him out on his ass.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          You have to admit you had that
          coming.
          Ana struggles with something going on inside her head. Then
          her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the
          first Viper's gun barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Good-bye, Duke.
          Duke can't believe it. Ana suddenly glances up at something
          behind Duke. It's a "HOWLER" TRANSPORT rocketing onto the
          scene, its four-winged JET THRUSTERS rotating ninety degrees
          to slow it into a hover. Duke takes the opportunity to jump
          to his feet and lay out in the Viper. Ana turns and hauls-
          ass.
          A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and
          lands behind a Viper and SNAPS his neck. Moving in a blur, he
          draws and buries a KATANA BLADE into another Viper. Then he
          glances at the last Viper who's lining up on him, too far
          away to reach with his sword. He quick-draws a GLOCK PISTOL.
          BAM! Right between the eye slit in his helmet. All this in
          the space of six breathless seconds.
          Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of SNAKE-EYES
          sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking
          Glock. RED NINJA CLAN MARKING on his tri-cep. Bad-ass
          defined. Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse
          burst just missed him. Duke immediately takes off after Ana,
          his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands, PULSE
          BURSTS crackling past his head. He curses under his breath:

          DUKE
          Air Force.. .right.

          

          

          

          

          17.
          A Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like ARROW BOLT rips
          through his eye-slit and ELECTROCUTES him, courtesy of SHANA
          "SCARLETT" O'HARA who fast-ropes down from the Howler,
          holding a gas-propulsion CROSSBOW PISTOL. She lines up on
          another Viper, but he's too quick, ducks behind the GRIZZLY.
          But Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL viewfinder snapped an image of
          his FACE ARMOR. She darts behind the COUGAR WRECK with Snake-
          Eyes, swiftly targeting the Viper's eye-slit on her pistol's
          LED SCREEN. Then she fires behind her, in the complete other
          direction to the Viper, the arrow bolt flies away, then turns
          around and zeroes in on the Viper, finding him behind cover,
          the smart-arrow slams right through his eye-slit.
          Another Viper sees this and bolts toward the Typhoon, but
          LAMONT "HEAVY DUTY" MORRIS leans out of the landing Howler
          holding a dual MACHINE GUN/GRENADE LAUNCHER. Only a man this
          big can carry such a weapon.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Time to lay down some bass!
          He fires a grenade and the Viper flies back OUT OF FRAME. You
          blink, you miss it. BOOM! The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty,
          but the Howler is just as nimble, fires its LEFT-SIDE
          THRUSTERS which roll it onto its side. The CONCUSSION BLASTS
          whip past and decimate the forest behind it. Hanging
          awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades.
          The Typhoon's mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air.
          The Howler fires MISSILES which hit the CONCUSSION CANNONS
          and rip them apart. The Typhoon SHAKES. Ana races for the
          recovering Typhoon. Duke races after her through a hail of
          pulse-fire and draws his PISTOL.

          DUKE
          Ana!
          She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest
          and face, using it as a shield. Duke hesitates, because of
          the warheads or Ana? Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her.

          SCARLETT
          The warheads!
          Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana
          backpedal towards the waiting Typhoon. Duke charges like a
          bull and tackles her. Ana sprawls and the case tumbles free.
          Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then Duke goes
          after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray
          gunfire her way. Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon,
          which is raked by the bullets.

          

          

          

          

          18.
          Duke grabs up the case as the Typhoon launches into the sky
          and disappears over a rise ...
          SILENCE... Scarlett, Snake-eyes and Heavy Duty now approach
          Duke, who whirls around at them, pistol up, eyes wild.

          DUKE
          Stand down! Stand the hell down!

          HEAVY DUTY
          Lower your weapon, Sir. We're not
          the enemy.

          DUKE
          Pointing weapons at me doesn't make
          you my friend.
          ABEL "BREAKER" SHAZ jumps out of the Howler wearing a
          computerized SURVEILLANCE SUIT, a French/Tunisian ACCENT:

          BREAKER
          Please hand over the case, sir.

          DUKE
          I don't know who you are, and I
          sure as hell don't know who they
          are, and until I find out, I'm not
          lowering anything or handling
          anything over.
          CLICK-CLACK. They turn to see Ripcord shouldering a rifle.

          RIPCORD
          What's your unit?

          SCARLETT
          That's classified.
          Snake-Eyes discreetly grabs SHRUNKEN THROWING STARS from his
          belt, but a look from Scarlett makes him out them back.

          BREAKER
          Someone would like a word with you.
          Breaker sets a holo-projector on the ground in front of Duke,
          which projects a 3D IMAGE OF GENERAL HAWK. Duke is stunned.

          HAWK
          State you name and rank.

          DUKE
          .you first.

          

          

          

          

          19.

          HAWK
          My team just saved your life. now's
          the part where you say "thank you".

          DUKE
          Those aren't the words that come to
          mind just now. We weren't told
          about any support for this mission,
          so you better tell your team to
          stand down.
          Ripcord eyes his sight.

          RIPCORD
          Happy to turn this into a turkey
          shoot.
          Someone OFF-PROJECTOR hands Hawk a file, he looks at it.

          HAWK
          You must be... Ripcord, expert
          marksman, weapons specialist, jet

          QUALIFIED--

          RIPCORD
          (to Duke)
          Told ya.

          HAWK
          I'm General Clayton Abernathy. You
          may have heard of me, .Duke.
          A glint of recognition flickers across Duke's eyes, he nods.

          DUKE
          General hawk. Afghanistan, NATO
          Forward Command...
          Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and
          starts sweeping a scanner across the case. Hawk smiles.

          HAWK
          That was my last job.
          (a twinkle in his eye)
          I'm in a whole new outfit now.
          Duke swivels his gun to Breaker's head. Breaker flinches.

          BREAKER
          Just need to deactivate its
          tracking beacon, for security.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          HAWK
          Hand over the weapons case son, and
          let us deliver the warheads.

          DUKE
          No way. I signed for 'em. My
          mission, my package. I carry them,
          I deliver them.
          Breaker's scanner BEEPS. He keys a button. The BEEPING
          promptly stops. He throws a look at Duke.

          BREAKER
          Wasn't hard, was it?

          DUKE
          Fine. But you seem to be a little
          short on transportation a the
          moment. Team Alpha will deliver you
          to me.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          And where exactly are you, General?

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Hawk stands in front of a HOLO-CAM amongst a sea of
          computers, Cover Girl behind him, Duke on a monitor.

          HAWK
          Come see for yourself.

          EXT. HOWLER - EGYPTIAN SKIES - DUSK

          The Howler skims over the GIANT PYRAMIDS OF GIZA, a caravan
          of camels below. The aircraft continues out into the golden
          desert, too fast for anybody to get a good look at it.

          INT. HOWLER -SKIES - DUSK

          Scarlett is cleaning Ripcord's head wound.

          RIPCORD
          Hey, you're cute.

          SCARLETT
          He's going into shock.

          RIPCORD
          What's your name, darlin'?

          

          

          

          

          21.
          Snake-Eyes stabs Ripcord hard int he arm with a drip-needle,
          Rip angrily eyeballs him and stifles a scream.

          SCARLETT
          I thought all the Special Ops guys
          were tough.

          RIPCORD
          We are tough ... . but also sensitive.
          (feeling the drugs)
          Whoa, that's some mucho primo stuff
          you gave me.
          Rip is high now, his eyes float up to Heavy Duty who stares
          back at him. Rip reaches out to touch his well-cropped hair.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          .and a kung-fu grip.

          HEAVY DUTY
          The name's Heavy Duty.
          Duke has the weapons case on his lap.

          DUKE
          What kind of outfit is this? Not
          regular Army based on the accents.
          (to Scarlett)
          I have you as an Aussie...
          (looks to Heavy Duty)
          And you're a Johannesburger...
          (then Breaker)
          And you: French North Africa.
          Algiers?

          BREAKER
          Tunisia. Where were you born?

          RIPCORD
          Are you kidding me? Duke wasn't
          born, he was Government-Issued!

          DUKE
          But somehow you're all in the same
          unit. One you can't tell me the
          name of right?

          SCARLETT
          We'd get tossed for telling.

          

          

          

          

          22.

          RIPCORD
          Duke, Duke, don't you get it:
          they're super secret, they're
          Mission Impossible. This tape's
          gonna self-destruct in five--

          DUKE
          --You're gonna go after them aren't
          you? The ones that hit my convoy.

          (SILENCE)
          Then whoever you are, whatever this
          unit is, I want in.

          BREAKER
          Not our call.
          Ripcord sits up, really woozy, looks at Scarlett.

          RIPCORD
          I want in too. That way we can
          spend some bunker time together.
          A SWORD suddenly slices across Rip's face, an inch away. It's
          Snake-Eyes, checking his blade, seemingly innocent. But the
          message is not lost on Ripcord. Scarlett looks at Duke.

          SCARLETT
          You two a team or something?

          RIPCORD
          We've been together forever.
          (off her look)
          But not like that. Hi, I'm Ripcord.

          SCARLETT
          Why do they call you that?
          Breaker laughs, reading Ripcord's file:

          BREAKER
          Because his name is Wallace Weems!

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Eight SECURITY TECHNICIANS sit around an island console in a
          small, windowless room. Working their keyboards and watching
          the HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE of the Howler soaring across the dunes.
          A technician hits a LARGE SWITCH on his console.

          SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1
          Alpha-One, this is Base. You are
          cleared or entry.

          

          

          

          

          23.

          EXT. HOWLER - SKIES - DAY

          And a huge sand dune directly in front of Howler spirals open
          to reveal a CAVERNOUS HOLE. The Howler's THRUSTERS twist
          vertical and it drops like a helicopter into the hole.
          SUPER: Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity.

          INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY

          The Howler descends beneath the surface onto a dark platform
          as the roof spirals shut and FLOOD LIGHTS switch on. The door
          of the howler opens and the team steps out. Duke and Ripcord
          follow hesitantly with the weapons case. A VOICE calls out to
          them from the shadows:

          HAWK (O.S.)
          Welcome to the new Pit!
          Duke and Ripcord turn to see hawk and Cover girl walking out
          from behind the lights.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          Duke.

          DUKE
          General.

          HAWK
          I've read a lot about you two.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, look, I didn't "steal" that
          Blackhawk, I was borrowing it...
          Duke shoots him a look. Hawk steps right up to Duke.

          HAWK
          Matter of fact, I saw that one of
          my subordinates tried to recruit
          you to our little operation a while
          back.

          DUKE
          I was never asked to join any Op
          group.

          HAWK
          Remember a tall gentleman
          approaching you in Thailand when
          you were on leave, four years ago?

          

          

          

          

          24.

          DUKE
          Vaguely.

          HAWK
          Right before you tore up the bar?

          RIPCORD
          Four years? My man had some issues.
          Duke shoots him another look, then turns back to Hawk.

          DUKE
          This doesn't look like any Tac Op
          I've ever seen. Where are we?

          HAWK
          Okay, you trusted me by going with
          my team, so I'll trust you.
          There's a loud METALLIC CLANG and part of the PLATFORM begins
          to descend. They pass the URBAN COMBAT LEVEL where MEN and
          WOMEN are training with next-gen urban warfare equipment.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          Technically, GI JOE doesn't exist.
          But if it did, it'd be comprised of
          the top men and women from the best
          military units all over the world.
          The alpha dogs...
          They see a pretty woman sip into a next-gen CAMO-SUIT, which
          reflects and refracts light, making her nearly invisible.

          RIPCORD
          Oh man, I want one of those.

          BREAKER
          The suit or the girl?

          RIPCORD
          Both.
          Scarlett's eyes roll. They descend into the DESERT COMBAT
          level, where soldiers train with desert warfare equipment.

          HAWK
          Ten nations signed on in their
          first year. Working together,
          sharing intel. Now we have twenty-
          three.

          

          

          

          

          25.

          DUKE
          I've never seen combat gear this
          sleek, what's the trick?

          SCARLETT
          Liquid armor.
          They reach the DEEP SEA COMBAT LEVEL where dozens of men and
          women are testing fantastic next-gen UNDERWATER VEHICLES.

          HAWK (O.S.)
          Good news is we've been pretty
          successful so far. The bad news is
          whenever we manage to shut down one
          organization, another springs up in
          its place.

          RIPCORD
          Who could possibly fund all this?

          HEAVY DUTY
          Oprah.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Hawk now leads the group into the Control Room where more
          TECHNICIANS man consoles. Duke still has the weapons case.

          CONTROL ROOM TECHNICIAN #1
          Mr. McCullen's standing by, Sir.

          HAWK
          Patch him through, please.

          DUKE
          So who hit us out there?

          COVER GIRL
          Currently unidentified.

          HEAVY DUTY
          And how'd that bitch in leather get
          a jump jet like ours?

          SCARLETT
          Whoever she is, she's clearly well-
          financed, with access to highly
          classified intel and state of the
          art weaponry. Their capabilities
          are beyond anything we've ever
          encountered.

          

          

          

          

          26.

          RIPCORD
          That's the reason we got our asses
          kicked.
          Duke betrays nothing. Hawk looks at him.

          HAWK
          We're going to need to find out
          everything we can about her.
          Knowing is half the battle.

          RIPCORD
          What's the other half?
          McCullen now appears next to Ripcord and walks through him.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Jesus!
          And we realize McCullen is here courtesy of a HOLO-PROJECTOR.
          A ring of cameras provides him with images of the Joes.

          HAWK
          Gentlemen, this is James McCullen,
          CEO of MARS Industries, the man who
          built these warheads.
          WE INTERCUT THIS SCENE WITH McCullen standing in front of a
          HOLO-CAM in a small room somewhere. THE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES of
          hawk, Duke, and the others around him.

          MCCULLEN
          General, most men I've encountered
          in this business over-promise and
          under-deliver. You're the opposite.
          Clearly, you were the security
          option I should have chosen.
          ON DUKE: Steaming behind his military demeanor.

          DUKE
          My team did everything we could out
          there. A lot of good men went down--

          MCCULLEN
          --But not you.

          DUKE
          That mission was classified, sir.
          Clearly, somebody sold us out.

          

          

          

          

          27.

          MCCULLEN
          I've spent ten years and thirteen
          billion Euros creating these four
          warheads. Your job, Captain, was to
          protect them, and if it wasn't for
          General Hawk, you would've failed.

          HAWK
          That's not a fair assessment. He
          followed his orders to the letter.

          MCCULLEN
          Well that wasn't enough.
          Duke bristles. McCullen turns to Hawk.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          What are your coordinates? I'll
          have NATO send another special ops
          team to retrieve the warheads,
          company strength this time.

          HAWK
          Apologizes, Mr McCullen. It's not
          that I don't trust you...I don't
          trust anybody.

          MCCULLEN

          (SMILES)
          Are you sure you're not a McCullen?

          HAWK
          I don't talk smooth enough to be a
          McCullen.

          MCCULLEN
          You do just fine, General. Now, so
          the bastards who attacked you can't
          find you, you need to disable the
          tracking beacon hidden in the case.

          BREAKER
          We already have.

          MCCULLEN
          Good man. So, can I count on you to
          deliver the warheads to NATO now?

          HAWK
          I think it unwise to expose them at
          the moment. This group might make
          another attempt.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          28.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          We need to find and neutralize them
          before we can consider moving your
          weapons.

          MCCULLEN
          Alright. But allow me to check the
          warheads to see if any have been
          damaged.
          Duke begrudgingly sets the case down. Breaker turns on his
          suit's BALL-EYEPIECE. It goes into X-RAY MODE and we see the
          NANO-MITES crawling around inside the four warheads.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Open it, please.

          BREAKER
          My scan says they're intact...

          MCCULLEN
          General?

          HAWK
          What's the code?
          ON DUKE, listening carefully.

          MCCULLEN
          Five-two-nine-four-four-oh.
          Breaker enters the code. As the case opens, Breaker
          discreetly watches McCullen in his BALL-EYEPIECE SCANNER.
          McCullen runs his holographic fingers over the warheads.
          Satisfied, he turns to Hawk.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Please keep me informed of your
          progress, General.
          Duke and McCullen share a quick glare. And then McCullen cuts
          the feed. Scarlett notices concern on Breaker's face.

          SCARLETT
          Breaker?

          BREAKER
          That bloke's Beta waves were going
          up, down, and sideways... I think
          he's hiding something.
          And off the faces of the rest of the group WE CUT BACK TO:

          

          

          

          

          29.

          INT./EXT TRIDENT - DAY

          McCullen turns as Ana appears on a HOLO-PROJECTOR behind him.

          MCCULLEN
          I spend five years setting this up.
          Wringing money out of NATO. This
          was supposed to be the easy part.

          ANA
          If you'd let me stage the assault
          at your precious factory, we could
          have contained the situation.

          MCCULLEN
          And lost the trust of our clients
          in the process? It had to be NATO's
          fault.
          (steps closer)
          What happened? Did you hesitate?

          ANA
          You're implying this was about some
          ancient history? That's as
          laughable as your Intel. What went
          wrong was the Joes appearing out of
          nowhere.
          He stares at her suspiciously, then softens.

          MCCULLEN
          Forgive me, jealousy isn't my
          strong suit.

          ANA
          Forget that, where are we now? Have
          you tracked the case?

          MCCULLEN
          They deactivated the beacon. I gave
          them a code to quietly re-arm it.
          McCullen hits a key, a SCREEN switches on, displaying A MAP
          OF THE WORLD. A BEACON LIGHT flashes over a spot in the
          Egyptian desert, grip coordinates blinking.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          There it is. The infamous Pit.

          ANA
          I will get those warheads back.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          McCullen steps forward and lovingly caresses her face, his
          hand going right through her. McCullen whispers menacingly.

          MCCULLEN
          I hope so.

          ANA
          (diffusing the threat)
          If I were really there, I might
          actually let you touch me.

          MCCULLEN
          (sly smile)
          I'll send a jet.

          ANA
          Business first. Besides, I'm
          married, remember?
          Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room.

          MCCULLEN
          Sometimes I really hate technology.
          He sighs heavily, then hears a VOICE:

          STORM SHADOW (O.S.)
          It is most often used by those
          without honor.
          McCullen turns to see STORM SHADOW, a well-tailored Korean
          man whose soul has long since departed, standing on the other
          side of the room.

          MCCULLEN
          There can't be any more mistakes.
          The schedule can't be compromised
          any further.

          STORM SHADOW
          If you had sent me, it would be
          done.

          MCCULLEN
          (walking towards him)
          I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
          To the Baroness's villa. .Make
          sure her commitment doesn't waiver.
          Storm Shadow nods, McCullen continues on THROUGH him. We now
          realize Storm Shadow was a holo-proj. Storm Shadow vanishes.

          

          

          

          

          31.
          McCullen steps up to a large oval perspex window. WE PULL
          BACK out of the window to reveal that he's riding through
          DEEP ARCTIC OCEAN inside a next-gen "TRIDENT" submarine.
          CAMERA KEEPS PULLING BACK to show the Trident approaching the
          docking bay of a MASSIVE FACILITY built into the seabed under
          the jagged canopy of the POLAR ICE CAP. The place is defended
          by several HARPOON CANNONS and a fearsome TURBO-LASER. It's a
          breath-taking sight, but also a little frightening.

          INT. DOCKING BAY - DAY

          The MARS LOGO is stamped on a pair of WATER-TIGHT DOORS. The
          logo pulls apart as the doors open, allowing McCullen inside
          the docking back entrance. Waiting for him is a man known
          only as THE DOCTOR. His face hidden by a life-support mask
          that continually pumps air into his lungs and also
          mechanically helps him to speak without the vocal chords he
          is missing.

          THE DOCTOR
          Welcome back.

          MCCULLEN
          Good to be back.

          THE DOCTOR
          we've been very busy.
          He gestures to TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all
          standing at attention, not a single muscle moving among them.
          These are NEO-VIPERS. The baddest of the bad.

          MCCULLEN
          Is it working?

          THE DOCTOR
          You tell me.
          The Doctor beckons a waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a
          glass case containing an eighteen foot long KING COBRA. the
          Doctor bends down and gazes at the snake.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          The King Cobra is a magnificent
          creature. Its venom can kill a
          full grown elephant with a single
          bite.
          He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing
          its hood. The Doctor steps up to a Neo-Viper and shows
          McCullen an INCISION SCAR behind the Neo-Vipers' right ears.

          

          

          

          

          32.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          We introduced into each subject one
          thousand cc's of the nano-mite
          solution. As expected, subjects
          became extremely ill and fell into
          a coma-like state for approximately
          forty hours.
          The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket,
          A FILE PHOTO of a Neo-Viper appears on the device's screen.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          When they returned to sentience,
          brain scans showed complete
          inactivity in the self-preservation
          region of the cortex.

          MCCULLEN
          English, Doctor.
          The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps
          up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal.

          THE DOCTOR
          They feel no fear.
          The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites
          his arm, latching on, sinking its venom into his veins. The
          Neo-Viper doesn't even wince.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Cortical nerve clusters revealed
          complete inactivity--

          MCCULLEN
          --Doctor.

          THE DOCTOR
          They feel no pain.
          The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently
          lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Frontal lobe concepts of morality
          are disengaged... No remorse...

          MCCULLEN
          And they are completely obedient?

          THE DOCTOR
          Of course. .The real world
          applications are endless.

          

          

          

          

          33.
          The Neo-Viper's knees give out. McCullen watches curiously.
          WE SMASH CUT INTO the NEO-VIPER'S BITE WOUND where the WHITE
          VENOM is racing through a blinding labyrinth of veins.

          THE DOCTOR (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The nano-mites will target the
          venom.
          STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES
          rushing to meet the venom head on. Blocking it.
          Then swiftly pushing it back. All the way to the original
          fang holes. The venom seeps out of the holes and drips off
          the Neo-Viper's arm. He stands and returns to his place in
          line without a word. The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          So you tell me: is it working?

          INT. CORRIDORS - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The Doctor follows McCullen through various corridors.

          THE DOCTOR
          The science is staggering isn't it?

          MCCULLEN
          You've done well. You've thrown the
          caber clear out of the yard.

          THE DOCTOR
          But research and science are
          expensive propositions. If I can
          make a suggestion..?
          McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly
          menacing and evil behind this Doctor's mask.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Selling one batch of warheads on
          the black market could fund--

          MCCULLEN
          --I appreciate your thirst for
          knowledge, Doctor. But this world
          is messy enough. Factions fighting
          and scrabbling for control, for
          resources, and it's only going to
          get worse as the century
          progresses. No. What the world
          needs is unification. Leadership.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          34.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          It needs to be taken out of chaos
          by someone with complete control.
          He looks through a portal into a shadowy OPERATING CHAMBER,
          where a brilliant but vicious looking MAN is being scanned by
          SMART ROBOTS. This is ZARTAN. A Smart Robot begins to change
          Zartan's fingerprints, which we see on a monitor.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          My family was once this close to
          that kind of power...

          (LAUGHS)
          The French...
          Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a nod. McCullen
          looks back at the Doctor.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Once I get my hands on the reins,
          the money will take care of itself.
          You'll be able to do all the
          research you want.
          McCullen strides off. The Doctor stares after him.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          Duke, still holding the briefcase, stares at a PHOTO OF ANA
          from the ambush, now up on a monitor.

          BREAKER
          We grabbed an image from Heavy-
          Duty's helmet cam.
          Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers:

          RIPCORD
          Hey, that's--
          Duke cuts him off with a look. Breaker extracts a full 3D
          FRONT-VIEW of Ana's face from the photo. Then on an adjacent
          monitor, he runs an endless series of PHOTOS OF WOMEN.

          BREAKER
          Now we can run the face through an
          infinity scan.

          HAWK
          We have access to any photograph on
          any server anywhere in the world.

          

          

          

          

          35.

          BREAKER
          Everyone gets photographed in some
          way at some time. ATM machines,
          airports, crowd shots at a football
          game. We'll find her.
          Duke just stares at Ana's photo. Ripcord whispers quietly:

          RIPCORD
          You okay?

          DUKE
          (not okay)
          .what happened to her?
          For once, Ripcord doesn't know what to say. Cover Girl walks
          in and hands a document to Hawk, who looks through it.

          HAWK
          From NATO. I am now the official
          custodian of the warheads. Your
          mission is complete. Once you hand
          it over, that is.
          Duke nods, hands over the case with a hint of defeat.

          DUKE
          When you move it, she's gonna come
          after you, you know that, right?
          (off Hawk's look)
          And with her Intel, and her toys...
          she'll find you.

          HAWK
          And your point is...?

          DUKE
          You're going to go after her first.
          And I want to help.

          RIPCORD
          Let us in on this, General. Our
          team just got wasted. I think a
          little payback is in order.

          HAWK
          You don't ask to be a part of GI
          JOE. You get asked.

          DUKE
          You scouted me four years ago, now
          I'm ready. Let's have at it.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          HAWK
          I've lost men too, Captain. Good
          men. But attempting to--

          DUKE
          I know her.

          HAWK
          Excuse me?

          DUKE
          You said knowing is half the
          battle. Well, I know who she is.
          Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and shows
          Hawk. INSERT PHOTO: Ana, four years earlier, much softer
          looking, staring lovingly at Duke as they're about to kiss.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Her name is Ana Lewis, and I can
          tell you everything you need to
          know about her until... four years
          ago. After that, well, obviously
          sa lot's changed.
          Hawk just stares in disbelief.

          INT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - DAY

          Hawk sits down behind his desk and looks up at Duke, still
          standing at attention.

          HAWK
          Before this goes any further, I
          need to know what I'm dealing with,
          a man looking to settle a score, or
          a man who can put the mission
          first. Because the battlefield is
          the wrong place for emotion.
          (he pauses for effect)
          Could you kill her?

          DUKE
          If I had to.

          HAWK
          Chances are you will. But if you
          flinch, hesitate even an instant...
          what I'm trying to say is, unless
          you can kill her graveyard dead I
          don't want you.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          DUKE
          I can.
          (off Hawk's look)
          I signed on to deliver those
          warheads, General, and despite your
          present authority, I want to finish
          the job.
          Hawk regards him for a moment.

          HAWK
          So tell me about her.

          DUKE
          Okay, I'll start right here: I hope
          that vault is tight, because she
          always gets what she wants...

          EXT. THE BARONESS' MANSION - PARIS - NIGHT

          A BLACK, BEEFED-UP SUV drives towards a magnificent mansion
          in the Parisian suburbs. Though the vehicle looks relatively
          harmless, we'll come to know it as a "SCARAB" attack truck.

          SUPER: PARIS, FRANCE

          INT. FOYER - THE BARONESS' MANSION - PARIS - NIGHT

          Ana enters the mansion. SERVANTS take her coat as her
          handsome, sophisticated and well dressed husband, BARON LEON
          DECOBRAY, glides up to her, very French. They kiss warmly.

          DECOBRAY
          Hello, darling.

          ANA
          How is work at the lab?

          DECOBRAY
          Steady progress.

          ANA
          So the Minister of Defense was
          pleased?

          DECOBRAY
          He was. You know I wish I could
          tell you more...

          ANA
          Of course.

          

          

          

          

          38.

          DECOBRAY
          You were gone a long time. How
          were the shops in Monte Carlo?

          ANA
          I didn't get what I was after.
          They head up the stairs.

          DECOBRAY
          I suppose I should be grateful.

          ANA
          Most husbands would be.

          DECOBRAY
          Most husbands don't have such
          mysterious wives, they know exactly
          where they are and what they do.

          ANA

          (TEASING)
          They think they know.

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE BARONESS' CASTLE - NIGHT

          Ana throws open the double doors to her grand bedroom on a
          high floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower.

          ANA
          I never get over how beautiful...

          DECOBRAY
          (staring at Ana)
          Neither do I.
          She spots Storm Shadow standing in an ante room and quickly
          spins to face her husband. She pulls Decobray close and
          kisses him. Storm Shadow makes a move, but ana warns him off
          with her eyes, She finishes the kiss and looks at Decobray.

          ANA
          Let me change and freshen up and
          I'll meet you for dinner.

          DECOBRAY
          Of course.
          Decobray smiles at her and leaves. The smile falls from
          Ana's face as she spins around and heads for Storm Shadow.

          

          

          

          

          39.

          STORM SHADOW
          Mr. McCullen gave me explicit
          orders to sever the Baron's spine
          if he so much as touched you.

          ANA
          He's my husband, of course he
          touches me. Tell McCullen to grow
          up. Besides, the Baron says his
          work in the lab goes much better
          after we've... touched. And that's
          the important thing.

          STORM SHADOW
          I'll be accompanying you to
          retrieve the warheads this time.
          Along with some of the men the
          Doctor's been working on.

          ANA
          (with distaste)
          The Doctor.

          STORM SHADOW
          We go at dawn.
          Storm Shadow turns and heads out through the doors. Ana
          Stands alone in her room now, she heads over to her dresser
          and opens a hidden drawer. Inside is a SMALL BOX. She opens
          it carefully and gazes at an ENGAGEMENT RING inside.
          Something sad and lonely in her eyes... And WE FLASHBACK TO:

          INT. MILITARY CLUB - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

          A crowded military club. OFFICERS and ENLISTED dancing to an
          orchestra. And there's Ana, the most beautiful woman in the
          room. Wearing a black dress. Slightly younger and with none
          of the cold viciousness she displayed earlier. She's dancing
          with Duke who's wearing his officer's DRESS UNIFORM, replete
          with bars and medals. She laughs as Duke whispers something
          in her ear. She's in love. And so is he.
          Ripcord is in a booth, downing shots with four ENLISTED
          WOMEN. He has his arms around two of them and looks loaded.

          RIPCORD
          My hot tub only holds four.

          (COUNTS)
          No, five.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          EXT. VERANDAH - OFFICER'S CLUB - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

          Duke leads Ana outside onto a quiet verandah, the lights of
          Washington shimmering beyond them. He suddenly kneels down
          in front of her, an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box in his hand.
          Ana gasps with shock and joy, tears welling in her eyes.

          DUKE
          I've been wanting to do this before
          we deploy.

          ANA
          Duke...it's beautiful. It's too
          nice you lunatic.

          DUKE
          Only time I'm buying one of these,
          so why not?
          They stare a each other, a touching beat. Then Duke screws
          up his face, worried?

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Well, what do you say?
          She's too emotional to speak. And then they hear:

          REX (O.S.)
          Say yes, you idiot...!
          Lieutenant REX LEWIS saunters up, MEDICAL INSIGNIA on his
          collar. The look on his face tells us he's happy for them.

          REX (CONT'D)
          .Before I tell my new brother-in-
          law what it's like to share a
          bathroom with you.

          DUKE
          Thanks for killing the mood, Rex.

          REX
          I was coming to offer you a ride
          back to post.

          ANA
          Time already?

          DUKE
          We go at oh-five hundred.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          ANA
          Is it WMDs? It is, right? That's
          why you're pulling Rex out of the

          LAB--

          DUKE
          Ana, we can't--

          ANA
          Yeah, yeah. Classified. Top
          Secret. Have to kill me if you
          told me, blah, blah, blah.

          DUKE
          Speaking of classified information,
          you still haven't answered.

          ANA
          Yes. Of course it's yes. On one

          CONDITION--
          She grabs REX and pulls him down on his knees next to Duke.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Promise me that you won't let my
          genius egghead brother get hurt.
          (looks at Rex)
          He's the only family I've got left.
          (back to Duke)
          Promise me.

          DUKE
          I promise.
          She smiles and holds out her hand. He threads the ring onto
          her trembling finger. Rex smiles, but in his eyes is a glint
          of instability. Ripcord comes CRASHING OUT through shuttered
          doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Jesus, Rip.
          Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors:

          RIPCORD
          How was I supposed know she was
          married!?
          (then, notices the ring)
          Nice rock! Hey, are you proposing?

          DUKE
          I'm done proposing.

          

          

          

          

          42.

          ANA
          I already said yes.

          RIPCORD
          Not official until you answer my
          question. Do you love my boy?

          ANA
          Always and forever.
          Ripcord flips open his CELL PHONE and takes the photo of Ana
          that Duke carries with him.

          RIPCORD
          Now I've gotta find someone to love
          me, as many times as possible for
          the next three hours.
          WE PUSH IN ON THE PHOTO, then SMASH CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.

          INT. THE PIT - URBAN ENVIRONMENT - DAY

          On Duke, watching Heavy Duty pulling out an ACCELERATOR SUIT.

          HEAVY DUTY
          If you want to join us, you'll need
          to be mission ready, Joe style.
          This is the Mark One Accelerator
          Suit.

          RIPCORD
          What's it accelerate?

          HEAVY DUTY
          You. It'll make you run faster,
          jump higher, and hit harder than
          any of your enemies.
          A TITANIUM BOOT slides over a shoe. COBALT MACHINE PARTS
          snap into place with a HISS over Duke and Rip's arms and
          legs.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          Head-to-toe turbo-hydraulics and
          highly-pressurized pneumatics.
          They both slap on aerodynamic, flying-wing HELMETS. Inside,
          the CYBERNETIC POWER-UP with an ear piercing whine. LASER
          ENHANCED LED readouts scramble and fritz across their HUDs.

          

          

          

          

          43.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          An advanced cybernetics heads-up
          display, feeding into your helmet.
          Duke checks out two gas-propelled GRAPPLING SPEARS and six
          WRIST ROCKETS around his right forearm.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          Two gas propelled grappling spears
          and six ten millimeter, hi-
          explosive, heat seeking, fire-and-
          forget rockers.
          Rip spins the twin barrels of a caseless SUBMACHINE GUN on
          his left forearm. A Cheshire grin spreads across his face.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          And a nine millimeter, caseless
          submachine gun with six hundred
          rounds capable of firing all of
          them in thirty seconds.
          Duke and Ripcord are now buckled in, getting a feel for the
          FLEXIBLE, POLY-ALLOY SUITS. Ripcord glances at Heavy Duty.

          RIPCORD
          I just missed everything you said.
          (turns to Duke)
          How do I look? Pretty cool, huh?

          INT. TARGET RANGE - URBAN COMBAT LEVEL - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord run through and URBAN ENVIRONMENT OBSTACLE
          COURSE, 3D HOLO-PROJECTION TERRORISTS lunging out at them.
          The guys take them out one by one, never more than a split
          second after they appear. The HOLO-PROJECTIONS fritz and
          die. They reach the end of the and a BUZZER SOUNDS. At the
          back, arms crossed, impassively taking it all in, is Hawk.
          Scarlett approaches the guys with an ELECTRONIC CLIPBOARD.

          SCARLETT
          Sixty-three seconds. Not Bad. But
          not good enough. Gotta get under a
          minute to qualify.

          DUKE
          What's the record?

          SCARLETT
          Forty-five.

          

          

          

          

          44.

          RIPCORD
          Don't tell me, Snake-Eyes?

          SCARLETT
          No, me.
          Ripcord glances at Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL.

          RIPCORD
          You can do this whole course with
          that thing in forty-five seconds?

          SCARLETT
          If you're going to shoot at
          something, kill it. Otherwise take
          up knitting.

          RIPCORD
          When I want something, I don't just
          shoot at it...
          (steps close to her)
          When I get a target in my sights, I
          take it down.
          His meaning is clear. She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine
          into her CROSSBOW PISTOL and hands it to him.

          SCARLETT
          Here. Go on. Try it.

          RIPCORD
          I wouldn't want to show you up.

          SCARLETT
          Oh, that's so thoughtful of you.

          RIPCORD
          What can I tell you? I guess I'm
          just a considerate, humble guy.
          You'll learn that about me.

          SCARLETT
          I'm the "target in your sights,"
          right? You've got ten rounds to
          "take me down".

          RIPCORD
          I don't want to hurt you.

          SCARLETT
          They're training arrows. The most
          I'll feel is a little jolt.

          

          

          

          

          45.
          Scarlett walks back and faces him. He glances aside at Duke
          who is loving this. Ripcord readies the pistol. Scarlett
          darts left. He shoots and misses. She darts right. He
          misses.

          DUKE
          C'mon, Rip.
          Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best. But Scarlett
          us too fast. Ducking and weaving around Ripcord, as nimble
          as a cat. Five more shots miss her. And now Ripcord's
          feeling the pressure. He waits for her to move. Fires. She
          leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath.
          He fires again as she lands, ducks under it and rolls up to
          him. He fires his last bolt point blank. She catches it in
          her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber. Slamming
          her body up against his. Right hand behind his head, left
          hand holding the bolt. Their faces close. Lips closer.
          Ripcord's eyes on hers as he whispers:

          SCARLETT
          Guess you didn't really want me
          that bad, rip.
          She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go. As she
          walks away, Scarlett casually tosses the ARROW, it hits the
          ground and EXPLODES. Ripcord and Duke jump back. Ripcord
          glances at the underside of the pistol's magazine. Three
          words: "CAUTION: LIVE BOLTS".
          Both men watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the
          course, awestruck. Breaker walks by eating a burrito and
          watching his bio-rhythm display.

          BREAKER
          Aw, Ripcord's heart just skipped a
          beat. Isn't that sweet?

          EXT. THE PIT - DESER - DUSK

          The sun is sinking, turning the dunes a brilliant orange.

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          Security works a console in the Security Room. Their
          infrared monitors show a HERDSMAN AND HIS CAMELS walking
          across the desert dunes. A Technician taps some keys and an
          X-RAY IMAGE shows the skeletal structures of the herdsman and
          his camels.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          EXT. THE PIT - DESERT - NIGHT

          The HERDSMAN walks across the desert with his CAMELS under a
          FULL MOON and a field of glittering stars. All of a sudden,
          MULTIPLE MOUNDS OF SAND whip past his feet, almost knocking
          him over. He stares at them as they abruptly disappear
          deeper under the sand, like diving submarines.

          INT. MOLE POD - UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

          Ana drives the lead MOLE POD, an oblong-shaped digging device
          that is just large enough for her to fit inside. She watches
          her HUD relay information about her angle of decent and her
          distance to the target. Thirty yards...twenty yards...ten...

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

          A light flashes on the console in the security room.

          SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1
          Sensors detecting seismic activity
          to the southwest. Probably just a
          tremor, but have a team check it.

          INT. TRAINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Ripcord and the other Joes watch as Duke and Snake-Eyes
          circle one another with special ELECTRIFIED PUGIL STICKS.
          Duke thrusts with a standard bayonet style move, Snake-Eyes
          side steps it, spins his pugil stick above his head and
          brings it down on Duke's head with a sword-like stroke. A
          CRACKLING SHOCK is delivered and Duke goes down. The Joes
          grimace, feeling Duke's pain. Snake-Eyes turns away, done
          with him. Duke pops back up again.

          DUKE
          Again.
          They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified
          pugil sticks crackling and sparking. Duke spins and attempts
          a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move. Snake-Eyes
          blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down
          hard before finishing him with another SPARKING HIT. Again,
          the Joes react. Snake-Eyes turns away. Duke shakes it off
          and pops to his feet once more.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Again.

          

          

          

          

          47.
          Snake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now. This
          time after the high blows are parried, Snake-Eyes tries the
          sweep. Duke jumps it, rolls, comes up behind Snake-Eyes and
          STRIKES. Snake-Eyes barely blocks it. They trade half a
          dozen blows, the electricity popping and crackling before
          Snake-Eyes tries a finishing blow. Duke stuffs it with his
          stick and tackles Snake-Eyes. They fall to the ground, both
          receiving JOLTS. They go eye-to-eye. It wasn't pretty, but
          Duke is getting effective. Snake-Eyes pops to his feet.
          This time he offers a hand to pull Duke up. Across the room,
          Hawk watches with approval.

          INT. THE PIT'S GENERATOR STATION - NIGHT

          The huge drill bit of Ana's mole machine bursts out of the
          reinforced clay wall, it opens and retracts, Ana rolls out
          and drops to the ground. Another huge drill bursts out, it
          retracts and opens and Storm Shadow drops to the ground.
          They look around. They're between the clay wall and the
          ELECTRIFIED POWER GRID FENCE of the Pit's generator station.

          ANA
          The foundation of this fence is a
          hundred feet deep. No going under.
          Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the wall.
          And then there's a crashing sound as one of the wall girders
          bends, obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it.
          Ana can hear the engine grind to a halt.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          If we don't get him out he'll
          suffocate.
          Storm Shadow gives her a look: Like I care?

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Just thought I'd mention it.

          STORM SHADOW
          All that matters is the mission.
          Ana pulls out a hi-tech SCANNING DEVICE which shoots out six
          STEEL BLUE BEAMS in a 360 DEGREE ARC, creating a DETAILED
          SCHEMATIC of the Pit, showing rooms and people moving about
          them. She points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence.
          Storm Shadow gestures to one of the Neo-Vipers. The Man
          immediately walks over and grabs the fence, electricity JOLTS
          him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily starts
          climbing the fence. The skin on his hands and arms starts to
          burn and bubble.

          

          

          

          

          48.

          STORM SHADOW (CONT'D)
          Acceptable collateral damage.

          ANA
          (trying to out-tough him)
          Is there any other?
          Near the top the Man finally falls backward and drops down
          dead. Storm Shadow nods to the next Viper. Without
          hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence. He is
          immediately JOLTED, but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling.
          This guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and
          crashes to the ground, then crawls over and pulls the OFF
          SWITCH, cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself.
          Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly scale the fence.

          INT. PIT BARRACKS - NIGHT

          An area where the Joe team chills. Duke and Ripcord enter,
          sore and worked over. They move to some couches. Heavy Duty
          grooves to the blasting Reggaeton classic "Salio El Sol".

          HEAVY DUTY
          You can learn a whole hell of a lot
          about a girl by the way she dances.
          Tell me I'm wrong Snake-Eyes.
          Snake-Eyes, sharpening his sword, barely looks up.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          See? He agrees.

          SCARLETT
          No, he doesn't. Do you?
          This time Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          See, he knows you have to listen to
          get to know someone. Right, Rip?
          Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear, glances over.

          RIPCORD
          What? You say something?
          Breaker sits at a chessboard. Heavy D sits across from him.

          BREAKER
          Sorry, Scarlett, gotta go with
          Heavy D on this one.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          49.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          Like my man says, get a girl on the
          floor, you don't just see how she
          moves, you get the smell of her.
          What biologists tell us is that the
          decision is made by he nose long
          before the rest of the body gets
          involved. It's a question of
          pheromones.

          SCARLETT
          You're going to teach me science?
          I read all about the positron
          emission tomography studies
          concerning sex pheromones when I
          was twelve. I'm just saying, it's
          not very romantic.
          Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett.

          RIPCORD
          Heavy told me she graduated college
          at twelve.
          No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          She's like a freaky genius. A
          deadly, freaky genius.

          DUKE
          You like her, I get it already.

          BREAKER
          (making a chess move)
          You can't learn this stuff in a
          book, Scarlett. You have to at
          least kiss a guy, before you're an
          expert on romance.
          The guys all laugh. Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow.

          SCARLETT
          Who am I shooting first?
          The laughter stops. Rip looks surprised.

          RIPCORD
          You haven't kissed anyone?
          Now Scarlett looks really furious. Rip instantly wishes he
          could take his words back. Duke just shakes his head.

          

          

          

          

          50.

          DUKE
          Really firing on all cylinders
          there, Rip.

          HEAVY DUTY
          All I know is, when the bass get's
          that booty shaking in the right
          way, I'm in the skin like a man
          named Flynn.
          Heavy Duty does a little freak dance. Scarlett makes a show
          of disgust. Ripcord watches Scarlett, then makes a decision.

          RIPCORD
          Hell with it.
          He strides across the room toward Scarlett. Breaker notices.

          BREAKER
          (to no one in particular)
          Into the Valley of Death rode the

          600.
          Heavy Duty looks at him, confused. Breaker nods to Ripcord,
          stopping near Scarlett's chair. Ripcord sees Snake-Eyes
          taking in his every move. Scarlett now has her nose in a
          book. Ripcord CLEARS HIS THROAT but she doesn't look up. He
          peers closer and WE SEE THE COVER, on which, though in
          English, is a damn near INDECIPHERABLE SCIENTIFIC TITLE.

          RIPCORD
          Beach reading, huh?
          She groans and lowers the book only slightly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the
          wrong foot...
          Without changing expression she goes back to her book.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Okay look, I'm attracted to you.
          And you, you're attracted to me.
          And him--
          (nods towards Snake-Eyes)
          The Zen Master, he creeps me out,
          but what I'm saying is--

          SCARLETT
          "We're attracted to one another."

          

          

          

          

          51.

          RIPCORD
          Thank you.

          SCARLETT
          That's what you're saying, not what
          I'm saying.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, what are you saying?

          SCARLETT
          Attraction is an emotion. Emotions
          are not based in science. And if
          you can't quantify or prove that
          something exists, well, in my
          mind... it doesn't.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, I'll get back to you on that.
          And he walks away scratching his head. Hawk steps in.
          Everyone comes to attention.

          HAWK
          Duke, You scored in the top half-
          percent of all people we've ever
          tested. Rip, well, if we average
          your scores with Duke's, you pass
          too. Welcome aboard,
          provisionally. But we still need
          to see if you pass muster in the
          field.
          Hawk gives them a nod. Duke and rip nod back with pride.

          HEAVY DUTY
          YO JOE! Welcome aboard, boyz!

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Ana, Storm Shadow and the Neo-Vipers creep down the hallway.
          Two GI JOE GUARDS come around a corner, before they can even
          react, Storm Shadow practically cuts them in two with his
          Katana sword. Ana Directs them down another hallway.

          INT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

          A DOOR reads, "General Hawk". Cover Girl walks up and
          knocks. As she waits, we see a SHADOW moving behind her.
          Hawk opens the door. She hands him her POWERBOOK and a

          STYLUS.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          COVER GIRL
          Sorry to disturb you, general.

          HAWK
          That's all right, Cover Girl. What
          am I signing now?
          Cover Girl GASPS, a KATANA BLADE piercing out through her
          chest. She drops lifelessly, revealing Storm Shadow behind
          her. Hawk grabs a PISTOL, but Storm Shadow flashes his two
          swords. One slices the barrel of the pistol clean off, the
          other buries itself in Hawk's gut. Hawk collapses. Ana
          steps forward and rips the General's SECURITY BADGE off his
          jacket. Hawk's eyes follow them as they leave. He glances
          at a RED BUTTON under his desk and struggles to reach it,
          giving everything he's got, until he finally hits the button.

          INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

          A KLAXON BLARES. Duke, Ripcord and all the Joes leap up.

          DUKE
          The warheads.
          They all rush out of the doors. Breaker stops to change a
          chess piece on the board before racing out.

          INT. MAIN VAULT - NIGHT

          Ana swipes Hawk's SECURITY BADGE across the lock of the VAULT
          DOOR. It opens.
          The weapons case sits on a table. She opens the case to
          check that the four warheads are inside, they shine on her
          glasses.

          INT. MAIN VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

          Duke and Ripcord reach the main vault, armed only with their
          pistols. They find the INNER VAULT DOOR ajar. They
          approach, pushing back the door to discover that the place is
          empty and the weapons case is gone.

          DUKE
          They can't be far.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          INT. URBAN AREA - NIGHT

          Some of the Neo-Vipers now reach the MOLE PODS and begin
          prepping them for escape. BOOM! A GRENADE slams into them,
          killing them and destroying the pods. It's Heavy Duty with
          his "MPL". Ana enters the room and quick-draws her PULSE
          PISTOL and blasts away. Heavy Duty dives behind cover, which
          is blown away, knocking him out cold.
          Storm Shadow examines the ruined MOLE PODS, glancing around,
          his eyes falling on a pair of "ARCLIGHT" JET PACKS mounted on
          a wall rack nearby. Storm Shadow strides to the nearest one
          and puts it on. Ana heads after him, still carrying the
          case. Suddenly, Duke and Ripcord rush up behind them, guns
          raised.

          DUKE
          Put the case down, Ana,
          Rip trains his gun on Storm Shadow.

          RIPCORD
          And you get out of that...thing.
          Stalemate. Storm Shadow doesn't move. Ana turns and looks
          at Duke. Sets the case down, her voice is gentle.

          ANA
          Fine. Done.
          Then she takes a step toward Duke.

          DUKE
          Stop, Ana. Stop right there.
          But she doesn't. She just keeps slowly moving toward him.

          ANA
          You can't shoot me, can you?

          DUKE
          I will if I have to.

          ANA
          Deep down, you're still the same
          man I fell in love with.

          DUKE
          Don't force this, Ana.

          

          

          

          

          54.

          ANA
          What could have been, right, Duke?
          You beside your best man. Me
          walking down the aisle.

          RIPCORD
          Don't listen to her, Duke.
          (a thought)
          Was I really going to be your best
          man?

          DUKE
          (cocking the pistol)
          Don't make me do this god-damnit!

          ANA
          "Don't make me do this?" A
          recurring theme in your life, right
          Duke?
          She takes another step. Duke levels his pistol right at her
          forehead. Storm Shadow flinches. Duke gives him a glance.

          DUKE
          Move and I'll blow her away.
          (to Ripcord)
          Get the briefcase.
          Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the
          trigger. Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves
          slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase. Ana is now an inch
          from the extended barrel. Ana and Duke are close enough to
          feel each other's breath. Their eyes lock.

          ANA
          Do it, Duke. .You already killed
          me once.
          And in Duke's eyes we see him falter, just a bit. Ripcord
          passes Ana, and wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at
          Duke's pistol. AN ERRANT SHOT GOES OFF. Storm Shadow lunges
          at ripcord, SLICING his pistol in half with one sword and
          about to kill him with the other.
          When suddenly, Snake-Eyes lunges INTO FRAME. CLANG! Snake-
          Eyes' KATANA BLADE saves Ripcord's life by a half inch.
          The rest of the Neo-Vipers arrive and immediately open fire,
          pinning both Duke and Ripcord down. All hell breaks loose.
          Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow lunge at one another, swords
          flashing at impossible speeds, then they lock swords. Face-
          to-face, staring hard into each other's eyes.

          

          

          

          

          55.
          Snake-Eyes glances at Storm Shadow's right forearm, spotting
          the same RED MARKINGS of his ninja clan underneath his suit
          sleeve. This shocks the hell out of Snake-Eyes. Storm
          Shadow smiles.

          STORM SHADOW

          (CYNICAL)
          Hello brother.
          Snake-Eyes looks shocked. Storm Shadow uses the moment to
          elbow him in the face, knocking him hard to the ground. Ana
          grabs the weapons case as Scarlett rushes in, aiming her

          CROSSBOW PISTOL.

          SCARLETT
          I believe you've got my luggage.
          Ana stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL. Her
          shot tears the CROSSBOW PISTOL out of Scarlett's hands.
          Ana's got her dead-to-rights until Scarlett triggers her CAMO-
          SUIT, melting into nothing right in front of Ana.
          Ana doesn't spot the RIPPLES OF AIR around her until she's
          stuck hard. The case goes flying. Another SMACK and her
          pistol is knocked free. Ana grabs a second pistol, but
          that's just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped.
          Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but
          Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her.
          Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers. Storm Shadow
          climbs back into the Arclight. Looking at ana as she falls
          near a vehicle on the blocks. Ana grabs an OIL PAN and
          flings the oil, which sprays over everything, including
          Scarlett, making her visible. Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks
          her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of
          her.
          Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air,
          powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine
          pack. He quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana
          by her arm, pulling her along. Ana grabs the weapons case
          and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing
          pad. The battle raging below them.
          Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the
          next level. Heavy Duty, now back in action, takes out the
          last of the Neo-Vipers. Snake-Eyes checks on Scarlett who's
          nursing her neck.

          INT. ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          Ana climbs to Storm Shadow as the rocket up to the SECURITY
          ROOM WINDOW and BLAST it out of their way. SHATTER CITY.

          

          

          

          

          56.

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          They fly into the security room and quickly dispatch the few
          technicians still alive. Ana his the large switch on the
          console and the huge door begins to spiral open. She jumps
          back into Storm Shadow's arms and they blast back out--

          EXT. ENTRANCE - THE PIT - NIGHT

          --and fly up through the hole where their Typhoon gunship
          rockets up. They fly in through a door as four Joe ANTI-
          AIRCRAFT TURRETS spring out of the sand, firing away at the
          Typhoon as it speeds away into the dark desert night...

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAWN

          Dawn light shimmers across the reflecting pool, the Lincoln
          Memorial, the Washington Monument.

          SUPER: WASHINGTON D.C.

          INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAWN

          The AMERICAN PRESIDENT quickly but quietly closes the door to
          his bedroom, throwing on a robe, he charges down a corridor,
          trailed by his STAFF and BODYGUARDS. One of the staffers
          hands the President a report which he skims through.

          PRESIDENT
          How many warheads?

          STAFFER #1
          Four, Mr. President.

          PRESIDENT
          Any threats? Any demands?

          STAFFER #1
          None so far, sir.

          STAFFER #2
          We take this to mean the terrorists
          are unfocused, no clear goals.
          The President stops, glancing gravely back at his staff.

          PRESIDENT
          No, .it means they're going to
          use them.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          In the shadowy operating chamber, the Doctor approaches
          Zartan who sits on a gurney, scanning his PDA. Dozens of
          SMART ROBOTS warm up as the Doctor flicks on switches.

          THE DOCTOR
          Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?

          ZARTAN
          This is going to be the achievement
          of a lifetime.

          THE DOCTOR
          For you and me both.

          ZARTAN
          Eighteen months of studying the
          subject, learning the mannerisms,
          adopting his eating habits, losing
          sixty percent of my muscle mas...

          THE DOCTOR
          Your commitment has been inspiring.
          McCullen enters.

          MCCULLEN
          Gentlemen. About to get under way?
          Zartan raises his PDA.

          ZARTAN
          Once the ledgers are all square.

          MCCULLEN
          Check your account.
          Zartan checks the PDA. McCullen shakes his head.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          It's always about the money.

          ZARTAN
          It's a useful tool. You should
          understand that. Ah! The transfer
          just hit my account.
          Zartan puts the PDA aside, leans back on the gurney and

          CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES.

          

          

          

          

          59.

          ZARTAN (CONT'D)
          Let's do this.
          The Doctor straps Zartan down, then starts the SMART ROBOTS
          which converge on Zartan, injecting his body with dozens of
          long needles. He remains conscious, not feeling any pain.
          WE ZOOM into a LARGE NEEDLE which OPENS an INCISION behind
          his right ear. The needle feeds thousands of tiny NANO-MITES
          into Zartan's head. Zartan's eyes bulge, he starts to SCREAM
          and fight his restraints as the nano-mites begin to reshape
          his appearance, reforming facial bones and changing the
          texture and elasticity of his skin and even changing the
          color of his eyes. The Doctor grins proudly. McCullen looks
          disturbed.

          INT. URBAN AREA - THE PIT - DAY

          Joes are busy cleaning up the mess. Snake-Eyes sits by
          himself, hasn't moved in several hours. A thousand yard
          stare in his eyes. AND WE FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. A DRIZZLING SAIGON ALLEY - NIGHT

          A TEN YEAR OLD FRENCH ORPHAN BOY, cold from the rain and
          desperately hungry, scavenges for food in a garbage can, he
          looks up and notices a warm light coming from the other side
          of a wall and gate MARKED WITH RED CLAN MARKINGS.
          INSIDE THE TEMPLE: Young Snake Eyes sneaks in through the
          Kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter. As he
          takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the RED
          CLAN MARKINGS on his forearm, it's a young Storm Shadow,
          healthy, wealthy, and well fed.

          YOUNG STORM SHADOW
          Thief !
          He picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake-
          Eyes, who blocks the strike with the rice pot. They fight
          fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of utensils and
          furniture. Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but Storm
          Shadow's classic training gives him the edge. He finally
          traps Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his
          face. He starts to choke Snake-Eyes with his foot ...

          HARD MASTER (O.S.)
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Enough! Storm Shadow!
          A Ninja Master steps forward. Storm Shadow turns to him.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          YOUNG STORM SHADOW
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Father, he was stealing. We need to
          call the magistrate.

          HARD MASTER
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          He is hungry. We need to invite him
          in and show him the way.

          STORM SHADOW
          He's a cur! A Frenchie!

          HARD MASTER
          He doesn't fight like one.
          The two young warriors glare at one another.

          HARD MASTER (CONT'D)
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Now what shall be your clan name?
          Snake-Eyes glares up at Storm Shadow, narrowing his eyes
          furiously. Hard Master just smiles, AHl
          AND WE FLASH BACK TO: Snake-Eyes in the motor pool, he stands
          up and walk off...

          INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

          Battered and bruised, Scarlett hurriedly enters the barracks.
          Checks around to see that she's alone. Then she heads for a
          mirror over one of the sinks, peeling back her collar to
          check the CHOKE MARKS on her neck. Her hands are trembling.
          She turns on the water and cleans her face with a WASH CLOTH.
          Ripcord enters the barracks behind. Like Scarlett, he looks
          around to see if he's alone. He catches Scarlett looking at
          him in the mirror, as if he's unwanted. Then he notices the
          choke marks. He is genuinely concerned.

          RIPCORD
          Jesus, you okay?

          SCARLETT
          I'm fine.

          RIPCORD
          You're not fine, let me look at
          that.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          SCARLETT
          I looked at it, it's fine.

          RIPCORD
          Take it easy, just trying to help.

          SCARLETT
          I know what you're trying to do.

          RIPCORD
          And what is that exactly?

          SCARLETT
          I don't have time for this.

          RIPCORD
          You know, not every guy you meet is
          an asshole. You do know that, don't
          you?
          Scarlett stops and returns to the sink, he ignores her,
          cleaning the blood off his face. She softens.

          SCARLETT
          It's not you, I... I didn't really
          want anyone to... see me in here.

          RIPCORD
          Why not?

          SCARLETT
          I don't know. All the people we
          lost last night. General Hawk... My
          neck is not that important.

          RIPCORD
          You almost died. You're allowed to
          be concerned.

          SCARLETT
          First fight I've lost since I was a
          kid. My father would be... he was
          my instructor.

          RIPCORD
          Think he's be disappointed.

          SCARLETT
          He taught me to win.

          RIPCORD
          I don't know how you teach anybody
          to win at everything every time.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          62.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          But I do know you can teach someone
          to get up when they get knocked
          down.
          Ripcord turn her gently in the mirror.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Look at you. Still here. Maybe this
          is what he wanted you to learn.
          Scarlett stares at her reflection briefly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          But of course, that would be an
          emotional response, one that can't
          be explained or quantified.
          Ripcord turns and heads for the door. Scarlett watches him.

          SCARLETT
          We're not a couple. Snake-Eyes and
          me. We're... close, he's like a
          brother, but... we're not a couple.
          Ripcord looks back at her, nods, then walks on out.

          INT. MEDICAL RECOVERY WING - DAY

          Hawk is hooked up to a LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE. Duke sits
          nearby, his shoulder being bandaged by a Medical Officer. WE
          PUSH IN ON Duke's eyes, staring into oblivion, AND FLASHBACK

          CUT TO: HAWK'S FACE RIGHT AT CAMERA:

          HAWK
          Can you kill her?
          And then WE FLASHBACK TO: Ana strangling Scarlett, a smile on
          her face. Squeezing harder, harder. Pure evil.

          DOCTOR (V.0.)

          (PRELAP)
          That ought to hold you.

          INT. MEDICAL WING - DAY

          Duke "comes to" as the Doctor finishes and walks away. Duke
          takes a breath, looks to Hawk in his bed, then stands and
          walks over. He stares down at Hawk, then, a promise--

          DUKE
          Graveyard dead.

          

          

          

          

          63.

          INT. MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Duke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Heavy Duty stare at
          some next-gen computerized ultra-sound PHOTOSTATS of a dead
          Neo-Viper. Snake-Eyes points in question to an area.

          SCARLETT
          Nano-mites. I wrote my thesis on
          the theory behind them at Oxford.
          They've been surgically implanted
          behind the ear, all programmed to
          accomplish different tasks.

          DUKE
          Like what?

          SCARLETT
          Theoretically, the possibilities
          are endless. Increase their speed,
          agility, resilience. You program,
          they perform. That's the genius of
          nanotechnology, it can do pretty
          much whatever you want it to.

          DUKE
          Mind control?

          SCARLETT
          I don't see why not.

          INT. CORRIDOR - THE PIT - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord move with the others through a corridor.

          DUKE
          Their weaponry, financing, intel,
          it has to be McCullen. Doing an
          inside job on his own warheads.

          SCARLETT
          You may be right. Maybe he needed
          NATO to pay for his R D.

          RIPCORD
          The weapons case!
          Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Remember he had us open the case
          for him. Remember that?

          

          

          

          

          64.

          SCARLETT
          What about it?

          RIPCORD
          I'll bet that code he gave us like
          re-activated the tracking beacon or
          something.
          Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense.

          DUKE
          And who says you're not a thinker.
          All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath.

          BREAKER
          I think I found her...

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Breaker leads the group into the control room where a WEDDING
          PHOTO OF ANA AND DeCobray is up on screen. Duke stares at the
          photo, gazing at her face. Ripcord sees her and knows, too.

          DUKE
          Yeah, you found her all right.

          BREAKER
          Her name is Ana DeCobray now,
          Baroness if you're feeling formal.

          RIPCORD
          Wow, she traded up, huh?
          (off Duke's look)
          I mean... financially.

          DUKE
          Who is he?

          BREAKER
          Baron DeCobray. Big shot French
          scientist. Runs a lab in Paris.

          SCARLETT
          Lab?
          Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a
          huge PARTICLE ACCELERATOR along with some other scientists.

          BREAKER
          Particle accelerator.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          SCARLETT
          They're gonna use him to weaponize
          the warheads.

          DUKE
          That's where she's going.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Who likes croissants?

          EXT. BLACK SKY - NIGHT

          And then a lighted aircraft in the distance approaches at
          Mach three. It's the Howler.

          INT. THE HOWLER - NIGHT

          The Joes are silent, eyes ahead. Scarlett shares a smile with
          Ripcord, next to her, Across from them Duke watches, almost
          smiles, then lays back his head and closes his eyes. AND WE

          FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - DAY

          CAMERA PANS AROUND a village choked by thick jungle as
          EXPLOSIONS erupt in SLO-MO and a BLACKHAWK circles, ROTORS
          beating hypnotically, giving the images a dreamlike quality.

          INT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER, DAWN - FLASHBACK

          Duke, Ripcord, Rex, and the rest of an insertion team, sit
          with their backs against the chopper walls.

          DUKE
          Per the briefing, we fast rope in,
          form up and assault the main lab...
          (a glance at Rex)
          Rex--uh, .the science officer,
          stays back with Fireteam Alpha
          until Bravo enters and secures the
          building. Alpha holds the perimeter
          while science officer secures the
          WMDs. Five minutes before
          extraction and the airstrike.
          The squad nods.
          Duke looks to Rex again. Rex is sweating, trying not to show
          it. Duke hands him a piece of gum.

          

          

          

          

          66.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Double Bubble?
          Rex takes it. Duke blows a bubble, smiles at Rex.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Always helps me. You good?

          REX
          (weak smile back)
          Yeah...
          They chew their gum.

          EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - FLASHBACK - DAY

          DOWN IN THE VILLAGE: Duke leads a frontal assault of the main
          building. They take fire from some GUARDS, but put them down.
          Other GUARDS flee. The way to the door is cleared. Duke gives
          hand signals along with his commands.

          DUKE
          Go, Bravo.
          Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the door of the building. They
          disappear inside.
          Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his
          hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to him puts a hand on his
          shoulder. Duke scans the treeline for any treats.
          One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals "ALL
          CLEAR." Duke double taps Rex on the shoulder.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          You're good to go, Rex. You don't
          find it in four minutes, get out of
          there, because that house won't be
          standing in five. I already called
          for the air strike.
          Rex nods. Duke gives him a smile. Rex takes off and runs low
          to the door, entering the house. Duke watches him go, then
          looks back to the jungle and hears the WHUMP of mortars. Duke
          takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then the
          mortar rounds start to hit.
          The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke,
          Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover.
          We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle,
          firing. Duke and Ripcord pop up and return fire.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          RIPCORD
          I've gotta level with ya!

          DUKE
          I hate it when you level with me.

          RIPCORD
          Gonna be a long five minutes.
          Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing. Then, in the
          distance, RUMBLING coming from the sonic roar of JETS.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          I love that sound...
          But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face.

          DUKE
          No, no, no... It's too soon.
          ANGLE ON: The F-16s in formation streaking toward them across
          the sky. Duke looks back at the main building.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Rex.
          Duke runs for the building. Tracer fire and mortar explosions
          all around him. Then the whistle of a bunker buster. Duke
          dives and BOOM! The building is flattened by the bomb. Duke
          is tossed through the air like a rag doll. Lands hard, barely
          registers the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles
          toward the smoking. Flaming rubble that was the building.
          The Blackhawk comes sweeping low, ready for extraction, the
          tracer fire and explosions intensify. Black smoke washes over
          Duke. Ripcord finds him in the debris.

          RIPCORD
          Blackhawk's waiting. Come on, we've
          got wounded! And incoming enemy!
          Lots of 'em!

          DUKE
          I can't.

          RIPCORD
          Nothing you can do. Come on...!
          Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from
          the ruins of the house.

          

          

          

          

          68.

          INT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER - FLASHBACK

          TIGHT ON Duke's haunted, soot-streaked face as his eyes take
          on a thousand-yard stare. AND WE CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT:

          INT. HOWLER - NIGHT

          Duke is wide awake, his eyes have on a thousand-yard stare...

          EXT. PARIS - FRANCE - DAY

          Paris by day, the Eiffel Tower in all her glory.

          EXT. GUARD SHED - LABORATORY - DAY

          Ana's SCARAB ATTACK TRUCK pulls up to a GUARD SHED outside a
          large building which is surrounded by an ELECTRIFIED FENCE. A
          SECURITY GUARD steps out of the shed and taps on the driver's
          window. The Neo-Viper behind the wheel lowers the BACKSEAT
          WINDOW, revealing Ana and Storm Shadow in the back. The guard
          smiles at Ana. They speak in French, subtitled.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Good Morning. Baroness.

          ANA
          Good morning. Gene. My husband's
          expecting me.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Absolument.
          The Security Guard opens the ELECTRONIC GATE and the Scarab
          drives up to the building.

          INT. FOYER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Two SECURITY GUARDS look up from their desks as Ana and Storm
          Shadow stride through the DOORS with two Neo-Vipers. Storm
          Shadow throws something. Both guards fall dead. THROWING
          STARS in their heads. The Neo-Vipers steal behind the desk,
          throw a switch, open a LOCKED DOOR for Ana and Storm Shadow.

          INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Ana and Storm Shadow enter a colossal chamber which is all
          but consumed by the PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

          

          

          

          

          69.
          LAB TECHNICIANS swarm all over it, taking readings and making
          adjustments, under the eyes of DeCobray who sits at a control
          station surrounded by monitors. Ana gives the weapons case to
          Storm Shadow who hangs back as she walks up to her husband.

          DECOBRAY
          Ana...?

          ANA
          I need you to do something for me
          and I don't have much time.

          DECOBRAY
          (sees Storm Shadow)
          Who is this?
          She beckons Storm Shadow who sets the weapons case down on
          DeCobray's desk, opening it up to reveal the four NANOTECH
          WARHEADS and their launchers. DeCobray stares, bewildered.

          DECOBRAY (CONT'D)
          I don't understand... what are these
          things? What's going on?

          ANA
          They're warheads, dear. And I need
          you to weaponize them for me...
          (looking around)
          .or we'll kill everyone in here.
          DeCobray stares at her, shocked. He looks at Storm Shadow who
          removes a GLOCK PISTOL from his belt and shoots a TECHNICIAN.
          Chaos erupts. DeCobray shouts to the room, calming the others
          somewhat. He stares at Ana and Storm Shadow, terrified.

          DECOBRAY
          This is a civilian laboratory. We
          don't have the correct programming
          protocols for weaponizing...

          ANA
          The protocols are in the case.
          (he hesitates)
          I told you, I don't have much time.
          DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case.

          EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          A BRAWLER charges through the streets. On the outside it
          looks like your Uncle's R.V, but inside it's all next-gen.

          

          

          

          

          70.

          INT. BRAWLER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Heavy Duty drives the Brawler while Breaker mans a hi-tech
          terminal next to him. In the back, Snake-Eyes loads his guns
          while Scarlett, Duke, and Ripcord put on ACCELERATOR SUITS.

          SCARLETT
          Heavy D and Breaker will stay in
          the Brawler, watch our back. The
          rest of us will break into the lab
          with the accelerator suits. Once
          the warheads are weaponized,
          they'll be extremely volatile. We
          can't afford to let any of them go
          off inside the city.
          Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes.

          RIPCORD
          What about you? Don't you get a
          suit?
          Snake-Eyes just looks at him, "Are you kidding me?"

          SCARLETT
          He doesn't need one.

          INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY

          A TREMENDOUS WHINE echoes through the chamber as the particle
          accelerator come to life, HUMMING evenly. Storm Shadow backs
          up a little. Ana glances at him. He shrugs, what? Technicians
          quickly finish up and back away from the accelerator.

          DECOBRAY
          Firing.
          DeCobray hits a switch. The PARTICLE ACCELERATOR charges and
          begins hurling atoms through miles and miles of underground
          tunnels. Inside the accelerator, the four warheads begin to
          spin in a GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER -- then, as the power grows,
          they begin to rise, each one hovering as they spin.
          Ana and Storm Shadow watch with mild curiosity as the noise
          inside the chamber builds. The atoms catapulting faster and
          faster through the tunnels, bombarding the warheads again and
          again. Until finally, a LOUD BOOM rings out. And the warheads
          slowly sink back down and stop spinning.
          DeCobray keys another button and the GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER
          emerges from the accelerator.

          

          

          

          

          71.
          Technicians open the chamber and very carefully remove the
          warheads, returning them to their case. Storm Shadow locks
          the case and picks it up.

          DECOBRAY (CONT'D)
          Careful... they're alive.

          ANA
          Thank you, Leon.

          DECOBRAY
          I think I have never seen the face
          of evil until I looked at you now.
          Ana looks at him and falters, something in his words piercing
          her hard veneer. She feels Storm Shadow watching her and
          with a flick of her eyes, the walls go up again. She drop a
          SEALED ENVELOPE on DeCobray's desk and heads for the door.

          ANA
          Adieu.
          DeCobray watches her go, then opens the envelope. We see the
          LARGE HEADER printed on the first page: "ACCORD DE DIVORCE".

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - LABORATORY - DAY

          The Brawler races up towards the lab, they see it out their
          forward windows.

          HEAVY DUTY
          There it is.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - DAY

          Ana and Storm Shadow emerge from the lab and climb into the
          back of the Scarab as the two Neo-Vipers climb in the front.

          INT. FOYER - DAY

          DeCobray stumbles out to the foyer, finds the two Security
          Guards dead, and quickly picks up a phone.

          EXT. GUARD SHED - DAY

          The Security Guard in the guard shed puts down his phone and
          glances at the oncoming Scarab just as a Neo-Viper leans out
          with his PULSE RIFLE and blasts the whole shed to pieces.
          The Scarab crashes right out the gate.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER/SCARAB - DAY

          At the same time, the Brawler reaches the laboratory and
          there's a split second where both sides see each other in
          their windows. Duke and Ana lock eyes. Snake-Eyes and Storm
          Shadow do the same.

          BREAKER
          That's them!
          Snake-Eyes is already moving, lunging out a SIDE DOOR onto
          the street as the Brawler still moves, running right at the
          Scarab which turns to get away. Scarlett immediately follows
          him out, landing in a roll with her accelerator suit.
          Ana leans out of her window and fires her PULSE PISTOLS at
          the Brawler, keeping Duke and Rip inside. Then she fires at
          Snake-Eyes and Scarlett. Snake-Eyes dives, but the blasts
          nail Scarlett. She crashes hard. Snake-Eyes glances at her.

          SCARLETT
          Keep going!
          With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back
          of the vehicle as it tears away. The Brawler stops right
          next to Scarlett, out of breath, her accelerator suit

          FRITZING.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          (to Duke and Ripcord)
          Don't worry about me, go and help
          Snake-Eyes!
          Duke doesn't need to be told twice. He leaps out and runs
          after the Scarab. Rips starts to follow, Breaker grabs him.

          BREAKER
          Careful. They're worth millions of
          dollars... each.

          RIPCORD
          Millions of dollars, got it.
          He promptly trips and crashes to the pavement. Picks himself
          up. Gets hit by a car. Picks himself up again.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          (to Driver)
          Sorry! Excusem moil
          (to a stunned Breaker)
          Won't happen again.

          

          

          

          

          73.
          Then Rip hauls-ass after Duke.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          An ACCORDIAN BUS passes casually through an intersection.
          All of a sudden, the Scarab bursts through it, ripping it in
          two and barrelling on down the busy street. Snake-Eyes is
          still barely clinging to the back.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Breaker watches the two halves of the bus whirl around on his
          SATELLITE VIEW as Heavy Duty drives through the city streets.

          BREAKER
          Christ, they just shot right
          through a bus!

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

           Duke and Rip charge after the Scarab. Their speedometers
          reading 15mph...then 30mph...then 40mph. they leap over and
          around speeding cars and trucks.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          The Scarab smashes through any vehicle in its path, leaving a
          trail of destruction for Duke and Ripcord to leap over or
          dart around in their suits. Ana and Storm Shadow hear Snake-
          Eyes on the roof and drop their windows and lean out and
          shoot at him. But Snake-Eyes quickly clambers down the side
          of the vehicle, escaping their shots by disappearing beneath
          the undercarriage.
          And that's when Ana sees Duke and Rip following. She sits
          back down inside and keys a button on a console.
          SIDE PANELS slide open on the outside of the Scarab to reveal
          two MISSILES, one on each side. They fire.
          The MISSILES streak back towards Duke and Ripcord. No time
          to get out of the way, they dive and roll in various
          directions, extreme kinetic energy hurling them forward. The
          two missiles whip between them and detonate, one on a PARKING
          OFFICER'S CAR and the other on a BILLBOARD. The EXPLOSION
          from the car knocks them down. The Scarab tears away around
          a corner.

          

          

          

          

          74.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          They see Snake-Eyes on their monitors in the Brawler.

          BREAKER
          They're turning the corner. Go
          through that building at 6 o'clock!

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord see the building in front of them.

          RIPCORD
          There's no door!

          BREAKER'S VOICE
          Make one!
          Duke charges directly at the building. Ripcord reluctantly
          following as Duke smashes through the wall into...

          INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - PARIS - DAY

          A crowded bar. Neither of them slow for a second. Duke
          bolts through. Rip grabs a MARTINI, opens his visor, downs
          the drink, then places the empty glass on the tray of a
          stunned waitress. Behind her a sign reads: "DRINK
          RESPONSIBLY". Duke and Ripcord SMASH through the opposite
          wall...

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

          .back out onto the city streets where they turn and level
          their WRIST-MOUNTED ROCKETS at...nothing. A puzzling beat.
          And then the Scarab thunders up behind them at full speed.
          Ripcord dives out of the way just in time. Duke has no such
          luck. He spins and catches the FRONT GRILL, digging his feet
          into the road in an attempt to slow the Scarab down. But the
          Scarab now angles towards a busy intersection, threatening to
          crush DUKE in the criss-crossing traffic.
          Duke throws himself onto the hood just as an SUV CRASHES into
          the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage.
          Duke tumbles up onto the roof. A PULSE CANNON pops up. Duke
          dives off the back as the weapon fires. He tumbles to the
          pavement as Ripcord speeds up to him, firing his WRIST-
          MOUNTED ROCKETS at the Scarab. Duke fires with him.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Their rockets nail the Scarab and knock out the PULSE CANNON.
          BOOM! But its armor saves the vehicle.
          INSIDE: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around. Storm
          Shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own ACCELERATOR
          SUITS. Hands it to Ana.

          STORM SHADOW
          Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy
          if I let you die.
          Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in.

          ANA
          How thoughtful.

          INT. BRAWLER - DAY

          On the monitors, Scarlett and Breaker watch the Scarab via
          Snake-Eyes speeding through the streets.

          SCARLETT
          Look at the moves they're making,
          they're heading somewhere.
          Breaker widens the map, plotting a route.

          BREAKER
          This's their route from the lab.
          On the screen, they see the lab, the current position of the
          Scarab, and what lies just ahead. . .the Eiffel Tower.

          SCARLETT

          (REALIZING)
          Metal... Oh God...

          EXT. SCARAB/STREETS - DAY

          Snake-Eyes is now desperately clinging to the undercarriage.
          Duke and Rip are catching up behind him.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Guys, you have to stop them.

          DUKE
          Yeah, we're working on it.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          I mean right now. They're going to
          detonate one of the warheads on the
          Eiffel Tower.
          Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast.

          RIPCORD
          Oh, man...
          Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and
          fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT TIRES, which
          promptly rip to shreds. The Neo-Viper loses control of the
          vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks.
          Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes
          into garbage cans just as a METRO TRAIN barrels into the
          Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air, hood-over-tailpipe.
          Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop. Duke manages
          to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of
          the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and
          PLUNGES headlong into a window on the side of the train...

          INT. METRO-RAIL TRAIN - DAY

          .flying across the aisle, whipping past a group of stunned
          morning COMMUTERS, and smashing out through the far window...

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          The Scarab, Duke and Rip all CRASH HARD to the pavement and
          tumble. Sparks and flame and flying metal everywhere. Duke
          and Rip finally stop tumbling, a hundred yards away from the
          wreck of the Scarab.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Scarlett, Heavy Duty and Breaker see this on their monitors.

          HEAVY DUTY/BREAKER
          Holy shit...

          SCARLETT

          (CRINGING)
          You guys okay?

          EXT. RAILWAY CROSSING - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord's visors lift, both looking a bit wigged.

          

          

          

          

          77.

          DUKE
          What happened to you?

          RIPCORD
          I went through the train. What
          happened to you?

          DUKE
          I jumped over it.

          RIPCORD
          You can do that?

          DUKE
          Yeah, you didn't know?
          INSIDE THE SCARAB: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead. Storm
          Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in
          her red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons
          case and he and Ana leap out.
          Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls
          out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana
          emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          C'mon!
          Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them.

          EXT. EIFFEL TOWER - DAY

          HUNDREDS OF TOURISTS swarm around the south base of the tower
          to buy their tickets and start their tours. Storm Shadow and
          Ana burst through them, slamming past SECURITY GUARDS as they
          bound onto the stairs. People scream at the sight of Ana.
          Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their
          Accelerator Suits like beings from another world. They spot
          Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them. The
          Security Guards draw their pistols and start SHOOTING at Duke
          and Ripcord. The BULLETS ping off their suits.

          RIPCORD
          (to Duke)
          How do you say "we're the good
          guys" in French?
          Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up
          under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey.

          

          

          

          

          78.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs
          and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the
          opposite side of the floor. Another SECURITY GUARD draws a
          gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the
          man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing
          a step. The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs--
          --where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up. The
          avalanche of tourists slows their progress. Underneath the
          stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without
          a safety net. He makes it to the first floor and races after
          Ana and Storm Shadow.
          ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett's first
          out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her. All of them
          carrying weapons. The Security Guards instantly go on the
          defensive as they hurry up to the stairway. Guns go up.
          Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French.

          SCARLETT
          (French, subtitled)
          Don't shoot! We're a special anti-
          terrorist unit! There's a bomb up
          there!
          POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them.
          ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the
          main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow
          hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case
          and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH.
          Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top
          of the stairs behind. Ana rolls the warhead towards him
          while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's
          pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at
          Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the
          warhead.
          A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils.
          ON THE GROUND: Everyone hears the warhead detonate.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Duke and Ripcord freeze.
          ON THE SECOND FLOOR: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads out in
          all directions. Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and
          hits a button for the top. The elevator races upwards as
          everything else gets eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES. The
          floor begins to disappear. Tourists stampede towards the
          stairs. A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her MOTHER'S GRIP. The
          mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the
          railing.

          

          

          

          

          79.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her
          coming. Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in
          time. Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes.
          Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the
          tourists. He leaps up onto the iron lattice.

          RIPCORD
          Where you going?

          DUKE
          Each warhead has a kill switch.

          RIPCORD
          It's too late! We gotta get off
          this thing!

          DUKE
          Those nano-mites will level the
          entire city!
          Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator
          Suit. Rip things about following, but then looks at the
          little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes
          grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs.
          The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below them,
          Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police
          evacuate the Tower.
          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top.

          ANA
          (into mike)
          Be ready to pick up in thirty
          seconds.
          IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of
          the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening.
          ON THE TOWER: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES chasing
          him up. His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck
          just above him. The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION
          CANNONS at Duke, knocking him off the tower. He falls, but
          manages to catch the tower just below, the NANO-MITES almost
          on top of him now. The climbs even faster.
          ON THE TOP DECK: The elevator arrives. Ana and Storm Shadow
          calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers
          up beside them. Below them, Duke sees them board. The tower
          groans and wobbles. It's a long way down. Time has run out.
          Ana and Storm Shadow jump into the Typhoon.

          

          

          

          

          80.
          With the NANO-MITES at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps
          up off the side of the Tower, sailing up through the air and
          latching onto the SIDE DOOR of the Typhoon.
          IN THE TYPHOON: The gunship rocks with his sudden weight.
          Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing. Duke springs
          inside. He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL
          SWITCH from Ana, pressing the trigger.
          Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and fall to the
          ground around the Eiffel Tower.
          The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side.
          Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes
          down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of
          water. The shock on the faces of everyone around
          reverberates through the entire Joe team. Ripcord keeps his
          eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away. Breaker suddenly gets
          an idea.

          BREAKER
          Come on!
          He hauls-ass.

          INT. TYPHOON - DAY

          Ana looks at Duke, a pursed smile on her lips.

          ANA
          You just saved Paris.
          Storm Shadow is not happy at all, he TASERS Duke, who drops
          hard to the floor of the Typhoon.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          A crowd has gathered around the crashed Scarab. Heavy Duty
          yanks one of the dead Neo-Vipers out. Breaker yanks off the
          guy's HELMET then removes a needle-like PORT PLUG from his
          SURVEILLANCE SUIT. Scarlett moves into position to help him.
          Ripcord kneels down.

          RIPCORD
          What are you doing?

          BREAKER
          Plugging into his cerebral cortex.
          With a SICKENING CRUNCH, Breaker plunges the needle into the
          top of the Neo-Viper's head. Ripcord winces at the sight.

          

          

          

          

          81.

          SCARLETT
          The brain survives for a couple of
          minutes after death. We can read
          his most recent memories.

          RIPCORD
          Can you find Duke?

          BREAKER
          If this guy remembers the way home
          we can.
          INSERT: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker's HUD.
          Duke shooting him in the face, racing along the highway,
          driving the ARMORED CAR. As the images continue, we PUSH IN
          on the Neo-Viper's open eyes and CUT TO:

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen watching Breaker and Ripcord through the dead Neo-
          Viper's eyes on a screen. He turns to the Doctor urgently.

          MCCULLEN
          Destroy that unit immediately.
          The Doctor removes his PDA and taps a key to draw up the Neo-
          Viper's file. He clicks a button that reads "TERMINATE".

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          Instantly, the Neo-Viper's body snaps rigid and begins to
          shake. Everyone gets a shock. Backing up.

          HEAVY DUTY
          He's still alive!

          SCARLETT
          He's not alive.

          HEAVY DUTY
          You ever seen a dead guy do that?

          SCARLETT
          They activated a self-destruct.
          The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them. Thousands
          of NANO-MITES literally eating away at his flesh and bones.

          BREAKER
          Nano-mites!

          

          

          

          

          82.

          RIPCORD
          They're eating him!

          SCARLETT
          Hurry, Breaker!
          But the NANO-MITES are too fast. The Neo-Viper's legs are
          now gone. His chest and arms next. Breaker rapidly scans
          through the MEMORY FLASHES. But now the NANO-MITES consume
          his head.

          BREAKER

          NOW

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen watches Breaker's frantic face suddenly disappear on
          his screen. He gives the Doctor a smile.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Breaker looks crestfallen at the empty Neo-Viper suit in his
          arms. Ripcord kneels beside him, stunned and bereft.

          RIPCORD
          You did the best you could.

          BREAKER
          Relax, I got it.

          RIPCORD
          You got it?

          (CONFUSED)
          Well, what was the "NOO!" for?

          BREAKER
          That was for McCullen.
          There is the sound of weapons being raised. The team looks
          to see they are surrounded by FRENCH POLICE and PARATROOPERS.

          The Joes trade looks - rock and a hard place.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          We're not doing Duke a damned bit
          of good sitting here. If it was
          reversed, Duke would be kicking
          down every door between here and
          the freakin' moon 'til he found me.

          SCARLETT
          And we'll do the same for him as
          soon as we get out of here.
          She has a thought and turns to Breaker.

          and longitude.

          BREAKER

          SCARLETT
           Maybe it was the whole coordinate,

          Before the image went to
          snow,...it's the polar ice cap.
          RIP'S DOG TAGS hit the floor and slide to his feet. The Joes
          all look up to see several POLICE OFFICIALS looking at them.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          The Joes are led down a hallway.

          RIPCORD
          They did away with the guillotine,
          right?
          They arrive at a door. The door is opened to reveal a man in
          a wheelchair, back turned. When he spins around, it's Hawk.

          BREAKER
          General!
          Hawk just shakes his head and sighs heavily.

          INT. ROOM - LATER

          The Joes sit around the General, mid-discussion.

          HEAVY DUTY
          How long before we're released?

          HAWK
          The French government is allowing
          you to leave on the condition that
          none of you ever return. Other
          agencies will be handling this from
          here on.

          SCARLETT/RIPCORD
          What?!

          HAWK
          The heads of state of every member
          of GI JOE are recalling their
          operatives. We are now considered
          a rogue unit, uncontrollable. Shut
          down. We're to report to
          Washington for debriefing.
          Hawk rolls his wheelchair to the door.

          RIPCORD
          That's it? They've got Duke!

          

          

          

          

          86.
          Hawk stops his wheelchair, turns to them.

          HAWK
          I said you were to report to
          Washington. I didn't say when, or
          which route to take.

          SCARLETT
          Maybe a northern one.
          Hawk smiles and wheels out the door.

          EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DUSK

          A NIGHT RAVEN rockets through the orange skies, SMASHING
          through the sound barrier with an ear-tingling SONIC BOOM.

          INT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DUSK

          Storm Shadow sits in a meditative state. Duke is shackled,
          hands bound, out of his ACCELERATOR SUIT. Ana steps out of
          the cockpit area and approaches him, nods to Storm Shadow.

          ANA
          He thinks I should kill you.

          DUKE
          Why don't you?

          ANA
          James wants to meet you in person.

          DUKE
          James?

          ANA
          Mr McCullen.

          DUKE
          Ana listen--

          ANA
          --Talk softly, or he'll tazer you
          again.

          DUKE
          (raises his bound hands)
          Loosen these, he'll never taser
          anything again.
          She taps the bonds on his wrists.

          

          

          

          

          87.

          ANA
          I should've thought of this before.
          They almost share a smile.

          DUKE
          Let me get this straight. You're
          with McCullen. You're married to
          that Baron. And you claim you're
          still in love with me.

          ANA
          I'm a complex woman.

          DUKE
          Maybe you just don't know who you
          are anymore.

          ANA
          Who I was died long ago.

          DUKE
          No, this isn't you, I still see the
          person I loved behind your eyes.
          Her eyes soften for a moment.

          ANA
          Tell me what she was like.

          DUKE
          She was smart, and funny. She was
          loyal as hell. She loved those she
          was close with, me, her brother...
          (agonized pause)
          I did my best. With Rex. I'm
          sorry. He was my responsibility.
          I should have... It's why I left,
          Ana. Why I couldn't be with you.
          You were in so much pain... I
          thought the sight of me just give
          you more.
          She seems to be affected by this ever so slightly, then... a
          hard, cold look comes to her eyes, she shakes her head.

          ANA
          It doesn't matter now.

          DUKE
          No, it matters very much. We have
          the chance to make things right.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          ANA
          Nothing will ever be right again.
          Duke stares at her, his heart ripped apart. WE PUSH IN ON
          the two of them and FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - WASHINGTON D.C. - FLASHBACK - DAY

          Rain is drizzling on a military cemetery. Ana sits alone,
          without family, without Duke, staring straight ahead as Rex's
          casket is lowered into the ground.
          Parked on a nearby road is a lone car. Duke sits inside it,
          staring at the funeral in the distance. His face tells us
          the anguish he's living with. He pulls out and starts to
          drive away, the rain on the windshield BLURS AS WE DISSOLVE

          TO:

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - POLAR ICE CAP - NIGHT

          The Night Raven zeroes down on a stretch of ice near a huge
          CAVE. A SET OF RUNWAY LIGHTS appear under the ice, guiding
          it in for a smooth landing. The cave swallows the plane
          whole.

          INT. ICE CAVE - NIGHT

          The Night Raven rolls to a stop inside the cave. The side
          door opens. Storm Shadow exits with the weapons case. Ana
          leads Duke out, two Neo-Vipers behind them. Storm Shadow
          clicks a hand held remote and a HIDDEN ICE WALL opens to
          reveal a HI-TECH DIVING BELL awaiting them. Duke uses the
          moment to lunge forward, grab the case and haul ass towards
          the cave door. Storm Shadow spins, Shurikan throwing stars
          in his hands. The Neo-Vipers whip up their pulse rifles.

          ANA
          NO! McCullen has plans for him!
          Storm Shadow throws a star, it whistles across the cave and
          nails Duke in his shoulder, Duke goes down hard, staggers
          back up, but the Neo-Vipers are already on him, they start
          beating the living shit out of him. Ana jogs up.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Enough!
          Storm Shadow picks up the case and looks at Duke, face down,
          bloody and beaten.

          

          

          

          

          89.

          STORM SHADOW
          And what was your plan? Run three
          thousand miles across the ice?
          He rips his star out of Duke's shoulder. Duke sucks it up.

          STORM SHADOW (CONT'D)
          Stupid soldier.
          Duke rolls over and stares up at them, breathing hard.

          INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT

          Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, Heavy Duty and Breaker are in
          the conn tower of a next-gen submarine, going over a 3-D MAP
          of the polar ice cap.

          HEAVY DUTY
          That's a lotta ice.

          RIPCORD
          It's gonna be like trying to find
          whale spit in the ocean.
          Breaker sees a SMALL LIGHT flashing on his Ball-Eyepiece.

          BREAKER
          That's strange.

          SCARLETT
          What?

          BREAKER
          When they stole the weapons case, I
          set my suit to scan for the tracker
          beacon in case it came back on, and
          it just came back on.
          Ripcord just smiles.

          RIPCORD
          That's my boy.

          EXT. ARCTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

          The DIVING BELL comes shooting down out of a shaft in the
          bottom of the ice cap and rockets down towards the facility.

          

          

          

          

          90.

          INT. DIVING BELL - NIGHT

          As the diving bell descends, Duke stares at the facility out
          the portal. He is awed by the immense size of the place, he
          looks at Ana, proud of her office.

          ANA
          Certain work needs to be done away
          from the public eye.

          INT. ENTRY PORT - NIGHT

          The diving bell entry port opens, guarded by two Neo-Vipers.
          McCullen stands waiting. His eyes first move to the weapons
          case in Storm Shadow's hands. Storm Shadow opens it and
          shows him the three remaining warheads. McCullen runs his
          fingers over them, then nods, Storm Shadow closes the case.

          MCCULLEN
          Take them to the drones. I want
          them ready to launch in one hour.

          STORM SHADOW
          It will be done.
          And only then does McCullen greet Ana.

          MCCULLEN
          My beautiful Lady of the Lake...
          He kisses her. Ana kisses him back with slightly-feigned
          affection, her eyes open and on Duke. Duke stands there,
          impassive. McCullen finishes the kiss and turns to Duke.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          This bother you?
          Duke says nothing, so McCullen steps closer.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Isn't it funny, with the entire
          balance of power in the world about
          to shift, a couple of guys can
          still have a stare down over who
          gets the girl.
          Duke takes the opportunity to HEAD BUTT McCullen. The Neo-
          Vipers instantly pummel Duke to the floor. McCullen wipes a
          small trickle of blood from his nose.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          The interesting thing about my Neo-
          Vipers is they still think the same
          thoughts they always did, they just
          can't act on them anymore. Instead,
          they do what I want. I imagine that
          must be very frustrating.
          He gets right down in Duke's face.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          I'm going to make you very unhappy.

          DUKE
          (grit teeth)
          I'm already happy.
          McCullen glances at Ana, watching the display with conflicted
          eyes. McCullen heads for the door, beckoning the Neo-Vipers
          to make Duke follow him.

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          Duke trails behind McCullen and Ana, flanked by Neo-Vipers.

          DUKE
          What're you gonna do with the
          warheads?

          MCCULLEN
          You take to your training well,
          that's good. Still trying to
          develop information. Still planning
          to escape and stope me. Moments
          from now, you'll see that won't
          ever happen.

          DUKE
          Then you won't mind telling me.

          MCCULLEN
          Isn't it clear? I'm a business man.
          I'm going to use them.

          DUKE
          Millions of people are gonna die if
          you launch those warheads. What is
          it you want, McCullen?

          

          

          

          

          92.

          MCCULLEN
          Merely to strike fear into the
          hearts of every man, woman, and
          child on the planet. Only then will
          they look up to the man who wields
          the most power, and obey him.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The control room is alive with TECHNICIANS squirreling about
          various stations. Monitors show three large AERIAL DRONES
          sitting in vertical launch bays. Duke sees the drones and his
          face registers the horror of what McCullen's about to do. He
          glances at Ana, she quietly looks away, a hint of remorse in
          her eyes? The Doctor rises to greet McCullen, glancing at
          Duke for several moments, as if struck by the sight of him.

          MCCULLEN
          Meet the genius behind all my
          nanotechnology.

          THE DOCTOR
          My genius lies only in taking what
          others created to the logical next
          steps. All modern gains in science
          are made through theft.

          MCCULLEN
          You'll have to excuse his modesty,
          when I found him, he was --

          THE DOCTOR
          (interrupting, re: Duke)
          --Another "recruit"?

          MCCULLEN
          Albeit a rather unwilling one. The
          Doctor's nano-mites can control all
          manner of brain functions. When you
          wake up, you'll be working for me,
          and your past will be a distant
          shimmer that floats in and out of
          your mind like a leaf on a breeze.

          THE DOCTOR
          I'll prepare him for the surgery.
          The Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him
          towards another door. Duke and Ana exchange one last look.
          McCullen keeps his eyes on her as she watches him go.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          EXT. DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - UNDERWATER - DAY

          A school of fish swims past the facility, one fish breaks
          away from the school. CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT ON IT: it's not a
          fish at all, but a mini robotic underwater spy system.

          EXT. SUBMARINE - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          A sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters.

          BREAKER (V.0.)
          Picture's coming on line now.

          INT. CONN TOWER - SUBMARINE - DAY

          In the Conn Tower of the sub, our team gathers around Breaker
          who sits at a monitor watching what the "fish" is watching.

          SCARLETT
          It's an underwater facility...

          HEAVY DUTY
          McCullen's home away from home.

          RIPCORD
          Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere.

          SCARLETT
          Wait, what's that?
          Breaker ZOOMS IN on a massive TURBO-LASER CANNON.

          BREAKER
          Oh, Jesus...That's an automated,
          phased array turbo-pulse battery.
          (off their looks)
          A really big gun.

          SCARLETT
          Could it take out our sub?

          BREAKER
          That thing could take out a dozen
          subs simultaneously.

          SCARLETT
          Then that's our first objective.

          RIPCORD
          No, no. Duke's our first objective.

          

          

          

          

          94.

          SCARLETT
          The main force can't attack as long
          as that cannon's online.

          HEAVY DUTY
          How you figure getting it offline?
          Snake-Eyes points to the DIVING BELL CABLES n the monitor.

          SCARLETT
          Elevator cables. They've got a
          surface entrance. Shipwreck?
          She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR "SHIPWRECK"
          DELGADO, a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran.

          SHIPWRECK
          Going up, senorita?
          Scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor.

          SCARLETT
          Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I
          will infiltrate the factory from
          above and destroy the cannon. Heavy
          D, as soon as we give the word, you
          lead the assault from outside.

          HEAVY DUTY
          (nods grimly)
          Go, Joes...

          EXT. ICE FIELD - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          A quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice. All
          of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of
          all earthquakes. It cracks and ruptures and then erupts as
          the CONN TOWER of the submarine crashes through, then grinds
          to a halt. A FORWARD HATCH OPENS and two ROCK SLIDES launch
          out, landing hard on the ice and speeding away. Ripcord and
          Breaker on one. Scarlett and Snake-Eyes on the other.

          INT. LAUNCH BAY- DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch monitors showing
          TECHNICIANS securing the warheads onto three rocket propelled
          SMART-DRONES. As the last one is secured a Technician says:

          TECHNICIAN
          All drones prepared and ready, Sir.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          MCCULLEN
          Good, commence the launch sequence
          immediately.
          is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana's face?

          INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          Our team races into the ice cave on their ROCK SLIDES and
          park beside the dormant Night Raven. Weapons up. Scanning the
          place from top to bottom. Ripcord stars at the awesome plane
          towering before him.

          RIPCORD
          That McCullen's got some gadgets.
          Breaker gestures to the ice wall. Snake-Eyes uses his Katana
          sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out,
          revealing the DIVING BELL CABLES, but no diving bell.

          BREAKER
          Maybe we could slide down.
          Snake-Eyes shakes his head, doubtful

          SCARLETT
          The arctic water would kill us.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch the drones sitting in
          the launch bays on the screens. Technicians are working hard.

          TECHNICIAN
          Three... two... one... ignite primary
          engines.
          The entire control room begins to shake. The screens fill
          with fire.

          INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          The Joes run outside, wondering what the hell is causing the
          earthquake. A large circle of ice near them MELTS. And then
          the first drone EXPLODES UP before them and LAUNCHES into the
          morning sky, peeling away to the east. Before they can react,
          the second drone EXPLODES UP a hundred yards away, peeling
          off to the west. They hear the third one about to rocket up--

          

          

          

          

          96.
          Snake-Eyes thinks fast, sprints into the cave, jumps on a
          Rock Slide, hauls-ass outside, hits a WEAPONS SWITCH on his
          Rock Slide, prepping two HEAT-SEEKING ROCKETS on either side
          of the vehicle. The third drone LAUNCHES UP from two hundred
          yards away. Snake-Eyes locks onto its exhaust and FIRES. The
          missiles race up after the drone and knock it out of the sky.
          It EXPLODES. Metal FLIES. Snow BURNS.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The technicians see this on their monitors.

          TECHNICIAN
          We lost one.

          MCCULLEN
          Lost one? What do you mean?

          TECHNICIAN
          Bird Three is down, Sir.
          McCullen looks at the monitors, enraged. Storm Shadow smiles.

          STORM SHADOW
          We're under attack.

          MCCULLEN
          Alert all defences. Charge up the
          pulse cannon.
          He turns to say something to Ana, but she has left the room.

          EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          Topside, the team watches the two remaining drones race away.

          BREAKER
          What about the other two?

          RIPCORD
          We find the kill switches and short
          out the nano-mites.

          BREAKER
          (shakes his head)
          They're already way out of range.

          SCARLETT
          Then somebody has to go up there
          and shoot those things down.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          RIPCORD

          (PAUSE)
          That's me.

          INT. NIGHT RAVEN - ICE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Ripcord climbs into the Night Raven's cockpit. Scarlett steps
          up to watch. He's already flipping switches and putting on a

          FLIGHT HELMET.

          SCARLETT
          Can you even fly this thing?

          RIPCORD
          I can fly anything. You just track
          those warheads and guide me in. We
          don't have long until they hit.

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord?
          He glances at her, a moment between them. Then she presses
          forward and kisses him on the mouth. He stares back at her.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          Good luck.

          RIPCORD
          Do me a favor? Save Duke.
          She gives him a nod, then leaves. Ripcord grins to himself.

          EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - ICE CAVE - DAY

          The NIGHT RAVEN tears across the ice and launches into the
          sky. Ripcord WHOOPS with adrenaline. Scarlett, Snake-Eyes,
          and Breaker fast rope down into the first launch bay as the
          ice REFORMS behind them, hiding the hole.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          We now find Duke, wearing only SURGICAL TROUSERS, strapped on
          the operating gurney we saw Zartan on earlier. The SMART
          ROBOTS warming up around him as the Doctor approaches.

          THE DOCTOR
          The atomic bomb that was dropped on
          Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent
          of the city. Seventy percent... Did
          you know that, Duke?

          

          

          

          

          98.
          Duke looks at him, something familiar.

          REX
          There was a bank situated less than
          one hundred yards from Ground Zero,
          destroyed of course. Only one thing
          survived. It's four bank vaults.
          And when those vaults were opened,
          they discovered everything inside
          them had survived completely
          unscathed.

          DUKE
          Who are you?

          THE DOCTOR
          Of course, the vault I took shelter
          in wasn't that well-made.
          He unclips his BREATHING TUBES and lowers the mask to reveal
          a scarred and burned face.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Double Bubble?
          Duke is beyond shocked.

          DUKE
          Rex...
          Rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask
          over his face.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          You sonuvabitch... Ana buried you.

          THE DOCTOR
          A moving ceremony, I'm sure. The
          three volley salute. The flag on
          the coffin.

          DUKE
          Why? .Why didn't you come in...?

          THE DOCTOR
          Because I found out the truth...

          AND WE FLASHBACK TO: JUNGLE BUILDING - DAY
          Rex moves through the building with Fireteam Bravo.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          BRAVE SOLDIER
          Intel says the lab's in the
          basement.
          Fireteam Bravo kicks open a door. They lead the way down a
          staircase toward the basement. Rex follows, nervous as hell.
          The soldiers round a corner, suddenly, Rex hears GUNFIRE, he
          freezes, then silence, Rex pulls out his .45 And rounds the
          corner to see Fireteam Bravo down. A GUARD is trying to clear
          a jam in his machine gun. As he clears the weapon and raises
          it, Rex raises his .45 and fires first. The Guard drops.
          Rex checks Bravo, but they're not moving. He looks around the
          basement, no lab, but he sees a massive VAULT DOOR, closed.
          He heads for the vault, 45 raised, breathing hard. WHOOSH, a
           blast of refrigerated air hits him as he opens the door.
          Rex enters a small room filled with DEAD ANIMALS in huge
          FORMALDEHYDE JARS> Something inside the animals is constantly
          reshaping their appearances, reforming their facial bones and
          changing the color, texture and elasticity of their skins.
          There is a scuffling noise, Rex points his gun. A small,
          stooped old SCIENTIST in a lab coat appears.

          SCIENTIST
          Are you going to shoot me?...
          Rex doesn't respond.

          SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
          We knew you were coming. But I
          couldn't walk away from it...
          Rex stares in awe, not what he was expecting.

          REX
          Stay where you are.
          His gun up, he finds a COMPUTER TERMINAL and begins accessing
          various files, starts reading them.

          REX (CONT'D)
          These aren't chemical or nuclear--

          SCIENTIST
          No. Something much... better.

          RES
          This is beyond anything... This is
          light years ahead of anyone in the
          field.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          SCIENTIST
          You see why I couldn't leave.
          Rex nods, hypnotized by the science in front of him, an
          instant bond formed with the man who created it. The distant
          sound of Jets. The Scientist moves to the vault door and
          begins pulling it closed as we hear the J-Dam Bunker Buster
          whistling towards them.

          SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
          If we live, I'll show you
          everything...

          WE SMASH CUT BACK TO THE MEDICAL WING - PRESENT
          Duke tries to absorb what he's learned. The Doctor continues.

          THE DOCTOR
          The man who created this technology
          was not our enemy. In fact, he was
          hired by our very own government to
          create it. When it was deemed too
          unethical, they sent us to kill
          him. He didn't survive the blast.
          But I... lived.
          (touches his face)
          And I escaped with his research.
          Unfortunately I tested it on myself
          first, and lost my lungs and vocal
          chords in the process. But now I've
          perfected it, and you will get a
          first-hand experience.

          DUKE
          (his biggest concern)
          Does Ana know about this, about
          you?

          THE DOCTOR
          No... and she never will.
          He glances at the SMART ROBOTS and Duke realizes.

          DUKE
          You sick bastard... you did this to
          your own sister?

          THE DOCTOR

          (INCENSED)
          I loved my sister! Do you have any
          idea the state she was in? Me dead.
          You AWOL. Depression, drugs.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          101.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          So, I had her brought here, gave
          her a way to deal with her pain,
          gave her purpose. Made her strong.
          I gave her a new life, Duke.

          DUKE
          Why work for McCullen?

          THE DOCTOR
          He saved my life, for starters. Now
          to mention infinite resources to
          work in the field of my choosing.

          DUKE
          That's bullshit. You could have had
          any job you wanted.

          THE DOCTOR
          I didn't want any job. You can't
          play nice with science, Duke. It's
          sometimes necessary to experiment,
          to fail, even to destroy to attain
          a goal. It's a fact that McCullen
          has the guts to embrace.

          DUKE
          (still shocked)
          Everything she's done, everything
          she's become, started because she
          thought you died that day.

          THE DOCTOR
          And because you then abandoned her,
          let's not forget that part.
          And with that, he leaves Duke to the SMART ROBOTS, which
          menacingly begin to move in.

          INT. LAUNCH BAY - DAY

          Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Breaker drop down into the launch
          bay. They see a chrome corridor leading into the facility.

          SCARLETT
          It's pressure plated and laser
          protected. Anyway around it?

          BREAKER
          No. Any object larger than a
          quarter will fry your britches.
          Snake-Eyes shakes his head with a sigh, then steps forward
          and leaps onto the floor, landing on his fingertips.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          Then, with incredible strength, he proceeds to walk across
          the floor on his fingertips, aware of the continuous crackle
          and hum of lasers around him. Scarlett and Breaker watch with
          baited breath. Snake- Eyes now reaches the doorway.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          What you'll have to do is rewire
          the laser panel's brain by--
          --Snake-Eyes swiftly balances on one set of fingertips while
          his other fingers grab his sword and STAB the laser panel.
          The sound of the laser net instantly vanishes.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          .or you cold just stab it.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          Duke lies on the operating table as a SMART ROBOT makes an
          incision behind his right ear. Duke grimaces. A long needle
          zeroes in on the incision. As the needle dives towards Duke's
          head, a hand hits a switch and the needle quickly retracts.
          Duke looks over to see Ana by the controls, gazing at him.

          ANA
          I don't have much time.
          She rushes over and unties him and they stare at each other,
          then kiss passionately. All of a sudden, Duke feels something
          behind her right ear, he turns her head, --an INCISION SCAR.
          He looks at her, but before he can say anything, Ana's body
          snaps rigid and falls limp in his arms.

          DUKE
          Ana!
          Duke looks over to see the Doctor holding his PDA, McCullen
          and two Neo-Vipers beside him, their rifles on Duke and Ana.
          Duke gazes at Ana, desperately feeling for her pulse.

          INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Two TECHNICIANS man the firing controls of the huge TURBO
          LASER CANNON. Snake-Eyes takes them out and shuts down the
          cannon. HE sends a quick message on his WRIST-COMMUNICATOR.

          INT. CONN TOWER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees the message appear on a screen. "CANNON OFF-
          LINE. HAVE A NICE DAY." Heavy smiles and turns to Shipwreck.

          

          

          

          

          103.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Let's get in this fight.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          The GI JOE submarine peels around a rocky headland now, in
          full view of the underwater facility. A series of TORPEDOES
          fire out of the submarine's launch tubes. Most are blown up
          by the facility's Harpoon Cannon defenses, but several manage
          to hit the facility's exterior. KA-BOOM!!

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          The whole place SHUDDERS. Scarlett and Breaker blow the
          control room door and cut down the Technicians trying to
          shoot them. Breaker takes over a station console.

          BREAKER
          Okay, I've got a lock on the two
          remaining warheads. Target one is
          Moscow! Target Two is Washington!

          SCARLETT
          Give Ripcord the coordinates.

          INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Snake-Eyes spins to see a pair of KATANA BLADES come crashing
          down at him from behind.
          He spins, but one of the blades cuts him on his left arm,
          sending him reeling backwards, it's Storm Shadow. Who quickly
          powers the laser cannon back online. Snake-Eyes dives to stop
          him, --and as their swords meet WE FLASH CUT TO:
          THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two sixteen year-
          olds, Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow, trade blows with wooden
          katanas. Storm Shadow drops Snake-Eyes, who falls hard, Storm
          Shadow steps on his throat, sword point in Snake- Eyes' face.
          Hard Master looks on without expression. FLASH CUT BACK TO:
          THE CONTROL ROOM, where Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow's blades
          flash like lightning, they battle fiercely around the room. A
          Neo-Viper charges up the controls. Snake can't stop him.

          

          

          

          

          104.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Outside, the massive TURBO-LASER swings wildly towards the
          submarine and fires. A BRILLIANT BLUE PULSE ripples through
          the arctic sea, glancing the side of the vessel. WHAM!!

          INT. CONN TOWER - DAY

          The submarine shakes hard. Rivets burst. Water pours in.

          SHIPWRECK
          The hull's been ruptured!

          HEAVY DUTY
          Everyone into the attack boats!

          EXT. SUBMARINE - DAY

          Hatches open along the sides of the submarine, deploying ten
          SHARC ATTACK CRAFT carrying dozens of Joes. At the same time,
          batches begin to open on the facility and a dozen MANTIS
          attack craft carrying dozens of Neo-Vipers emerge.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty and Shipwreck pilot one of the SHARCS. The huge
          opposing force coming at them is quite terrifying.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Keep tight everybody.
          He fires a HARPOON TORPEDO which BLASTS a Mantis. The mantis
          craft RETURN FIRE. The whole area explodes in a pulse fire
          and harpoon blasts. The Joe submarine sinks and EXPLODES at
          the base of the facility.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          Duke cuddles dead Ana, clearly emotional. McCullen steps up.

          MCCULLEN
          Is she still alive?

          THE DOCTOR
          For now.

          MCCULLEN
          You said this couldn't happen.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          THE DOCTOR
          I didn't think it could. I've never
          seen anyone defeat the programming,
          even momentarily.
          Duke recovers and angrily grabs one of Ana's PISTOLS and
          kills the two Neo-Vipers, then turns the gun on the others.
          The Doctor lifts his PDA, finger on the "TERMINATE" BUTTON.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          If I press this, Ana dies.

          DUKE
          Put it down.

          THE DOCTOR
          Your choice, Duke.

          DUKE
          Put it down!
          The Doctor doesn't move. McCullen watches the stand-off his
          right hand discreetly drawing STEEL HOSE out from his sleeve.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord streaks into the upper atmosphere in the Night Raven,
          the curve of the Earth visible out his windows. Ahead, he can
          see a PULSATING LIGHT.

          RIPCORD
          I see it, dead ahead.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOL - DAY

          Breaker speaks into his headset.

          BREAKER
          You have to knock it down before it
          re-enters the atmosphere so the
          nano-mites don't reach the ground.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord flicks a switch and opens a PULSE LASER on the nose.

          RIPCORD
          Uh, I've got a problem. The fire
          controls are not in here.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          BREAKER'S VOICE
          What do you mean, not in there?

          RIPCORD
          I mean I can't see them anywhere!

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Scarlett hears this and realizes.

          SCARLETT
          It's gotta be voice-activated.

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          What?

          SCARLETT
          You have to say the words into your
          flight helmet.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord lines up the missile in his sights, gets a lock.

          RIPCORD
          Fire!
          (nothing happens)
          Shoot!
          (still nothing)
          Blast away!
          Still nothing, the missile streaking onwards towards the
          Earth.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They hear Ripcord yelling over the speakers.

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          Nothing's happening!

          BREAKER
          Must be a different language.

          SCARLETT
          (to Ripcord)
          Try "teine".

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          What?

          

          

          

          

          107.

          SCARLETT
          It's Scottish for fire.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord's not sure about this, the missile arcing down.

          RIPCORD
          Teine.

          SCARLETT
          Listen to my voice, "Teine".

          RIPCORD
          Teine! Teine! Teine!
          (nothing happens)
          It's not working!

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          That's because you're not saying it
          right!

          RIPCORD
          How many different ways you want me
          to say it?

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          One way! The right way! Teine!

          RIPCORD
          Teine!
          And at last the PULSE LASER fires. Blasting the missile out
          of the sky. The CLOUD OF NANO-MITES floats aimlessly away.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They all see the missile disappear on their screen.

          BREAKER
          Nice work, Ace. You just saved
          Moscow.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord sighs with relief, already peeling away.

          RIPCORD
          Just doing my job. Guide me to the
          other drone...

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          108.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          (under his breath)
          .man, I freakin' saved Moscow!

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - WASHINGTON - DAY

          The White House glistens in the midday sun.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY

          The American President's Bodyguards rush him and his staff
          down into a fortified bunker beneath the White House.

          PRESIDENT
          How soon will it strike the city?

          STAFFER
          Seventeen minutes, Sir.

          PRESIDENT
          This will be a disaster the likes
          of which we have never seen.
          As the DOORS CLOSE behind them we see the MARS INDUSTRIES
          LOGO on the doors.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Another blast from the TURBO-LASER destroys a SHARC.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees this as he takes out a MANTIS.

          SHIPWRECK
          That cannon's going to kill us all.

          HEAVY DUTY
          My guy will take care of it, trust
          me.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          Snake-Eyes kills the Neo-Viper, who falls down a large shaft
          into freezing waters. Storm Shadow lunges at Snake-Eyes and
          the two of them tumble down into the shaft, but land on a
          gangway. They both leap up and begin to fight again. The Neo-
          Viper tries to crawl out of the freezing water, seemingly
          unfazed as he slowly freezes solid.

          

          

          

          

          109.
          All of a sudden, there's LOUD NOISES and a series of ENERGY
          LASERS power on up and down the shaft between various circuit
          modules. This is where the energy is charged to operate the
          cannon. One of the lasers catches Storm Shadow's shoulder and
          burns him severely. Snake-Eyes sees this and ducks just as an
          ENERGY LASER fires on beside his head.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Outside, the TURBO-LASER fires. The Joe craft desperately
          weave and dodge.

          INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          .and the LASER NET fades. Instantly, Storm Shadow and Snake-
          Eyes continue their desperate fight. Swords FLASH and CLANG,
          two masters at their best. AND WE FLASH CUT TO:
          THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two twenty-two
          year olds, Storm Shadow and Snake-Eyes sword fight. Storm
          Shadow knocks Snake-Eyes to the ground again and places his
          steel sword against Snake-Eyes' face. Again, Hard Master
          watches without expression. AND WE FLASH CUT BACK TO:
          THE ENERGY SHAFT, where Storm Shadow slashes Snake-Eyes
          across the chest, but before he can finish him off, the
          cannon charges up again and the LASER NET slams on. Storm
          Shadow twists his body to avoid the ENERGY LASERS while Snake-
          Eyes lifts himself up to his toes to avoid a laser that
          threatens to disintegrate his crotch. Storm Shadow sees this,
          grins to himself.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY

          A staffer is on the phone, looking up at the President.

          STAFFER
          It seems somebody's shot down the
          warhead heading for Moscow.

          PRESIDENT
          Thank God...
          As he says this, a SECRET SERVICE AGENT draws a SILENCED
          PISTOL and kills the other Agents and Staff. We see an
          INCISION SCAR behind his right ear and realize he is a Neo-
          Viper. The President stares, stunned and horrified. The Neo-
          Viper holds his pistol on the President as--

          

          

          

          

          110.
          --A BOOKCASE moves on the wall, revealing a secret room. An
          UNSEEN FIGURE emerges and the President stares in shock.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Up in the skies, Ripcord spots the second drone rocketing
          down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him.

          RIPCORD
          Second drone in my sights.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Breaker and Scarlett watch in the control room.

          BREAKER
          Hurry, Rip. You've only got thirty
          seconds before it enters the lower
          atmosphere.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord's feeling the pressure. He targets the missile.

          RIPCORD
          Taine!
          But nothing happens. Scarlett's voice yells in his head.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Teine! Teine!

          RIPCORD
          Don't yell at me!

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Teine.
          Ripcord takes a breath, stealing his nerves. A RED FUEL LIGHT
          starts beeping on his control board. Rip does his best to
          ignore it, focusing on the missile as it begins to disappear
          into the lower atmosphere. The light beats faster and louder.

          RIPCORD
          Teine!
          The LASER PULSE fires, blasting straight at the missile which
          is lost in the atmospheric haze below. For a moment, he can't
          tell if he hit it or not.

          

          

          

          

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The tracking in the control room provides the answer.

          BREAKER
          You missed! The warhead has entered
          the lower atmosphere!

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord realizes this as he enters the lower atmosphere
          himself. The spread of WASHINGTON D.C. Far below him now.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          In the operating chamber, the stand-off reaches its boiling
          point now. McCullen slowly approaching Duke who keeps Ana's
          pistol on the Doctor, Ana still in Duke's arms.

          MCCULLEN
          Did you think she loved you?

          DUKE
          Stay back!

          MCCULLEN
          Did you imagine your life with her?

          DUKE
          I said stay back!

          THE DOCTOR
          Don't you know you've lost, Duke?

          DUKE
          All I know is that neither of you
          deserves her.
          McCullen suddenly lifts the STEEL HOSE in his right hand--
          --A BURST OF FLAME tears out at Duke who reflexively fires
          the PULSE PISTOL at it. The intense air blast from the pulse
          pistol catches the flames midway between them and blows them
          back onto McCullen. McCullen SCREAMS as his face is literally
          burned off. The Doctor freaks and drops the PDA, then yanks
          McCullen out into the corridor. Duke fires after them, then
          grabs the PDA, removing Ana's screen with a sigh of relief.

          

          

          

          

          112.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVE - SKIES - DAY

          Above Washington, Ripcord guns his aircraft after the falling
          drone. Getting real close this time. No way he can miss.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see this on the screens in the control room.

          BREAKER
          You're too close, Rip. Back up.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord gets eerily calm all of a sudden.

          RIPCORD
          Actually, I think I'm just about
          close enough...

          (PAUSE)
          .teine.
          The PULSE LASER fires point blank. The missile EXPLODES right
          in front of him. Ripcord flies through the flames, the CLOUD
          OF NANO-MITES latching onto his wings.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The drone disappears from their screens now.

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord? What happened? Rip!

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord is now struggling mightily with his controls as the
          NANO-MITES swiftly eat his plane.
          His FUEL LIGHT flashes at him alarmingly. He angles the Night
          Raven upwards, giving it all he's got, NANO-MITES everywhere.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see his plane angle back up into the upper atmosphere.

          

          

          

          

          113.

          BREAKER
          He's taking the nano-mites back up
          into the upper atmosphere.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          The Night Raven is breaking up all around Ripcord now. He
          quickly attaches his flight helmet's BREATHING MASK.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          Ripcord turns the plane over, inverting it.

          RIPCORD
          Cur magh!
          The canopy explodes. Rip shoots back down into the atmosphere
          as the NANO-MITES devour the Night Raven, then float away...

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see this on their screens.

          BREAKER
          He did it... He actually did it...

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord? Talk to me...Ripcord!
          Still nothing. And now they begin to suspect the worst. Then:

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          I asked you not to yell at me.
          Relief comes rushing back to Scarlett and Breaker.

          SCARLETT
          What happened? Are you okay?

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          Yeah, did it work?

          SCARLETT
          Yes...yes, it worked.

          EXT. PARACHUTE - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord smiles, parachuting down towards Washington.

          

          

          

          

          114.

          RIPCORD
          (into headset)
          Good...cause I think I'm about to
          get arrested.

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

          Ripcord lands on the White House lawn, holding his hands up
          benignly as dozens of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS surround him.

          INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          ENERGY LASERS pulse on again, almost catching the two ninjas
          in their fight. Snake-Eyes draws his KATANA SWORD, its blade
          shimmering in the laser-light as he redirects the laser back
          into its module. Storm Shadow does the same with his sword,
          barely saving his neck. They glare at each other.
          AND WE FLASH CUT TO THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where the two 26
          year-olds fight with katanas. Storm Shadow presses forward,
          Snake-eyes side-steps and hurls Storm Shadow to the ground!
          He steps up and puts his sword tip in Storm Shadow's eye.
          Snake-Eyes first ever win over Storm Shadow.
          Hard Master CLAPS ONE TIME. Storm Shadow looks at his father,
          he can't believe it, his father seems happy for Snake-Eyes.
          He slaps the sword away, gets up and stalks off.
          FLASH BACK TO: The cannon fires and the lasers disappear,
          freeing them to continue their duel. This is it. The final
          duel. Snake-Eyes struggles, exhausted and wounded. Storm
          Shadow puts in every ounce of hate he has left. He finally
          tears Snake-Eyes' sword away and kicks him down. About to go
          for the final kill. But before we find out the climax to
          their fight, we must finish their story:
          ON THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE GROUNDS, Snake-Eyes, still 26, walks
          along the pond. He hears a LOUD CRY. Snake-Eyes breaks into a
          run, careens around a building and sees Hard Master slumped
          on the ground, a sword in his back.

          SNAKE-EYES
          Master!
          Other NINJAS come flooding in.

          NINJA #1
          That's Storm Shadow's sword!

          NINJA #2
          There! There's the murderer!

          

          

          

          

          115.
          Snake-Eyes spins to see Storm Shadow climb up the side of the
          Temple, onto the rood, give him a last look, and jump down
          over the wall. FLASH BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT where Snake-
          Eyes is suddenly filled with renewed energy, he stares up at
          Storm Shadow's katana blade poised for the final kill.

          STORM SHADOW
          You took your vow of silence to
          avenge our Master. But now you will
          die without a word.
          The LOUD NOISE gears up again, distracting Storm Shadow for
          just a beat. Snake-Eyes uses the moment to catch Storm shadow
          with his feet, holding him up for a split second as the
          ENERGY LASERS come back on. One of them burns deeply across
          Storm Shadow's neck, he SCREAMS and stumbles back and falls
          OVER THE EDGE and down into the freezing turgid waters. Snake-
          Eyes steps up and looks down to see if he surfaces... He
          doesn't.

          SNAKE-EYES
          Father always feared it would come
          to this.
          EXPLOSIONS begin to rock the shaft now. Snake-Eyes stumbles
          towards the exit, leaving his fallen Sword Brother behind.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees the cannon return to its dormant position.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Turbo-laser is down!
          He guns his engines, firing at a MANTIS attack craft. It
          EXPLODES. Heavy Duty howls with delight.
          Around him, the Joes begin to turn the tide of the battle. A
          SERIES OF SHOTS of Mantis vehicles getting nailed by Joe
          harpoon cannons.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They feel the EXPLOSIONS in the control room. Screens short
          out. Water starts to cascade in through BURSTING RIVETS.

          BREAKER
          Energy overload in the phased array
          battery. Power subsystems are going
          critical.

          

          

          

          

          116.

          SCARLETT
          Let's get out of here!
          Scarlett grabs Breaker by the scruff of the neck and hauls
          him out of the room.

          INT. TRIDENT - DAY

          McCullen's face is horrifically burned as The Doctor helps
          him down into the Trident. EXPLOSIONS blowing above them. The
          pilots guide the sub out white the Doctor starts injecting
          McCullen with NANO-MITES. McCullen starts to SCREAM...

          INT. DIVING BELL ENTRY PORT - DAY

          Scarlett and Breaker races into the diving bell entry port
          and are shocked to find Snake-Eyes already here. Scarlett
          runs up and gently hugs him.

          SCARLETT
          Snake!
          Snake-Eyes grimaces, then looks Scarlett in the eyes.

          SNAKE-EYES
          .he's dead.
          She knows who he means, she gives him a grim smile. And
          that's when they see Duke, carrying Ana, charging up to them.
          Another EXPLOSION makes them all dash into the diving bell.
          The doors close and we hear them launch.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty notices the Trident escaping out of the EXPLODING
          docking bay into the arctic water. He angles towards the sub.

          HEAVY DUTY
          We got a runner! Cut him off!
          All of a sudden, the whole damn facility EXPLODES.
          INSIDE THE DIVING BELL: Our heroes are rocked by the BLAST,
          then they see MASSIVE CHUNKS OF POLAR ICE plummet down from
          the ice pack above, cutting off Heavy Duty and the Joes, and
          DEMOLISHING the remainder of the facility. The Trident
          disappears behind the trillions of bubbles and falling ice.

          

          

          

          

          117.

          INT/EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Shipwreck checks his targeting scanner.

          SHIPWRECK
          All other targets neutralized.

          HEAVY DUTY

          GO JOES!!

          EXT. TRIDENT - UNDERWATER - DAY

          The Trident is moving fast through the water somewhere.

          INT. TRIDENT - UNDERWATER - DAY

          McCullen turns to us and we see that the NANO-MITES have
          created a FORM-FITTING MASK all over his face. He catches his
          reflection in the portal and he grabs at the mask, the NANO-
          MITES twisting with the contours of his muscles to reveal his
          complete and ever-lasting horror. He breaks down, falling to
          the floor, then he recovers and looks up at The Doctor.

          MCCULLEN
          I guess I should thank you, Doctor.
          The Doctor is busy fiddling with his hand held PDA.

          THE DOCTOR
          I want you to call me... Commander.
          (looks at McCullen)
          And from now on, I'll be on a first
          name basis with you, Destro.
          McCullen's silver face goes blank.

          MCCULLEN
          Yes, Commander.

          INT. VIEWING ROOM - MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY

          Duke watches Ana through a two-way mirror. She sits alone in
          a holding cell. A MILITARY SCIENTIST watches her with Duke. -

          SCIENTIST
          Physically, she's fine. But without
          the correctly-coded kill frequency,
          we can't short them out.

          

          

          

          

          118.

          DUKE
          There's nothing you can do?

          SCIENTIST
          Only the man who put them in there
          has the correct code.
          Duke considers this carefully, staring at Ana.

          INT. CORRIDOR - MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY

          Duke walks along a prison corridor with Ana, led by two
          PRISON GUARDS. She carries a small bundle of PRISON GEAR.

          DUKE
          I'll visit you.

          ANA
          I won't be here long.

          DUKE
          You'll be here for the rest of your
          life, Ana.
          She looks at him, her face softening.

          ANA
          Duke?

          DUKE
          I'm here.

          ANA
          After all I've done, .you can't
          save me, .it's too late.
          A BEAT passes between them.

          DUKE
          I'll visit you.
          And for a moment, she appears to crack... but then a
          sinister smile creases her mouth.

          ANA
          You know, this has only just begun.
          She touches his face, then the PRISON BARS slam shut between
          them. She holds his eyes a moment longer, then the two Prison
          Guards lead her away. Duke just watches her go, his face torn
          with pain. He walks off alone...

          

          

          

          

          119.

          INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY

          General Hawk is in his wheelchair, still recovering from his
          wounds. He leads Duke and ripcord to the Howler.

          HAWK
          With GI JOE reinstated, would you
          boys like to stay on awhile?

          DUKE
          What do you say, Rip?
          Ripcord looks at Scarlett, who throws him a wink and a smile.

          RIPCORD
          I'm good.
          They all laugh. Rip steps up to her.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          So how do you feel about this?

          SCARLETT
          I feel very... emotional.
          Duke smiles and the Joes climb aboard as the platform rises.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL OFFICES - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

          A bevy of SECRETARIES and STAFFERS greets the President. Then
          he enters the Oval office and closes the door, alone, he
          looks around, walks behind the desk, and grins as he sits, as
          if this is the first time he's ever done this. With a little
          flair, he CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and we realize this is Zartan!
          And we SMASH CUT TO BLACK and ROLL CREDITS...




                                    THE END
the Ghost and the Darkness - by William Goldman

 



"THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS"

by

William Goldman



FADE IN ON

A TINY FIGURE OF A MAN hurrying toward camera. The figure gets 
larger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or 
where we are.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		This is the most famous true story
		of Africa. It happened a hundred
		years ago, but even now, when
		children ask about it, you do not
		tell them at night.
			(The FIGURE continues 
			to grow)
		It began with the race to build a
		railroad across Africa.
			(beat)
		But this is not about building a
		railroad- it is about Patterson.

And now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious, 
serious about his life, serious about his career. He has been 
successful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his 
talents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody.

AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND.

More specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant 
building - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat, 
everything is clean and in order.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		Patterson was thirty. A brilliant
		engineer. A fine man, but do not
		become attached to him- there are
		many fine men in this story but do
		not become attached to any of them.
			(beat)
		So many of them die.

Patterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks. Waits.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		And remember this: only the
		impossible parts of what follows
		really happened...
			(Now the door opens
			and we-)

CUT TO

Just a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway. This is 
ROBERT BEAUMONT - 40, with an irresistable smile. We're in his 
office and the place reflects the man - clean, cold. There are 
maps and charts on the walls. He ushers Patterson inside.

				BEAUMONT
			(The great smile flashes)
		John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm
		Robert Beaumont.
			(They shake hands)
		Firm- I like that, tells me a lot
		about you-
			(beat)
		-now why don't you tell me about me?
		To get you started, many people find
		me handsome, with a wonderful smile.
		I'm sure you agree.
			(Surprised, uncomfortable,
			Patterson nods)
		Winning personality, heaps of charm?

				PATTERSON
		My wife is the game player in the
		family, sir.

				BEAUMONT
		Games?
			(staring dead at Patterson)
		Look at me closely, Patterson: I am
		a monster. My only pleasure is
		tormenting people who work for me,
		such as yourself.
			(again the smile - only
			now it's chilling)
		One mistake and I promise you this:
		I'll make you hate me.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he realizes Beaumont is serious. Beaumont turns 
sharply and moves to a large map.

CUT TO

THE MAP. It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear 
line that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles.

				BEAUMONT
			(pointing along the line)
		We are building this railroad
		across Africa for the glorious
		purpose of saving Africa from the
		Africans. And, of course, to end
		slavery. The Germans and French
		are our competition. We are ahead,
		and we will stay ahead providing
		you do what I hired you to do-

CUT TO

A MORE DETAILED MAP. This one ends at "Tsavo," 130 miles in.

				BEAUMONT
		-build the bridge over the Tsavo
		river. And be finished in four
		months time. Can you do that?

				PATTERSON
		I'm sure you've examined my record.
		So you know I've never yet been
		late on a bridge.

				BEAUMONT
		You've never built in Africa.

				PATTERSON
		But I have in India- every country
		presents problems.

				BEAUMONT
		You'll need your confidence, I
		promise you.

				PATTERSON
		I've got a reason far beyond
		confidence: my wife is having our
		firstborn in five months and I
		promised I'd be with her when the
		baby comes.

				BEAUMONT
		Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched
		you confided in me.
			(beat)
		But I don't really give a shit about
		your upcoming litter. I've made you
		with this assignment-
			(the smile)
		-don't make me break you.

				PATTERSON
			(smiling right back)
		You won't have the chance.
			(glancing at his watch)
		Any further words of encouragement?
			(silence)
		Then I've a train to catch.

They look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear 
they do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we

CUT TO

A RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER

A train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise. 
Patterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around.

CUT TO

HELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the 
kind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not 
begun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into 
his arms.

				HELENA
		I tried to be late, John- it would
		have been easier if you'd gone.

				PATTERSON
			(They are nutty about
			each other - he nods)
		We're not much good at goodbyes, 
		Helena.

				HELENA
			(brightly)
		Tell me about Beaumont- does he
		understand how brilliant you are,
		how lucky he is to have you?

				PATTERSON
		It was embarrassing- the man showered
		me with compliments.

They start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a 
quieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious-

				HELENA
		Oh dear-
			(beat)
		-you're geting that downtrodden look
		again-

				PATTERSON
		-well, it's just...
			(beat)
		...other men don't abandon their wives
		at such a time-

				HELENA
			(not unkindly)
		-oh please- if I'd been against your
		taking this, you would have abandoned
		me. You've been desperate to see Africa
		your whole life.

				PATTERSON
		What if there are complications?-

				HELENA
		-not "what if"- there will be, there
		always are. Which only means that our
		"son" and I- note my confidence- will
		have an excuse to come visit.

THE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds.

				HELENA
		Go, now.
			(He kisses her hand)
		Such a gentleman.
			(Now he holds her)

				PATTERSON
		I am desperate to see Africa- but I
		hate the leaving.

CUT TO

HELENA. She hates it, too.

				HELENA
		You build bridges, John-
			(beat)
		-you've got to go where the rivers are.

They hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into 
each other's arms a final time, then-

CUT TO

THE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam-

-Patterson runs into the clouds and disappears.

HOLD FOR A MOMENT.

KEEP HOLDING.

Patterson runs out of the steam and we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A DIFFERENT TRAIN, A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, A DIFFERENT WORLD.

This is the train to TSAVO and Patterson is alone on the engine 
seat- a wooden bench in front of the engine used by railroad 
inspectors and visiting VIPs. Behind it is a white circular piece 
of wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers.

CUT TO

NIGEL STARLING, running as best as he can alongside the train, 
trying to pull himself up onto the engine seat.

STARLING is a terribly appealing young man. Clothes do not fit him 
well, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that 
shirttail, trying to get things right. He wears glasses, tends 
nonetheless to squint at the world. He is, above all, a good man, 
morally impeccable and very much a product of these Victorian 
times.

				STARLING
			(as Patterson helps
			him aboard)
		Many thanks.
			(squints)
		You're Patterson, yes?
			(Patterson nods)
		Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you
		at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must
		have told you that.

				PATTERSON
		He just gave me his "monster" speech.

				STARLING
		That. I know Robert seems dreadful, 
		but when you truly get to know the man,
		well, he's much worse.
			(beat)
		And I'm one of his defenders.
			(Patterson smiles)
		Forget him for now- it's your first
		ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it
		breathtaking.
			(And on that word-)

CUT TO

STARLING coughing like crazy, hands over his face which is caked 
with dust- he and Patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary 
desert.

				PATTERSON
			(shouting toward Starling)
		"Breathtaking" doesn't begin to do it
		justice.
			(As Starling starts to
			laugh, his mouth opens
			and sand flies in, and
			his coughing fit returns
			and)

CUT TO

THE DESERT. ENDLESS. LATER IN THE DAY.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM, bent over, arms covering their faces as the dust 
gets worse- a wind has kicked up.

CUT TO

THE TRAIN, TRYING TO MAKE IT UP A STEEP GRADE. STILL LATER.

Patterson and Starling are walking beside the train now, helping 
to push it, trudging through the dust. All the other passengers 
spread out behind them, also pushing- the train obviously needs 
all the assistance it can get.

CUT TO

INSIDE A RAILROAD CAR, EARLY EVENING.

Patterson and Starling, filthy, sit together. Starling has nodded 
off. Patterson has a book open in his lap-

-we can tell there are drawings of African animals- not all that 
accurate.

Now Patterson's eyes close and he sleeps.

CUT TO

THE TRAIN POUNDING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

Stokers shovel coal. They are exhausted but they keep at it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. WAKING IN THE CAR, RUBBING HIS EYES. IT'S DAWN.

He stares out-

-and from his face it's clear something special has happened. And 
now, at last-

CUT TO

SOMETHING SPECIAL- and what it is, of course, is Patterson's first 
view of the Africa of his imagination.

Because the desert has ended, and now there are grasses and trees 
and one more thing-

-bursts of animals. On both sides of the train.

A flock of birds materializes here, a cluster of gazelles doing 
there amazing leap there.

Patterson is like a kid in a candy store.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, back outside in the engine seat again. 
Starling points-

				STARLING
		Aren't they amazing?

CUT TO

WHAT HE'S POINTING AT: Some giraffes running along, their absurd 
shape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly 
long strides.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, staring out.

				PATTERSON
		You know the most amazing thing
		about them?- they only sleep five
		minutes a day.
			(Starling glances at him-
			clearly, he didn't know that)

CUT TO

A FAMILY OF HYENAS. Close by, loping in their scary way.

				STARLING
		Don't much like them.

				PATTERSON
			(nods)
		The females are bigger- only animal
		here like that- have to be or they
		wouldn't survive because the males
		eat the young.

CUT TO

STARLING studying Patterson. Clearly, he didn't know that, either.

CUT TO

SOME HIPPOS moving along. Starling turns to Patterson.

				STARLING
		Anything special about them?

				PATTERSON
		Just that they fart through their
		mouths.
			(beat)
		Must make kissing something of a
		gamble.

				STARLING
			(laughs)
		I've lived in Africa a year and I
		don't know what you know. How long
		have you been here?

				PATTERSON
			(looks at his watch)
		Almost three hours.
			(beat)
		But I've been getting ready all my
		life.
			(Now, from them-)

CUT TO

A BUNCH OF IMPOVERISHED-LOOKING NATIVE WOMEN. They hold children 
who wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished 
looking than their mothers.

				STARLING
			(suddenly touched)
		Every time I see something like that,
		I know we're right to be here- to
		bring Christianity into their lives,
		enrich their souls.

				PATTERSON
		Beaumont says it's to end slavery.

				STARLING
			(shrugs)
		We all have our reasons. Mine is 
		simply to make them understand 
		happiness, accept salvation, know the 
		serenity that comes-
			(interrupts himself)
		-best I stop. One of the by-products 
		of my belief is that I can become 
		amazingly boring. But I know God smiles 
		on me.

				PATTERSON
			(They really like each other)
		Have you got that in writing?
			(Starling, amazingly good
			natured, laughs. And now-)

CUT TO

A WHITE CLAW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Hundreds of white claws.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

They aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and 
they're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree.

And there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in 
with other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked 
red rocks-

-now the train begins to slow.

Smoke drifts across.

A bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks.

				STARLING (over)
		Welcome to Tsavo.
			(on the word)

CUT TO

TSAVO.

We have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a 
place that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water 
tower is under construction-

-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for 
work.

THE TRAIN goes slower still.

No one stands idly around here.

But no one looks happy either.

ONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL.

An ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light 
the world.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train.

				STARLING
			(indicating Samuel,
			who is approaching)
		Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely
		indispensable- the only man here
		everyone trusts.

				PATTERSON
			(softly)
		Does he speak English?

				SAMUEL
			(not softly enough)
		And very poor French.

				STARLING
			(introducing)
		Samuel- John Patterson.

				SAMUEL
			(as they shake)
		The bridgebuilder-
			(gesturing to the 
			working men)
		-we have been getting ready for 
		you.

				PATTERSON
		Excellent. Could I see the bridge
		site?
			(Samuel nods)

				STARLING
		I've got medical supplies to
		deliver. Come along to the hospital
		when you're done.
			(starting off)

				SAMUEL
		I will bring him, Nigel.

We should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at 
the very beginning of the picture.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower.

Standing on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely 
powerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH.

WORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead, 
some SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling.

				PATTERSON
		Why do the workers look unhappy?

				SAMUEL
		Because they are here.
			(beat)
		Because Tsavo is the worst place in
		the world.
			(He points ahead)
		Come, John- to the bridge.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along.

CUT TO

THE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it.

And here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot 
where the movie takes place was like.

There were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived 
in a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have 
come from the same town back in their country might choose to live 
in one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another 
cluster.

What we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are 
dozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, 
these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.)

The places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's 
living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where 
the bridge is to be built, etc., etc.

As they move, Samuel points out various camps.

A SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer.

ANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating.

A GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area.

Anyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a 
wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more.

Okay, back to the story.

				PATTERSON
			(as they pass the INDIAN
			tent area where prayer is
			starting)
		It's all wonderfully under control,
		Samuel- you've done a splendid job.

				SAMUEL
		Thank you. The truth is this: you
		have to work at it constantly.

				PATTERSON
		The workers don't get on?

				SAMUEL
		Get on? They detest each other.
		Obviously the Africans hate the
		Indians. But the Indians also hate
		the other Indians. Some of them
		worship cows, while others eat them.
			(As they move on)

CUT TO

RAILROAD TRACK.

PAN ALONG TO

MORE RAILROAD TRACK.

KEEP PANNING

And suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL standing high above the Tsavo River. The 
track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where 
it just stops-

-and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words, 
is the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of 
track.

				SAMUEL
			(to the far side)
		Railhead is across there.

CUT TO

THE DISTANCE. Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great 
clouds of dust.

				SAMUEL
		Three thousand men laying track- when
		the bridge is done, it all joins up.

Patterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at 
the space where the bridge is to be.

				SAMUEL
		Did it look like this in your mind?

				PATTERSON
			(shakes his head)
		This is more difficult-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Excited.

				PATTERSON
			(eyes bright)
		-but how wonderful that it's 
		difficult, it should be difficult- 
		what better job in all the world
		than build a bridge?- make things
		connect- bring worlds together- and
		get it right!
			(Now from Patterson-)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL TENT

as Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around-

-it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured 
or with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, 
everything is working well, everything is under control. Starling 
approaches.

				STARLING
		Finish your tour?

				PATTERSON
			(nods)
		And anxious to get started.
			(indicating the hospital)
		What is this, mostly malaria?

				STARLING
		Yes- but their suffering is only
		transitory- once they except God
		into their hearts, He will vanquish
		all pain.

				MAN'S VOICE (over)
		That's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the
		poor bastards will relapse if you keep
		on that way.
			(As they turn-)

CUT TO

DOCTOR DAVID HAWTHORNE. A tough, middle-aged cockney. And a heavy 
drinker. A man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years.

				HAWTHORNE
			(to Patterson)
		I'm David Hawthorne, this is my
		hospital. And my advice to you is,
		"don't get sick in front of it."
			(beat)
		That was meant to be charming, 
		sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.

				STARLING
		You never had it.

				HAWTHORNE
		Nigel and I don't like each other much.

				SAMUEL
			(breaking the tension)
		I am also liaison between these two.

				PATTERSON
			(to Hawthorne)
		Clearly you don't agree about building
		the railroad?

				HAWTHORNE
		This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it?
		It's only being built to control the
		ivory trade, make men richer.

				PATTERSON
		Then why do you stay?

				HAWTHORNE
		Who else would hire me?
			(to Starling)
		Beat you to it, didn't I?
			(beat)
		Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a
		little welcoming gift.
			(Now he gestures and we-)

CUT TO

A NERVOUS ORDERLY who approaches them. He has been freshly 
bandaged across one shoulder.

				HAWTHORNE
		This is Karim, one of my orderlies-
		attacked by a man-eater earlier
		today- first incident of that kind
		here.

Patterson says not a word, just studies the wounded man.

				STARLING
			(incredulous)
		A man-eater attacks and you're such
		a buffoon you almost forget to mention
		it?

				HAWTHORNE
		Well, he got away, didn't he?
			(to Patterson)
		Riding a donkey not far from here 
		when the lion sprang on them- donkey 
		took the brunt of it- then suddenly 
		the lion ran off.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Listening. No emotion on his face.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. He's kind of enjoying this. Bearing down.

				HAWTHORNE
		I know it's your first day and of
		course you must be tired from the
		journey-
			(beat)
		-but what are you going to do about
		it?

				PATTERSON
			(a long pause, then evenly-)
		Karim will have to show me where it
		happened. And of course, I'll need
		the donkey.
			(beat)
		With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
			(And he walks out, leaving
			an astonished Starling
			staring after him)

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA

Starling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne. And 
there are half a dozen ORDERLIES.

Right now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent. 
Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches.

				STARLING
		I couldn't believe it when you said
		"sort it out." As if it were the most
		normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum,
		what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a
		killer beast this evening, nothing
		much else going on anyway."

				PATTERSON
		Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he?
		But that's all right- after all, I'm
		responsible for everything that happens
		here. And it certainly won't do much
		for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.

He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. 
There is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY 
COUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with 
precision. He arranges his books precisely too.

Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order.

				STARLING
			(calling out)
		You said "of course" you'd need the
		donkey. Why "of course"?

				PATTERSON
			(taking a rifle,
			moving outside)
		We know three things about man-eaters.
		First, they always return to where
		they've attacked before. Second, they're
		always old- they can't catch other 
		animals so they turn to us. And third,
		they're always alone- they've been cast
		out by their pride because they can't
		keep up.

CUT TO

STARLING, sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited. 
But also a bit reluctant.

				STARLING
		I don't suppose I could watch.

				PATTERSON
			(delighted)
		Might be exciting for you.

				STARLING
		I've never been all that adventurous.
		I wouldn't be in the way?

				PATTERSON
		I'd love the company. And I've hunted
		all my life.

				STARLING
			(gathering courage)
		Well, why not? You seem so calm and
		experienced.
			(standing, teacup in hand)
		Why not, indeed!
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

A SLIGHTLY WOUNDED DONKEY

It's roped loosely to a tree, bells around its neck. When it 
moves, they make a sound. Middle of the night. A night wind.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

We're in a clearing with thick trees all around.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND STARLING, seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge 
of the clearing, twelve feet up in the air. Patterson has his 
rifle ready. This next is all whispered.

				STARLING
			(embarrassed)
		I hate to be a bother, John, but the
		cramp's getting worse.
			(Pulls up his trousers-
			his leg is knotted)
		The pain is actually quite unbearable
		now.

				PATTERSON
		Shhh.

				STARLING
		I'm sure you mean that to be comforting,
		but-

				PATTERSON
			(interrupting)
		-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.

				STARLING
		That is precisely my plan- but back in
		my tent.
			(And he begins to climb down)

CUT TO

PATTERSON, grabbing him.

				PATTERSON
		They own the night- nobody moves when
		there's a man-eater out there.

Starling glumly obeys. Then-

				STARLING
		John? I know this isn't the time to ask,
		but-

				PATTERSON
		What?

				STARLING
		Since you'd only been here three hours
		when we met, are you sure this is how
		you hunt lions?

				PATTERSON
		Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse
		than you think- I've never even seen one.

CUT TO

STARLING, not pleased with this news. He massages his calf, tries 
to get comfortable, which is impossible. Patterson just stares at 
the night.

CUT TO

JUST BEFORE DAWN

The donkey dozes. So does Starling. Patterson has not so much as 
moved.

Now the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little.

And the donkey is suddenly awake and scared-

-and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears 
from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound 
EXPLODES-

-and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked 
but unhurt-

-he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it.

				STARLING
			(amazed)
		...one shot...

				PATTERSON
			(even more amazed)
		So that's what a lion looks like.
			(Now from the tree-)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL TENT AREA - JUST AFTER DAWN

HOLD for a moment.

				SAMUEL (over)
		One shot- one-

KEEP HOLDING

Now Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited-

-it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile.

				SAMUEL
		Patterson has made the nights safe
		again.

KEEP HOLDING FOR JUST A MOMENT MORE.

As he walks on, behind him come THREE COOLIES carrying the body of 
the lion. As dozens of men come running in from all over to see 
the dead man-eater-

				SAMUEL
			(mimes shooting)
		BOOM!
			(Now as the crowd
			continues to grow-)

CUT TO

A ROUGH ENGINEER'S DRAWING OF WHAT WILL BE THE BRIDGE

It has two embankments on either side of the river.

These embankments are big- forty feet wide, fifty feet high.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING standing on the high ground where the 
embankment will start. From here, there is a slope down to the 
river itself.

Also present is UNGAN SIGNH, who we saw earlier standing 
precariously atop the water tower. Singh, enormously powerful, is 
another assistant. Bright, a great worker, another main character 
in what is to follow.

Now Patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river- 
it's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother 
him. He talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who 
move down with him.

Singh, for all his massive size, moves like a cat. Starling does 
not, slipping and sliding.

				PATTERSON
			(gesturing)
		All right, I'd like to start the
		embankments today-
			(to Singh)
		-sufficient supplies on hand?

				SINGH
			(nods)
		More than.

				STARLING
		With much more on the way-
			(loses balance, falls)
		-John- we could have had this chat on
		flatter ground-

				PATTERSON
		-true enough- but without the comedy
		relief.
			(Starling, amazingly good
			natured, smiles, gets
			back up)

CUT TO

THE RIVER as they scramble down to it.

CUT TO

THE SLOPE they've come down- it's a long way back to the top.

CUT TO

THE THREE MEN. It's a glorious morning.

				PATTERSON
		How lucky we are.

				STARLING
		Aren't we full of ourselves today?
			(beat)
		I think it's because of the lion.

				PATTERSON
		Possibly.

				SINGH
			(soft)
		You know, I too have killed a lion.

				STARLING
		How many shots did you need?

CUT TO

SINGH. Almost embarrassed.

				SINGH
		I used my hands.

He holds his big hands up, palms out. Starling looks at Singh to 
see if he means it-

-he means it all right. Now, from Starling's perpetually surprised 
face-

CUT TO

SURVEYING EQUIPMENT

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON sighting through it- we are on the far side of the river 
now. Singh is there, Starling, too.

Behind them: a field of tall grass.

				PATTERSON
		All right- thee second embankment
		will go there.
			(He gestures toward
			the river)

				STARLING
		You do plan to mark it a bit more
		precisely than just-
			(imitating Patterson)
		-"there."

				PATTERSON
			(smiling)
		In your honor, Nigel. And you and
		Singh will be in charge of building
		them- and you'll also build the
		roadbeds and the three foundation
		pillars- and you'll be finished in
		eight thrilling weeks.

				STARLING
			(very dubious)
		John, it will not be easy.

				PATTERSON
		Nigel, you'll just have to use your
		hands-
			(And he smiles, repeating
			Singh's gesture, both 
			palms out)

CUT TO

SINGH. He smiles back, starts to reply. But his words stop, his 
smile dies. He just stares and we-

CUT TO

WHAT HE'S STARING AT- the surrounding field of tall grass. Nothing 
unusual about it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He stares, too.

CUT TO

THE FIELD OF TALL GRASS- suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a 
fresh wind.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Silent. As before. Starling follows his glance.

CUT TO

SINGH. Frozen.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. And now the field is making odd patterns- as if 
something unseen were moving through.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Quiet. Just the wind.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. Nothing visible. But the odd pattern seems to be making 
its way across the field.

CUT TO

SINGH AND STARLING. Quiet. Just the wind.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. The odd pattern seems to stop. Around it, the wind 
makes different shapes of the grass.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at 
the spot where the pattern stopped.

CUT TO

SINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to 
shiver, as if from cold.

CUT TO

THE BUILDING SEQUENCE

And what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity.

Huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and 
driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments.

And Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as 
the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in 
the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there.

And alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with 
glasses and very bright eyes.

Meanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that 
is on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to 
help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the 
clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with 
it, does well.

And Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but 
mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the 
placements of the three stone foundation pillars-

-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- 
and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the 
start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor-

-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes-

-which is all he wears from now on.

And the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, 
working with the power of three-

-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and 
Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded-

-it's hard, brutal work-

-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge 
skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work 
on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three 
foundation pillars are taking shape-

CUT TO

TONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to 
complete the embankments. As this goes on-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is 
going very quickly.

Patterson stops working, looks across the river-

-movement in the grassy area on the far side.

CUT TO

SEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to 
Samuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little 
men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL watching them.

				PATTERSON
		What are they looking at?

				SAMUEL
		You- they cannot believe you're
		still here.

				PATTERSON
		Nonsense.

				SAMUEL
		You don't know what Tsavo means, do
		you?
			(Patterson doesn't)
		It means "slaughter"...

CUT TO

THE NANDI TRIBESMEN, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads.

CUT TO

THE TWO EMBANKMENTS, as more and more red rock is shoved and 
pushed into shape.

CUT TO

THE THREE FOUNDATION PILLARS- almost finished.

CUT TO

THE ROADBED. The same.

CUT TO

THE NEAR EMBANKMENT as still more rock is forced in and

CUT TO

THE FAR EMBANKMENT done at last-

CUT TO

-and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the 
river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other.

And they all look at each other- the embankments are both 
finished- THE THREE OF THEM are flying-

-and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, 
in Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password.

HOLD. A big moment for them all!

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT AREA

He sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate 
is beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat.

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA

Starling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too.

CUT TO

SINGH, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep.

CUT TO

STARLING is in his tent, turning out his lamp, half asleep 
already.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in his tent, closing his eyes.

CUT TO

SINGH, deep asleep in his tent-

-he shares it with a dozen others and they're all deep asleep. 
They lie on the floor of the tent, heads together toward the 
center pole, feet toward the edges of the tent.

HOLD ON SINGH. It's very dark. HE AND HIS MEN just lie motionless, 
breathing deeply.

KEEP HOLDING.

Now the CAMERA moves up, high into the center of the tent, looking 
down at the circle of men.

KEEP HOLDING.

They don't move, not even an inch. The steady breathing is the 
only sound.

YES, KEEP HOLDING.

KEEP HOLDING.

Nothing is going on down there. Nothing at all.

KEEP HOLDING.

Not a goddamn thing.

KEEP ON HOLDING. KEEP ON HOLDING.

And now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide-

-and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by 
some giant invisible wire-

CUT TO

SINGH. CLOSE UP. Screaming.

CUT TO

THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT, waking, staring around and

CUT TO

SINGH as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams 
grow even louder as we

CUT TO

THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT and it's like a bomb just went off, they 
rise, spin, cry out, stare-

CUT TO

THE NIGHT OUTSIDE AND SINGH'S BODY sliding along the ground. It's 
pitch black, and he's going head first now, face upwards and he's 
going ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is that's 
making this happen is something we can't make out- because it's so 
dark and because it's on the far side of the man, and his body is 
in our way and

CUT TO

UP AHEAD, some bushes and

CUT TO

SINGH, his body going faster than before and his cries are 
weakening-

-CUT TO

THE NIGHT and his body and there is no sound at all coming from 
him now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making 
this happen- all we see, barely, is the limp body of the big man 
as it skims along and-

CUT TO

UP AHEAD NOW, a low clump of bushes.

CUT TO

SINGH'S BODY, coming closer and

CUT TO

THE BUSHES and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn 
bushes and now-

CUT TO

SINGH, suddenly rising magically in the night, his body flying 
over the bushes and gone!

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, early morning, their rifles held in front 
of them, racing along, suddenly stopping, staring down and

CUT TO

THE GROUND. At first we can't make out much. Then we can- a spot 
of red.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, hurrying on again.

CUT TO

THORN TREES, and as they force their way through them-

CUT TO

A LARGE VULTURE, wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth-

-HOLD-

-as it lands we can see A DOZEN OTHER VULTURES are already there, 
surrounding something-

-but we can't make it out. We are in an area of grass and shadow-

-and specks of blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, cries out in shock and fury, fires his rifle, races 
forward.

CUT TO

THE VULTURES screeching and screaming, taking off, and as we watch 
them soar into the morning sky-

				HAWTHORNE'S VOICE (over)
		What the lion must have done, once 
		he'd killed Singh, was lick his skin 
		off so he could drink his blood-

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

Hawthorne is examining Singh's body, trying to be professional, 
but he's clearly upset- it's awful.

				HAWTHORNE
		-then he feasted on him, starting
		with his feet-

				STARLING
			(evenb more upset)
		-please- you needn't be so graphic-

				HAWTHORNE
		You intend "sorting this out" tonight?

				PATTERSON
		I'll try- but this feels so different-
		that old lion I killed could never
		carry off a man Singh's size.

				STARLING
			(maybe a little alarmed)
		But you said they were always old.

				PATTERSON
		That's what the books say...
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

FLAMES RISING IN THE DARKENING SKY. NOW-

CUT TO

ABDULLAH in tears. Where are we?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

This is Singh's funeral pyre.

Singh's body is being burned.

A LOT OF INDIANS are there. We've caught sight of some of them 
before- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him 
in his tent.

There is a terrible sense of shock.

Patterson stands at the rear. He is terribly moved. Now, unseen by 
the others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final 
time.

CUT TO

THE FLAMES; they continue to rise...

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT

Night. The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut 
and tied.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, the middle of the night. He is alone, fifteen feet up 
in a tree near Singh's tent. He holds his rifle, ready for 
anything. He cannot get comfortable.

CUT TO

THE AREA- nothing, no movement.

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT. As before.

CUT TO

THE AREA. No sign of movement of any kind. Dead.

CUT TO

THE MOON. Lower in the sky. The night is growing to a lose but 
there is still darkness.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his 
eyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do-

CUT TO

TWO HUGE YELLOW EYES. That's all we see, just the eyes and they 
are near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down 
and-

CUT TO

THE HUGE YELLOW EYES- only they're gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky.

CUT TO

THE SUN, RISING, THE NIGHT DONE.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back 
toward his tent area. Now he stops.

CUT TO

ABDULLAH and a large group of workers- only they're not working. 
They smoke, play cards, sit around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, steaming, going up to Abdullah.

				PATTERSON
		You were contracted to work-

				ABDULLAH
			(gesturing around)
		-malaria epidemic; very sudden.

				PATTERSON
		Let me see the sick.

				ABDULLAH
			(not backing off)
		Oh, you're a doctor now, too?

				PATTERSON
		There is no reason for fear.

				ABDULLAH
		On that I choose to remain dubious.
			(beat)
		Two are dead now in two nights.
			(And on that news-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Rocked. He didn't know. Behind him now, Starling 
hurries up, Samuel alongside.

				PATTERSON
			(to Starling)
		Second death? Where?-

				STARLING
			(gesturing)
		-far end of camp- man wandering alone
		at night. Hawthorne's examining the
		body now.
			(beat)
		There's even less of him than of Singh.

				PATTERSON
			(just shakes his head)
		But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be
		that hungry this soon.
			(getting control- he
			looks to Samuel)
		Samuel?

				SAMUEL
		We should construct thorn fences 
		around every tent area. Fires burning 
		at night.

				PATTERSON
		Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew-
		no one allowed out at night.
			(to Abdullah)
		Send half your men to the bridge, the
		rest with these two.
			(Abdullah nods)
		And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But 
		I repeat- there is no reason for fear. 
		I will kill the lion and I will build 
		the bridge.

				ABDULLAH
		Of course you will, you are white, you
		can do anything...
			(They look at each 
			other. They are not 
			friends. Now-)

CUT TO

THE THORN BUSHES WE SAW ON OUR ARRIVAL TO TSAVO

ENDLESS NUMBERS OF THEM. There is a machete-like sound as we

CUT TO

A BUNCH OF WORKMEN, led by Samuel, chopping down branches. They do 
it with care- these are claws-

CUT TO

-STARLING, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, 
he's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his 
machete, moving in between bushes and

CUT TO

ONE OF THE BUSHES, SNAPPING BACK into Starling, and Starling 
taking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing-

-his arms are starting to bleed-

-he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at 
them, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and 
right now, he is possessed.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward 
the bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY AREA

For a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we 
saw with Singh. Something is making the grass move-

-only now there is no wind... HOLD.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Did he see it? We'll never know.

CUT TO

STARLING, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His 
clothes are shredded. A WORKER has finished with a section and 
satisfied, moves on-

-but Starling is far from finished. He grabs the thorns with his 
bare hands and squeezes them together.

				STARLING
		Not good enough- look, it's got to
		be tighter. Tighter.

CUT TO

THE AREA IN WHICH HE'S BEEN WORKING. FENCES ARE WELL ALONG TOWARD 
COMPLETION. IT'S LATE AFTERNOON.

PULL UP

We see more fences around more camp areas.

KEEP PULLING UP

The entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual 
areas protected.

The skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast.

Fires start up. Dozens of them.

Still darker.

Now workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety 
before darkness takes over. They zig-zag this way, that way, 
dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, 
get up, run on-

CUT TO

THE SUN. Falling out of the sky.

CUT TO

THE CAMP. The fires rise higher. No one moves... HOLD.

CUT TO

STARLING in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. 
Samuel is with him. Both are exhausted.

Patterson brings them each drinks. They nod thanks, drain them. 
They stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire. You 
get the sense these three will be friends forever.

				STARLING
		What a good week.

				PATTERSON
		You mean nobody died?

				STARLING
			(shakes his head)
		We all worked together. Worthy deeds
		were accomplished. I liked the labor.
			(beat)
		My mother insisted on piano lessons-
		broke the dear woman's heart when I
		turned out to be tone deaf- but she
		still was always at me about being
		careful with my hands.
			(looks at them)
		I like the blood, is that strange?

				SAMUEL
		Oh yes, I think so.
			(Starling smiles, starts
			to speak)

				PATTERSON
		Look out, Samuel, here it comes.

				STARLING
		Even you two must admit that it is a
		glorious thing, what Man can
		accomplish. When there is a common
		splendid goal, there are no limits.
		Think what we will accomplish when we
		all have God's warmth in our hearts.
			(Samuel's eyes have 
			closed; he begins to snore. 
			Patterson can't help
			laughing)

CUT TO

STARLING. As good natured as ever.

				STARLING
		I am immune to your disdain.
			(He looks at them now)
		When I came here, I had but one small
		goal: to convert the entire continent
		of Africa.
			(shakes his head)
		Now I've decided to move on to
		something really difficult: I will not
		rest until both of you are safely in
		the fold.

				SAMUEL
		I've had four wives, good luck.

				STARLING
		The struggle is the glory...
			(HOLD ON the three friends)

CUT TO

PATTERSON, the next morning, working with Abdullah and some others 
at the bridge.

CUT TO

STARLING completing work on the fence from the day before. It's 
high and taut and he's done a terrific job.

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION

A BUNCH OF OTHER MEN are working near a large grassy field. One of 
the men starts a chant. The others pick it up. It's really pretty.

CUT TO

PATTERSON wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the 
chant comes distantly to him on the wind.

CUT TO

THE WORKMEN CHANTING LOUDER. It's turning into a stunner of a day- 
glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds.

CUT TO

STARLING. Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men.

CUT TO

THE MEN WORKING AND SINGING. As before.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY FIELD. As before-

-except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something 
flicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone 
too quickly.

CUT TO

THE MEN WORKING, SINGING ON.

CUT TO

PATTERSON waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the 
men, of the birds. The sun is higher in the sky.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY FIELD-

-and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking 
back in another 180 degree arc-

-still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a 
tail. Now quickly-

CUT TO

PATTERSON wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view. He 
holds an envelope.

				SAMUEL
		For you.

				PATTERSON
			(taking it)
		Thank you, Samuel.

				SAMUEL
			(watching as Patterson
			opens it)
		Good news?

				PATTERSON
			(glancing at the letter)
		I expect so- it's from my wife.

				SAMUEL
		Do you love her?

				PATTERSON
		I do, actually; very much.

				SAMUEL
			(his wonderful smile)
		You give me hope, John.
			(As he walks away-)

CUT TO

STARLING, probing at the thorn fence, searching out any last 
weaknesses.

Behind him now, in the tall grass, something moves.

Starling, intent on his work, notices nothing.

CUT TO

THE SINGING MEN, getting more and more into it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, by the river, reading the letter.

There is a large tree up the riverbank. It casts a large shadow.

In the shadow now, something moves.

Patterson, intent on his reading, notices nothing.

				HELENA (over)
		Darling one- the big excitement
		yesterday was when some school-
		children spotted a whale-
			(pause)
		-they were looking at me, John-

CUT TO

HELENA, in their bedroom, moving across to the window, staring 
out. She now has a considerable stomach.

				HELENA
		That was an attempt at humor but I
		don't feel very funny these days. I
		miss you terribly and after our son-
		I still have total confidence- well,
		after he's born I think travel might
		be broadening. As he kicks me at
		night I'm quite sure he's telling me
		he definitely wants to come to Africa.
			(pause)
		Thought you might need reminding.

CUT TO

PATTERSON by the river. He smiles, folds the letter. Now-

CUT TO

THE SINGING WORKMEN at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they 
sound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound 
even better-

-there must be twenty of them, working and singing-

-and screaming!

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning his head sharply and

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same and

CUT TO

THE SCREAMING WORKMEN and they're running now, running and 
shrieking and that's all we see, the workmen-

-some of them run left-

-some run right-

-and now a few of them are starting to cry.

CUT TO

A FAT COOLIE running and running, glancing back, screaming louder, 
running on and on and

CUT TO

-a shadow in the grass- no telling what- but it's big and it's 
moving and

CUT TO

THE FAT COOLIE and this next goes so fast it could be a dream- or, 
more accurately, a nightmare-

SHOCK CUT TO

A GIGANTIC WHITE MANED LION as it leaps onto the Fat Coolie, 
brings him to earth, bites his neck in two, kills him, just-like-
that.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, as they race away from the river and

CUT TO

STARLING, running from the fenced area- he holds a rifle in his 
hands.

CUT TO

ANOTER PART OF THE CAMP AND A DIFFERENT BUNCH OF WORKMEN- they 
freeze as the screams reach them and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, on the way to his tent area and

CUT TO

DIFFERENT WORKMEN listening in fear and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, racing to his tent, grabbing his rifle and cartridges 
and

CUT TO

STARLING, running toward the screaming and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he charges ahead, loading his rifle on the fly and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, carrying more ammunition, running behind Patterson, 
keeping up and

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION and nothing is visible now- the men are gone and 
from this angle, it looks deserted and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, catching Starling, leading him into the TSAVO STATION 
area, Samuel just behind them.

CUT TO

A RECTANGULAR SHED, ahead of them. They move to it, slow-

-then they stop-

-a sound is heard- from around the corner- the sound continues- 
Patterson glances at Starling- the sound could be this: the 
crunching of bones.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, checking his rifle.

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same. Samuel, holding the extra ammunition, 
moves close to Patterson. Now-

CUT TO

PATTERSON as he suddenly steps away from the shed, rounding the 
corner and as he does-

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, with the Fat Coolie- the lion is crunching at his 
feet-

-then the lion stares toward the shed as we

CUT TO

PATTERSON, moving out into clearer view, Starling and Samuel right 
with him. THE LION is a good distance away.

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, a low growl coming from him as he takes the 
coolie's body by the shoulder, begins backing away with it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, dropping to his knees for the shot and

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same and

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, growling louder and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, taking aim and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow 
motion-

-Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and-

-and this thing is suddenly there-

-this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the 
flat roof of the shed and

CUT TO

THE SUN, blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully 
stretched, it seems to go on forever and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning around to see and

CUT TO

STARLING, turning too, and we're coming back into regular motion 
now as we

CUT TO

This enormous BLACK-MANED LION diving into the three, sending them 
all sprawling and

CUT TO

THE WHITE MANED LION roaring and

CUT TO

THE BLACK MANED LION roaring, running to the other and

CUT TO

THE TWO LIONS IN CLOSE UP.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, for that is how they will be referred 
to-

-and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth-

-The Darkness has eyes that are crazed-

-they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old 
and the young and the fat and the strong-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to 
reach for his rifle and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, the white and the black, as they move 
toward the field of tall grass, roaring and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S RIFLE and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring 
sounds are deafening now and

CUT TO

THE TWO GIGANTIC MALES, backing into the tall grass-

-they roar one final time-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we

CUT TO

THE TALL GRASS and they're gone, the grass is full of moving 
patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing 
this way, that way-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, staggering to his feet, staring at the grassy field.

				PATTERSON
			(dazed)
		Jesus, two of them...

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and

CUT TO

STARLING, LYING DEAD, his throat ripped open. HOLD briefly on the 
young man, then-

CUT TO

THE STATION AREA

A train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly 
chaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of 
the busier parts in camp-

-but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with 
several dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting 
for the train.

Patterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah 
and Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them 
walking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same.

				PATTERSON
			(shouting over the noise
			of the approaching train)
		-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-
			(gesturing toward the men
			who stand by the train
			tracks)
		-there's nothing wrong with your men
		so stop telling me there is-

				ABDULLAH
			(advancing on Patterson now)
		-you do not call me a liar- you know
		nothing of their health- consider
		yourself fortunate I persuaded so 
		many to stay- consider yourself 
		fortunate I have decided to stay-

				PATTERSON
			(losing it)
		You think you matter?
			(gesturing toward the
			train which is close to
			stopping now)
		-Beaumont is on that train- he 
		matters-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, moving in on Abdullah now-

				PATTERSON
		He sees this chaos, he'll replace 
		you all.

				ABDULLAH
		He'll replace you, too- that's all 
		you really care about.

				PATTERSON
		You think so? Fine.
			(finished arguing)
		It's best you get out. Go. Tell all 
		your people to go, run home where 
		they'll be safe under the covers and 
		when the bridge is built and the
		railroad is done, they can tell their
		women that out of all the thousands
		who worked here, they were the only
		ones to flee-
			(And he wheels around,
			starts to walk away as we-)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH. Quiet, staring after Patterson.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Patterson has won. As the two of them exchange a quick 
glance-

CUT TO

BEAUMONT standing in the door of a passenger car, handsome as 
ever. Somehow his clothes are still pressed.

Patterson moves up. In a splendid mood. Samuel is happy too.

				PATTERSON
		Pleasant journey?

				BEAUMONT
			(stepping off the train)
		How could it be? I hate Africa.

Now there is the sudden sound of men singing- Patterson looks 
around and we

CUT TO

ABDULLAH and his workmen, moving away from the train- they are 
singing the same song that the workmen sang just before The Ghost 
and The Darkness attacked- it's pretty- but it's also a little 
unnerving.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Listening a moment.

				BEAUMONT
		Lovely sound- they seem happy.

				PATTERSON
		Don't they, though?

				BEAUMONT
		So work must be going well?

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He and Samuel share another glance.

				PATTERSON
			(delicately)
		Truthfully?
			(beat)
		There has been the occasional odd
		hiccup- but then, as you so wisely
		told me, I'd never built in Africa.

				BEAUMONT
		But overall, you're pleased?

				SAMUEL
			(moving in)
		I have never experienced anything
		like it.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT; almost longingly looks back at the train.

				BEAUMONT
		I almost feel like getting right
		back on.
			(glances at his watch)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. They do not breathe.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. He really wants to leave and for a moment it looks like 
he just might.

				BEAUMONT
			(a sigh)
		I suppose it would be a dereliction
		of duty not to at least look around.

Now Abdullah wanders happily by.

				PATTERSON
			(waving)
		Morning, friend, glorious day.

				ABDULLAH
		As are they all.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. He takes a step inside the passenger car.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. Hoping.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Reluctantly returning. He has a large box.

				BEAUMONT
		I do need to see Starling.

				PATTERSON
			(dully)
		Starling?

				BEAUMONT
		Awhile back he ordered some bibles-
			(indicating the box)
		-I've brought them.
			(looking around)
		Is he here?

				PATTERSON
			(beat)
		Yes he is.

				BEAUMONT
		Well, I need to speak to him.

				SAMUEL
			(helpfully)
		Let me deliver the bibles.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. His eyes flick from one man to the other. It's over.

				BEAUMONT
		Excellent show.
			(voice low)
		Where is Starling?

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The jig is up. He gestures-

				PATTERSON
		Here he comes now.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

HALF A DOZEN NATIVES CARRYING STARLING'S COFFIN. They start to put 
it on the train and as they do-

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Stunned. And furious! He storms off the train and we-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE

as Beaumont sees it. Patterson and Samuel are with him.

Little more work has been done than the last time we saw it. A few 
men are working slowly.

And now there are guards with rifles patrolling it.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. A deadly look at them. He storms off.

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

as Beaumont sees it- Patterson, Samuel, and Hawthorne stand 
quietly.

It's much more crowded than the last time. Still under control, 
but barely.

Beaumont is icy now. He gestures sharply toward Hawthrone to join 
them.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL

THE FOUR MEN speak low and fast-

				BEAUMONT
		What in hell is going on?

				SAMUEL
		The Ghost and The Darkness have come.

				BEAUMONT
			(snapping)
		In English.

				PATTERSON
		It's what the natives are calling 
		the lions-
			(beat)
		-two lions have been causing trouble-

				BEAUMONT
		-what's the surprise in that, this is
		Africa?

				PATTERSON
		It hasn't been that simple so far.

				BEAUMONT
		What have they done besides kill
		Starling?
			(beat)
		How many have they killed?
			(Patterson nods for
			Hawthorne to answer)

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. Doing his best.

				HAWTHORNE
		Well, of course, I can't supply a
		totally accurate answer because
		there are those that are actually
		authenticated and there are those
		that we once thought were workers
		killing each other or deserting
		from camp so any number I give is
		subject to error-

				BEAUMONT
			(cutting through)
		How many?

				HAWTHORNE
		Thirty, I should think.

				BEAUMONT
			(stunned)
		Christ!
			(whirling on Patterson)
		What are you doing about it?
			(Now from there-)

CUT TO

SOMETHING VERY ODD:

We are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area. This is 
not near the track but off by itself, in an area surrounded by 
thorn trees.

Several workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it, trying to 
disguise the fact that the small railroad car is, indeed, nothing 
but a small railroad car.

It is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND BEAUMONT looking at it.

				BEAUMONT
		This is supposed to be salvation?
			(staring at Patterson)
		What kind of idiocy are we dealing
		with here?

				PATTERSON
			(keeping control)
		I'm calling it my "contraption"-
		we're going to surround it with a
		boma- a fence, to you- and we're
		going to leave a small opening
		opposite that door.

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD CAR. There is, in fact, an open front door. Patterson 
gestures for Beaumont to follow him inside.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE CAR AS THEY ENTER. It has been divided in half by thick 
metal bars from floor to ceiling. The bars are close together, 
only a few inches between them.

				PATTERSON
		In that half will be bait- human
		bait- I'll start things off-
			(points to the open
			doorway)
		-a sliding door will fit above that
		and a trip wire will run across
		the floor.

				BEAUMONT
			(The smile is back)
		Genius- the beast will enter,
		tripping the wire, the door will
		slide down, trapping him, you, safe
		behind the bars, will have him at
		your mercy and will shoot him.

Patterson nods. Beaumont explodes.

				BEAUMONT
		Are you running a high fever, man?
		How could you expect something as
		lunatic as this to succeed? How
		could you even conceive of it?

				PATTERSON
		I didn't conceive of it for the
		lions- I built one in India when
		there was trouble with a tiger.

				BEAUMONT
			(incredulous)
		And it worked?

				PATTERSON
			(He hates to say this)
		In point of fact, it didn't.
			(hurrying on)
		But I'm convinced the theory is
		sound.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM. They move outside. The tension between them is 
considerable. Beaumont looks at Patterson for too long a moment.

				PATTERSON
		What?

				BEAUMONT
		I made a mistake hiring you- 
		you're simply not up to the job.
			(Silence. Then-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP.

				PATTERSON
		You genuinely enjoy trying to	
		terrify people, don't you? Well, 
		fine-
			(lashing back)
		-except there isn't a higher rated
		engineer and we both know that. And
		since time is so important to you,
		how long do you think it would take 
		to find someone else qualified and 
		bring him here?

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Blazing.

				BEAUMONT
		Let me explain about time- you've 
		been here three months and already 
		two months behind. And the Germans 
		and the French are gearing up. And 
		I don't care about you and I don't 
		care about the thirty dead- I care 
		about my knighthood and if this 
		railroad finishes on schedule, I'll 
		get my knighthood and I want it.
			(glancing around as
			Samuel appears, goes to
			the workers)
		Professional hunters may be the answer.

				PATTERSON
		All they'll bring is more chaos and
		we've plenty of that already- and if
		they come in, word will get out- and
		what happens to your knighthood then?

				BEAUMONT
		I'm going to try and locate Redbeard-
		I assume you've heard of him.

				PATTERSON
		Every man who's ever fired a rifle has 
		heard of him- by the time you find him,
		the lions will be dead.

				BEAUMONT
			(long pause)
		Very well, the job's still yours, I'll 
		go. But if I have to return, you're
		finished. And I will then do everything
		I can to destroy your reputation. Am I
		not fair?
			(The great smile flashes)
		Told you you'd hate me.
			(And he turns, walks off)

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Moving up to Patterson. Samuel has a bag.

				PATTERSON
			(staring after Beaumont)
		I do hate him.
			(takes the bag from
			Samuel, pulls out flares)
		I want you to distribute one bag of
		flares to every tent area-
			(takes out a flare)
		-tell the men to light them if
		there's trouble-
			(beat)
		-make it two bags.
			(HOLD briefly, then-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. ALONE. THAT NIGHT. IN HIS CONTRAPTION.

A lamp burns alongside him. Across the bars, the door of the 
railroad car is open. Flickering shadows. Above the doorway is a 
thick wooden slab the size of the door. n the ground, barely 
visible, the trip wire.

CUT TO

THE DOORWAY. Outside, something is moving.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, rifle ready, holding his breath.

CUT TO

THE DOORWAY. SIlence. Nothing moves now.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He rubs his eyes with his hands...

CUT TO

FLICKERING SHADOWS on the wall. It's later that night.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The man is bleary with fatigue. He sits in a corner of 
the car, writing a letter.

				PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)
		"Dearest...
		...peace and tranquility continue to
		abound here- the workers report each
		day with a smile- except for your
		absence, this whole adventunre is
		providing me nothing but pleasure..."

CUT TO

THE FLICKERING WALLS OF THE RAILWAY CAR. It's later still. 
Patterson, finished writing, stares out at the night.

CUT TO

A FLARE, rising brightly toward the sky.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, seeing the flare. The man is miserable.

CUT TO

A TREE BRANCH. MANY FLOWERS AS WELL AS THE CLAW THORNS.

				PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)
		Fire.

The branch is destroyed, the flowers blown away.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THREE INDIAN COOLIES. NOT FAR FROM HIS CONTRAPTION.

THE COOLIES hold rifles. They look like brothers, which they are. 
They also look tough. And they are that, too. THREE 
STREETFIGHTERS.

				PATTERSON
			(impressed)
		Very good indeed.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
			(he wears glasses)
		We have hunted since childhood.

				PATTERSON
		All right- you'll spend your nights
		inside.
			(He indicates the railroad
			car. The Coolies nod)
		You'll have plenty of ammunition.
		You're totally protected, you have
		really nothing to fear.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		That is correct.
			(beat)
		Nothing.

Patterson looks at the three men. Obviously, he could not have 
chosen better. From them-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. DAY.

A lot of men working under Patterson. Progress is slow.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. NIGHT.

Some men sit on the part that's been built. Spending the night 
there for protection. Now, they all turn and we

CUT TO

ANOTHER FLARE going off in another part of camp.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, in a tree alone, in despair.

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES IN THE RAILROAD CAR.

Tough as ever. Ready for anything. But nothing is happening. 
Silence.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE AGAIN AS NIGHT FALLS - MORE CROWDED THAN BEFORE.

STILL MORE MEN are moving into the river. They wade til the water 
is up to their necks. Then they reach out, hold hands, start to 
sing.

CUT TO

PATTERSON moving high into a tree. He listens to the sound. 
Lovely.

CUT TO

MOONLIGHT ON THE WATER. The men stand as before, singing softly. 
The river here is calm, no current to speak of. The men are safe-

-or rather they should be.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling 
the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as 
the others start to scream-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, watching another flare rise, helplessly listening.

CUT TO

A CATTLE PEN. THE CATTLE ARE NERVOUS-

-one of them kicks wildly at the wind.

They should be nervous-

-The Ghost walks among them, chooses which one to kill, leaps on 
it, brings it to earth as the dust rises.

CUT TO

ANOTHER FLARE IN THE NIGHT.

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL. DAY. PACKED.

HAWTHORNE seems overwhelmed.

CUT TO

SOMETHING.

And for a moment we don't know what it is. There is a faint light 
and now we see what it is we're looking at: a wire.

HOLD ON THE WIRE.

And now a paw walks across it-

-and the instant that happens-

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES, the brothers, in the contraption, two of them 
asleep, a flickering lamp the only illumination in the railroad 
car and

CUT TO

THE DOOR OF THE RAILROAD CAR slamming loudly down and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE DARKNESS, standing alone in one half of the railroad car- it's 
incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked 
and

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

The entire of the car- the thick bars separating the two halves. 
In one half, the huge lion. In the other, the three armed, tough 
coolies.

For a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too 
startled and surprised to do anything but stare-

-and then all hell just explodes as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the 
kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but 
this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more 
terrifying and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, throwing his huge body at the bars and

CUT TO

THE BARS and both his front claws are slashing through and

CUT TO

THE THREE TOUGH COOLIES and they retreat against the rear wall of 
the car.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, rage building, throwing its body at the bars again 
and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do 
anything but stare and

CUT TO

THE CLAWS, ripping at the air and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping forward, smashing into the bars and

CUT TO

THE CEILING WHERE THE BARS are connected and the sheer power of 
his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, staring up at the ceiling and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, AND HERE HE COMES AGAIN, roaring and his body hits 
the bars and

CUT TO

THE CEILING- and the bars shake-

-but they're not giving way.

CUT TO

THE TOUGH COOLIES, as they begin to realize this and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, clawing for them and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, raging and roaring on his side of the bars and

CUT TO

THE FIRST COOLIE, raising his gun and

CUT TO

THE SECOND COOLIE, his gun raised too and

CUT TO

THE THIRD COOLIE and he's ready and

CUT TO

ALL THREE AS THEY FIRE-

-and reload-

-and fire again, and reload, and-

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD CAR- and suddenly the lamp is knocked over-

-and a fire starts, flames grow and it's starting to look like 
hell in there-

-only it gets worse as we-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS at the bars-

-and suddenly it stands up- it seems to fill the car, towering 
over everything, it's like a nightmare come to kill you-

CUT TO

THE COOLIES staring up at this giant thing, and of course they're 
more terrified now than they've ever been in their lives- but 
these are tough men and they ignore the flames, ignore the 
deafening roars of the beast and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, standing there, going crazy on his side of the bars, 
trying to knock them down but they're holding and

CUT TO

THE TOUGH COOLIES, reloading and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, racing around the enclosed area now and he's trapped 
and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes 
have never been so bright, his roars as deafening and

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES, firing again and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping at the bars again, and they shake, sure they 
shake, but they keep on holding and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, firing, reloading, firing, reloading and as they do, 
something's starting to come clear-

-amazing as it may seem, impossible as it may be to conceive, 
they're missing.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, whirling on his side, roaring and leaping and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES and sure they fire, but they're still so goddam scared 
and

CUT TO

THE DOOR THAT SLID DOWN- it's held in place by some thick wooden 
bars-

-and now the Coolies start to hit something- the wooden bars 
because they begin to splinter and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, whirling, leaping at the bars and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES firing and then-

CUT TO

THE DOOR as it flops open and just like that-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS. Out the door and gone. HOLD.

CUT TO

PATTERSON JUST AFTER DAWN IN THE DAMAGED RAILROAD CAR.

Patterson stands where The Darkness was. The three Coolies are 
where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars.

This was the lowest point yet for Patterson. Not only had his 
notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend 
how the coolies missed. It never seemed possible- but of course, 
it really happened.

				PATTERSON
		Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		-I would never make excuses- but a
		fire broke out- the light was bad- he
		kept moving-

				PATTERSON
		-well, of course he kept moving- but
		he couldn't have been more than ten
		feet away from the three of you- surely
		you must have wounded the thing-

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		I assure you we came close many times-

Abdullah is in the doorway near Patterson now- with several dozen 
men. And from Abdullah's face, this is clearly going to be a 
confrontation.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		-the next time we will do better.
			(Patterson makes no
			reaction; moves outside)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH, simmering, moving straight to Patterson as soon as he's 
out.

				ABDULLAH
		The next time will be as this time-
		The Devil has come to Tsavo-

				PATTERSON
			(not in a mood for this)
		-that's ridiculous talk and you can't
		seriously believe it-

				ABDULLAH
			(moving in- tension rising
			as others crowd behind him)
		-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I
		don't think so-

CUT TO

THE BUSH just beyond- something is moving- an animal?- Impossible 
to say.

				PATTERSON
		I wasn't and you know it and don't
		push it- just listen- we have a
		problem in Tsavo-

				ABDULLAH
			(cutting in)
		-at last you're right- we do- you are
		the problem in Tsavo-

				PATTERSON
		-careful, Abdullah-

Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous.

				ABDULLAH
		You do not tell me "careful"- you do
		not tell me anything- you listen
		while I talk-
			(Now suddenly a shadow
			seems to cross-)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH. CLOSE UP. His eyes widen.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

AN ENORMOUS PISTOL. Pressed hard against Abdullah's temple.

				MAN'S VOICE (over)
		-change in plan- you listen while
		I talk- because you have a question
		that needs answering.
			(beat)
		Will I pull the trigger?

PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL

REDBEARD.

We are looking at one of those legends- ageless and powerful, with 
a tanned face and a thick grey beard. He has seen everything and 
is capable of anything.

Just now he seems more than capable of killing Abdullah. Very 
calmly, he cocks the pistol.

				SAMUEL (over)
		It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill
		you.

				REDBEARD
			(not looking around)
		No hints, Samuel.

				ABDULLAH
			(The name has registered)
		You don't know all that has happened
		here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.

				REDBEARD
		You're right. The Devil has come. Look
		at me. I am the Devil.

CUT TO

ABDULLAH, staring at Redbeard. Right now Redbeard just could be.

				ABDULLAH
			(louder)
		I am a man of peace.

				REDBEARD
		Am I to take it you want to live?

				ABDULLAH
		Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

				REDBEARD
		Excellent decision.
			(Now he suddenly reaches
			out, shakes Abdullah's hand)
		Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll
		meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid
		morning.

				ABDULLAH
			(dazed- leaving)
		I think it's been a pleasure.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, and now he does another surprising thing: embraces 
Samuel.

				REDBEARD
			(three words)
		You got old.
			(Now he releases Samuel,
			turns to Patterson)
		I'm sure you're John Patterson.
			(before Patterson can reply)
		Stay out of my way.
			(And without another word,
			he's gone)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

as Redbeard moves through, taking it all in. It's even worse than 
when we last saw it- bodies crammed everywhere and always the 
sound of pain and sickness.

Patterson stands in the doorway, watching, waiting.

				PATTERSON
			(as Redbeard approaches)
		I didn't have a chance to thank you.

				REDBEARD
			(preoccupied)
		What did I do?

				PATTERSON
		Got me out of trouble.

				REDBEARD
			(matter of fact)
		Nonsense- Samuel would have done
		something.
			(starts to move on)

				PATTERSON
		We need to talk.

				REDBEARD
		Let me save time- (1) you are the
		engineer; (2) you are in charge;
		(3) you're sorry I'm here. Right
		so far?
			(Patterson nods)
		Good- because (1) I am not an
		engineer, (2) I don't want to be
		in charge, and (3) I'm sorrier than
		you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo.
		So I will help you by killing the
		lions and leaving, and you will help
		me by doing what I tell you so I
		can leave. See any problems?

				PATTERSON
		Actually, no.

				REDBEARD
		All right- let's go into battle.
			(suddenly taking
			Patterson's hand)
		I'm Redbeard.
			(as they shake)

				PATTERSON
		Somehow I guessed.
			(As they move outside-)

CUT TO

THE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

A BUNCH OF MEN WAIT. Hwathorne, Samuel, Abdullah, and perhaps a 
dozen other worker leaders. Redbeard and Patterson move to them.

				REDBEARD
		Starting now, we attack them.

				ABDULLAH
		How; we don't know where they are?

				REDBEARD
		We'll have to make them come to us,
		won't we? And since there are two of
		them, we're going to set two plans
		in motion.
			(to Hawthorne)
		First: we must move the entire
		hospital by tomorrow night.

				HAWTHORNE
			(appalled)
		That's a terrible idea-

				REDBEARD
			(backtracking)
		-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of
		course, you're the doctor, you 
		should know.

				HAWTHORNE
		Silliest thing I ever heard of- why
		in the world should we go through
		all that?

				REDBEARD
			(charming now)
		I suppose I could answer you. I
		suppose I could explain that the 
		place is so inviting, what with the 
		smell of blood and flesh, that they 
		have to strike. It's even possible 
		that I tell you I found some fresh 
		paw marks around back which means 
		they're already contemplating 
		feasting here.
			(Turning on Hawthorne
			now- his voice building)
		But I don't want to answer you 
		because when you question me you are 
		really saying that I don't have the 
		least idea what I am doing, that I am 
		nothing but an incompetent, that I am 
		a fool.
			(big)
		Anyone who finds me a fool, please 
		say so now.

				HAWTHORNE
			(The words burst out)
		I have been desperate for Patterson 
		to let me move the hospital since the 
		day he arrived.

				REDBEARD
			(nice smile)
		Then we agree.
			(And on that-)

BEGIN THE BUILDING SEQUENCE.

It was a huge effort and they got half of it done that day- but 
there was always the sense of impending bloodshed.

What we see first are Patterson and a bunch of shots of a lot of 
workers- laying out the dimensions of the new boma that would 
surround the place. This was to be by far the biggest wall fence 
they had in Tsavo.

And now here comes Abdullah leading a crowd of men, wading into a 
huge patch of thorn trees, cutting the thick branches down, 
starting to load them for carrying-

-and it's high noon now, and Patterson drenched with sweat, leads 
the start of the actual building- taking the thorn branches, 
bunching them together, forcing them so there is no room between 
them-

-and we can just begin to get the sense of what the fence will be- 
except at the moment it's barely a foot high-

-and now Redbeard appears, beckons to Patterson, and

CUT TO

A LONG SHOT OF A FLAT GRASSY PLAIN. AFTERNOON NOW.

Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel walk quickly.

CUT TO

SAMUEL turning to Redbeard and Patterson.

				SAMUEL
		Soon.
			(Redbeard nods)

				PATTERSON
			(to Redbeard)
		I have to ask- why do you need me?

				REDBEARD
		I don't really. But understand
		something- even though it may take
		me two or three days to sort this
		out-
			(Patterson has to smile
			at the phrase)
		-when I'm gone, you'll still have
		to build the bridge. And I don't
		want the men to have lost respect
		for you.

				PATTERSON
			(kind of surprised)
		That's very considerate.

				REDBEARD
		I'm always considerate- my mother
		taught me that.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, who just breaks out laughing.

				REDBEARD
		Why do you laugh?- you don't
		believe she taught me?

				SAMUEL
		I don't believe you had a mother.
			(And as Redbeard
			laughs too-)

CUT TO

A MASAI VILLAGE as they approach. Redbeard walks ahead.

				PATTERSON
		You like him, don't you?

				SAMUEL
		Oh yes. But it takes time.

				PATTERSON
		You've known him long?

				SAMUEL
			(He has)
		Since his beard was red.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE VILLAGE. AN AGED CHIEF RUNS THINGS.

Redbeard, Patterson and Samuel stand near him. WOMEN and CHILDREN 
are there. Some of the children look at Redbeard, mime shooting, 
fall down dead. Samuel translates as necessary.

				SAMUEL
		How many cattle?

				REDBEARD
		Four should do it.

				SAMUEL
		They will want a lot of money.

				PATTERSON
			(to Redbeard)
		Have you got it?

				REDBEARD
		No, but you do-
			(beat)
		-see, you were needed after all.
			(to Samuel)
		And fifty warriors at the camp
		before dawn.

				SAMUEL
			(Samuel explains. The
			Masai Chief replies.
			Translating)
		Why so many?

				REDBEARD
		Because I have two plans to kill
		the lions- one involving the cattle,
		the other the men.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON watching as Samuel tells the Chief.

CUT TO

THE MASAI CHIEF. He moves toward Redbeard and Patterson. As he 
speaks, Samuel translates quietly. There is a sadness in the 
Chief's tone.

				SAMUEL
			(translating)
		The Ghost and the Darkness have
		come... and we can do nothing...
		but if you anger them... they will
		stay in Tsavo... and life will
		become more unberable, that I know...

CUT TO

PATTERSON, watching as Redbeard replies.

				REDBEARD
			(beat)
		Two lions are all that have come...
		they're only lions, that I know.
			(beat)
		And I will kill them both tomorrow.
			(HOLD BRIEFLY, then-)

CUT TO

SHADOWS AND FIRELIGHT. IT'S NIGHT NOW.

We're not sure for a moment where we are but we can hear metallic 
sounds.

Now we hear voices.

				REDBEARD VOICE (over)
		I'll need you by me in the morning.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Whatever you wish.

CUT TO

WHERE WE ARE- IT'S PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. Patterson, Redbeard, 
Hawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire.

THey are cleaning their guns, getting ready.

A WORD ABOUT THEIR WEAPONS. Patterson's is a good rifle and he 
cleans it expertly.

Redbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest. And the way his hands move 
as he assembles it, he might be bathing a child.

Hawthorne is the least skilled of the three. But his rifle is 
clearly the finest. Bigger than the others, with great killing 
power.

There is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel 
show it. Redbeard is as before.

				HAWTHORNE
			(terribly tense)
		You're certain about tomorrow?
			(Redbeard is)
		But you don't seem excited.
			(Redbeard isn't)

				PATTERSON
		You don't enjoy killing, do you?
			(Redbeard doesn't)

				HAWTHORNE
		Then why do it?

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. He stares at the fire. Then-

				REDBEARD
		I have a gift.

CUT TO

THE CAMPFIRE. Silence for a moment except for the sound of the 
weapons being reassembled. Redbeard's hands fly. His rifle is back 
together. He stands, nods, goes.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, watching him.

				HAWTHORNE
		Strange man.
			(to Samuel)
		Has he always been this way?

				SAMUEL
		Much gentler now.

				HAWTHORNE
			(shakes his head on that)
		John?-
			(He holds out his
			beautiful rifle)
		Change guns with me- mine's much
		more powerful. I'll be finishing
		the hospital tomorrow so I won't
		be with you- but if you'll use
		this...
			(beat)
		...then I will.

Patterson, touched, changes weapons.

				PATTERSON
		Thank you.
			(He turns to Samuel)
		Why does he need you by him?

				SAMUEL
		He doesn't. He needs nobody. But
		we have hunted many times...
			(beat)
		...he knows I am afraid of lions...

HOLD ON THE FIRELIGHT UNTIL WE SHARPLY-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. BEFORE DAWN.

Misty- hard to see much.

Then GHOSTS appear-

KEEP HOLDING

-they're not ghosts, they're MASAI WARRIORS emerging from the 
mists. They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking 
equipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them 
materialize-

CUT TO

A HUGE THICKET.

Redbeard, Patterson, and Samuel wait as the Warriors approach.

				REDBEARD
			(whispered)
		I spotted one of them-
			(gesturing toward
			the thicket)
		-in there.

CUT TO

THE THICKET again- alive with thorn trees. Dark, filled with long 
dark shadows.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. A lot of tension.

				REDBEARD
		The best way to ensure the kill
		when you're using trackers is for
		one to shoot while the other uses
		the trackers to force the lion
		toward the shooter. Have you ever
		led trackers?

				PATTERSON
			(He hasn't)
		I can try.

				REDBEARD
			(no good)
		Samuel says you killed a lion.

				PATTERSON
		It was probably luck- I'd rather
		you did the shooting.

				REDBEARD
		You'd never force the lion to me-
		and nobody ever got a lion with
		one shot by luck.
			(points- hand out
			straight)
		Around there's a clearing- you'll
		know it from the anthills- get
		there and hide and listen to the
		sounds- I'll make the lion come
		directly to you.
			(He gestures for
			Patterson to take
			off and as he does-)

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS as Redbeard goes to them-

				REDBEARD
			(as Samuel translates)
		-all of you- spread the width of
		the clearing- no gaps- go-
			(claps his hands once)

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, spreading apart.

CUT TO

THE SUN. Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, running like hell.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, moving quickly, silently.

CUT TO

A THICK CLUSTER 0F THORN TREES.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, ducking his head, blasting through.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, starting to cover the entire width of the thicket.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, quickstepping over rocky terrain.

CUT TO

SAMUEL staying close to Redbeard. The fear is there.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, studying the position of the Warriors, who are almost 
ready.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, circling now, racing toward a clearing, picking up 
speed.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, spread out. They look to Redbeard.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Not yet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, racing into the clearing, glances around- lots of 
anthills.

CUT TO

AN ANTHILL, eight feet high. It casts a long shadow.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Holding Hawthorne's marvelous rifle, he slips silently 
into the shadow.

HOLD ON PATTERSON- it's almost as if he weren't there.

CUT SHARPLY TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Suddenly screaming and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, screaming too and

CUT TO

THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, suddenly moving forward, all of them 
shouting and screaming and pounding on their drums and it is loud.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in the shadow. The noise is faint- but he can hear it.

CUT TO

A DOZEN DRUMMERS, moving forward, banging away.

CUT TO

A DOZEN MORE DRUMMERS, even louder.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, moving forward, his eyes flicking ahead-

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Just the least bit louder now.

CUT TO

THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, screaming and pounding and

CUT TO

SAMUEL- the fear worse, dogging Redbeard's steps.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. His eyes flicking ahead.

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. It's a lot louder now. He's totally still. And he's 
ready.

CUT TO

THE DENSEST PART OF THE THICKET we've seen yet.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, slashing their way through, drumming and shouting 
and

CUT TO

REDBEARD, at their head, eyes, as always, flicking.

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

REDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point-

-because something is there-

CUT BACK TO

THE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw 
it before-

-but now something begins to move and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and 
they're starting to move faster and

CUT TO

PATTERSON IN THE SHADOW.

The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more 
distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we

CUT TO

A FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to 
move away from the sound-

-and toward where Patterson is waiting.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and

CUT TO

SAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON- he fingers the weapon.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now 
instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and

CUT TO

REDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors 
to get left and

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The 
Ghost's intended path and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and

CUT TO

REDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift 
the other way and

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's 
path again and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in 
the original direction- toward Patterson and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass 
hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and 
sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but 
you couldn't tell that from what they're doing-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware 
of Patterson's existence behind him.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the 
sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, backing toward Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, starting to turn.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, ready to fire.

CUT TO

THE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And 
now its lips go back as it sees Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he 
squeezes the trigger-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull 
snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, unharmed and

CUT TO

PATTERSON desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function 
and

CUT TO

THE GHOST. It stares at Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE GHOST-

-and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau-

-THEN THE GHOST ROARS-

CUT TO

REDBEARD as he hears it, breaking into a wild run-

				REDBEARD
		Shoot for chrissakes!-

CUT TO

PATTERSON standing his ground as now THE GHOST takes a step toward 
him.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the 
clearing and as he reaches it-

CUT TO

THE GHOST. Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and

CUT TO

REDBEARD's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot 
at the animal- he curses, races for a better position and

CUT TO

THE GHOST. One final stare at Patterson-

-then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket-

-and it's safe and free and gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Rocked.

The low point of his life.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, catching up to Redbeard.

				SAMUEL
		Did you ever see a lion that size?

				REDBEARD
		Not even close.
			(Now he moves to
			Patterson)
		What happened?

				PATTERSON
			(a whisper)
		...misfire... it jammed...

				REDBEARD
		Has it ever done that before?

				PATTERSON
		...don't know...

				SAMUEL
		It's Hawthorne's.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Trying for control.

				REDBEARD
		You exchanged weapons?
			(Patterson nods)
		You went into battle with an
		untried gun?
			(Patterson nods)

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's 
going to do. It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to 
happen.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Drained, he epects it. It's very quiet.

CUT TO

REEDBEARD, studying the younger man. And when he finally speaks, 
his voice is surprisingly quiet.

				REDBEARD
		They have an expression in
		prizefighting: "everyone has a plan

			(beat)
		You've just been hit...

		...the getting up is up to you...
			(And he turns, moves
			off and)

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL.

Nearly finished. The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is 
supervising men and material that are being transferred.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, checking security in the New Hospital which is close to 
the center of camp. (The Old Hospital was situated on the 
outskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the 
sick and the wounded.) Late afternoon, now.

Patterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him. As are TWO 
EXPERIENCED ORDERLIES, both armed with powerful rifles. Patterson 
is silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his 
face.

				REDBEARD
			(to the Orderlies)
		Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell
		at all here, and little blood. When
		we leave, close the gate securely,
		don't open it til morning and keep
		your fires high. Any questions, ask
		them now.
			(They understand- now
			to Samuel and Hawthorne)
		You two will sleep beautifully in
		your tents.
			(beat)
		And stay there.

				SAMUEL
		And where will you sleep beautifully?

				REDBEARD
			(smile)
		Patterson and I will be in the old
		hospital- where the enticing smell
		of sickness still lingers-
			(beat)
		-and by the time we're done, I
		promise you, the odor of blood will
		be irresistible.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL. STARTING TO GET DARK.

Redbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the 
inside perimeter-

-buckets of blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Darker. They empty still more full buckets 
of blood. Redbeard seems pleased.

CUT TO

SAMUEL AND HAWTHORNE, hurrying toward their camp.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, leading Masai cattle into the grounds of 
the Old Hospital.

CUT TO

THE ORDERLIES IN THE NEW HOSPITAL, firmly closing and locking the 
gate.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, just outside the fence of the Old 
Hospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as 
they move.

CUT TO

THE SUN. Dying... dying...

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They slip inside the deserted Old 
Hospital, pull the gate securely shut.

CUT TO

THE CATTLE. They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling 
to each other.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. Full. Clean. The men are exhausted. Most are 
already asleep. The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything.

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL. Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their 
fire, waiting. The cows are quiet.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE by his fire near his tent with Samuel. Nervously, they 
drink tea.

CUT TO

THE MOON. Higher. An hour has passed. Perhaps more.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Walking the fence perimeter.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The cows are edgy. He calms the cows.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE OLD HOSPITAL. The large chunks of meat are visible in 
the moonlight.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. The orderlies are calm.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, still walking the perimeter.

CUT TO

PATTERSON sitting by the fire, staring at the night. Redbeard 
moves to him, speaks in a whisper.

				REDBEARD
		Think about something else.

				PATTERSON
		Have you ever failed?

				REDBEARD
			(sad smile)
		Only in life...
			(He walks away.
			Patterson watches.)

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. The Orderlies tend the sick. Quietly.

CUT TO

THE NIGHT AND THE MOON. Lovely.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly 
quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from 
Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the 
ripping of flesh-

CAMERA MOVES UP

Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in 
shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat.

Redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for 
Patterson to switch positions with him.

As he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops.

Silence again.

Patterson reaches the far side of the fence.

Now the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are 
outside, directly across from Patterson.

CUT TO

REDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going 
on, it's sure as hell odd.

CUT TO

THE CATTLE- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out 
violently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just 
before The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one-

-now a different sound is heard: scratching-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD tracking the sound-

-the main gate is starting to be pushed in. Inside the gate the 
ground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their 
buckets.

CUT TO

THE GATE. More pressure against it- it could give way any moment.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON and from the look on Redbeard's face, this 
is it! Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we-

CUT TO

THE CATTLE, going nuts and then-

CUT TO

THE GATE. All pressure gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Patterson is furious.

				PATTERSON
		Goddammit!

				REDBEARD
		It's all right. Stay ready.
			(indicates the blood)
		They know it's there.

Patterson takes a few steps away, stares at the moon.

CUT TO

REDBEARD; he studies Patterson who so clearly craves redemption.

				REDBEARD
			(going to him)
		Meant to ask you- the railroad car
		trap. Your idea?
			(Patterson nods)
		Excellent notion- I used the same
		device myself once.

				PATTERSON
		But of course yours worked.

				REDBEARD
		In point of fact it didn't- but I'm
		convinced the idea is sound.

He goes back to walking the perimeter. Patterson watches him- and 
for the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to 
lift.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL

and an ORDERLY, blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the 
fire and

CUT TO

THE SECOND ORDERLY rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before 
he can scream-

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS suddenly beside him, and their giant 
paws slap out so fast we can't follow and

CUT TO

THE SECOND ORDERLY, dropping to the ground, and now we're starting 
to spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning.

CUT TO

A TENT FULL OF SICK MEN with malaria and

CUT TO

A PAW flashing and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, lips pulling back and

CUT TO

A SICK MAN, falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed 
face and

CUT TO

TWO MORE SICK MEN, trying to rise and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, leaping on them and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, eyes narrow and brilliant and

CUT TO

A SICK COOLIE, and he's terrified and he tries to scream-

-the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry 
we've heard and

CUT TO

THE ENTIRE CAMP, NIGHT, WITH ALL THE FIRES BURNING- AND 
PATTERSON'S TENT AREA IS CLOSE BY-

-but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, rifles ready- but no sound reaches them.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it 
and he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel 
does his best to stop him-

-but Hawthorne rips free and we

CUT TO

A SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and

CUT TO

THE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and

CUT TO

MEDICINE, flying across the tent and

CUT TO

GLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and

CUT TO

A BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those 
terrible bright blazing eyes and

CUT TO

A TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this: 
destroying the New Hospital and

CUT TO

MORE TENTS collapsing and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs.

CUT TO

SHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we

CUT TO

THE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring 
around-

CUT TO

THE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone-

-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New 
Hospital and the instant they are heard

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open 
and they're off as we

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) 
The tents are all down. The place is devastated.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on.

CUT TO

PAN ALONG THE TENT

Dead. Blood. Pain.

PAN TO THE SECOND TENT

More dead.

More dying.

It's a slaughterhouse.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his 
last.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at 
each other-

-then they slow.

Because the New Hospital has come into view.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, CLOSE UP, staring at the disaster.

And this terrible crosses his face. For a moment, you think he's 
going to fall. His body seems drained of all its power. He stands 
there. Just stands there. Unable to move.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. And he does move. Slowly. Carefully. Into the chaos.

He stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere. 
Hawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone.

All that's left now is this: the sound of pain.

HOLD.

Dust rises. It covers everything. Only the sound remains.

Now different sounds take over-

-an incredible babble of human voices.

AND A RAILROAD TRAIN.

Patterson walks through the dust. Samuel, a worried look on his 
face, is a few steps behind.

We are at the STATION AREA and it is jammed. A train has pulled 
into the station-

-only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are 
workers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber 
up onto the roofs of the cars-

-covering the cars-

-everyone is leaving-

-Patterson can only watch.

Abdullah stands on one of the cars-

-the train begins to pull out of the station.

More and more workers chase after it, get pulled on.

Now the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full.

Patterson still watches, eyes vacant.

Abdullah sees him, looks away.

The train gathers speed.

Rounds a corner...

...gone...

Patterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. Samuel stays close 
behind him, the worried look still there.

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL.

A FEW AFRICAN ORDERLIES do the best they can. Patterson watches 
only a moment, walks on. Samuel still behind him.

CUT TO

THE CAMP as Patterson walks through. A ghost town now. Only 
Africans remain.

CUT TO

THE CONTRAPTION where the coolies missed The Darkness. Patterson 
looks at it a moment, walks on.

CUT TO

THE ANTHILL IN THE CLEARING where Patterson misfired. Patterson 
looks at it a moment, walks on. And now, at last-

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his 
tent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson.

IT'S A NECKLACE OF LION CLAWS.

Patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he 
never takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE.

It stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a 
lot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon. 
Desolate.

Redbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as 
he did the night before.

Patterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven, 
wrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace.

For a moment, neither says a word. Then-

				REDBEARD
			(out of the blue)
		It would have been a beautiful 
		bridge, John. I never noticed 
		before, occupied with other 
		business, I	suppose...
			(He's rambling)
		...never really pay much attention
		to that kind of thing but I've had
		the time today, nothing else on,
		and this... it's graceful and the
		placement couldn't be prettier...
		and...
			(He goes silent now,
			stares off)

				PATTERSON
		You just got hit.
			(Redbeard nods)
		The getting up is up to you- but
		they're only lions-
			(beat)
		-and I'm going after them crack
		of dawn...
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

A LONG SHOT OF A HIGH ROCKY CLIFF-

-we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet 
tall- gorgeous early morning light.

As we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the 
cliff.

As we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.

THE DOTS are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the 
rock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of 
course, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind. 
They travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM as they make it over the cliff face. They stand, 
stare out.

CUT TO

WHAT THEY SEE: the world. They move on.

CUT TO

A RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if 
you fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on 
their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard 
starts to speak. They don't stop moving.

				REDBEARD
		In my town, when I was little,
		there was a brute, a bully who
		terrorized the place.
			(beat)
		But he was not the problem. He
		had a brother who was worse than
		he. But the brother was not the
		problem.
			(beat)
		One or the other of them was
		usually in jail. The problem came
		when they were both free togther.
		The two became different from
		either alone.
			(beat)
		Alone they were only brutes.
		Together they became lethal,
		together they killed.

				PATTERSON
		What happened to them?

				REDBEARD
			(pause)
		I got big.
			(They move on)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's 
hard going. They help each other.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now. 
Slow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points-

CUT TO

A TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it: 
there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used 
it as a regular passage.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a 
word move through it.

CUT TO

THE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: 
a cave.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. Dark.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward 
it.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside.

CUT TO

WHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low 
tunnel you have to half-crawl through.

Without a word, they start inside.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel. 
Ahead there is light. They move on.

CUT TO

THE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just 
a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear.

Now they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- 
dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's 
dank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Thunderstruck-

				REDBEARD
		Dear God-
			(And on those words-)

CUT TO

THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE. More copper bracelets. And still more-

-and now bones-

-the floor of the place is littered with human bones-

-eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones.

				PATTERSON
		Their den?
			(Redbeard nods)
		Have you ever seen anything like
		this?

				REDBEARD
		Nobody's seen anything like this.
		Lions don't have caves like this-
			(beat)
		-they're doing it for pleasure.

CUT TO

SEVERAL TUNNELS, dark and ominous, leading from the cave-

-and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels-

-something is coming close and coming fast and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the 
sound explodes-

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL-

-shrieks-

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. What the hell is it?

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL- and here they come, screeching and angry-

-bats-

-swarms of them- hundreds of them-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, diving to the ground, lying there amidst 
the bangles and the bones and the skulls-

CUT TO

THE BATS. Circling above them. Screeching louder.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, lying very still, eyeless skulls all 
around, staring.

CUT TO

THE BATS. For a moment, it seems as if they might attack.

CUT TO

PATTRSON AND REDBEARD. Waiting, waiting. Then-

CUT TO

THE BATS  back into the tunnel and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, scrambling to their feet.

				REDBEARD
		One of my chief attributes is that
		I'm always calm.

And then without warning, from behind them, a roar-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD spin around, start back toward the entrance 
of the cave-

CUT TO

THE LOW ENTRANCE TUNNEL as they scramble half-crawling through it.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE as they make it, stand straight, look around-

CUT TO

THICK BUSH beyond- another roar and sudden movement and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, entering the thick bush- but carefully, 
because they are vulnerable now and an attack could come from 
anywhere- there is the sound of water-

-slashes of light hit their eyes, making it hard to see- and 
they're totally vulnerable now but it doesn't stop them- the water 
sound gets stronger- and as they burst clear-

CUT TO

AN AMAZING PLACE- AN AREA OF FLAT ROCK SPLIT UP AHEAD BY A WIDE 
FAST-RUNNING WATERFALL.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They look around. Nothing is there. But 
the spot is wide open, exposed.

				PATTERSON
			(The words pour out)
		Where could it have gone? How
		could it get across the water?
			(looks at Redbeard)
		They're only lions, yes?

				REDBEARD
			(shakes his head; he
			doesn't know)
		Don't they have to be?...

They look around a moment more. Nothing to see-

-they turn, leave, re-enter the thick bush. And now-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS- who knows where it is but it's there-

-watching Patterson.

HOLD BRIEFLY on The Darkness, then-

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. JUST BEFORE DAWN-

-outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones.

Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen. 
Patterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the 
other.

				SAMUEL
			(pointing)
		Both of them over there.

He is pointing to Patterson's area. Patterson goes to Redbeard.

				PATTERSON
		Ever have to use a machan?
			(Redbeard hasn't)
		I did once. In India. We will 
		tonight.
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

A CLEARING. LATER IN THE DAY.

Patterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd 
looking structure: four slender poles lashed together, slanting 
inward with a plank tied on top, a dozen feet up in the air. 
Redbeard and Samuel approach.

				PATTERSON
		They're used to people in trees,
		not in a clearing.
			(indicating the plank)
		It may be tight.

				REDBEARD
		Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's
		your idea, you go up there.
			(to Samuel)
		Take the others to the water tower
		for the night.

				PATTERSON
		I'll be bait alone?

				REDBEARD
		Yes. And I'll be in some distant
		tree where I can provide no
		assistance whatsoever.
			(beat)
		Can you control your fear?

				PATTERSON
		I'll have to.

				REDBEARD
		I can't control mine- I'd be lost
		without the shame factor driving me.

				PATTERSON
		Was that supposed to make me feel
		better?
			(Redbeard doesn't
			reply. Now-)

CUT TO

A DONKEY BEING LED IN. LATER.

THE MEN start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan.

Patterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support 
poles- they're rickety.

CUT TO

DUSK. The sun quickly beginning its quick fall.

CUT TO

THE WATER TOWER IN THE STATION AREA. Samuel is with the remaining 
men who clamber up to the platform on top.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY IN THE CLEARING. Quiet.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Redbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the 
plank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous.

CUT TO

THE PLANK as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages 
to sit.

CUT TO

THE VIEW. Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get 
comfortable. He can't.

				REDBEARD
			(glancing around)
		It's certainly the best chance
		they've had to kill you.

				PATTERSON
		You think they'll come then?
			(Redbeard does)
		Why?

				REDBEARD
			(not answering)
		Good luck.

				PATTERSON
		Why?

				REDBEARD
			(beat)
		Because I think they're after you.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to 
leave.

				PATTERSON
		How many do you think they've 
		killed?

				REDBEARD
			(reluctantly)
		The most of any lions... a 
		hundred...?
			(beat)
		Probably more.
			(Now Redbeard looks
			up at the younger man)
		Johnny...?

They study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been 
through a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when 
they first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand.

				REDBEARD
		Don't fuck up.
			(And he turns, never
			looks back, just goes)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He is alone now.

CUT TO

SHADOWS. Growing longer.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. It peers around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel-

-there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, 
the world could explode.

CUT TO

THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees. 
Nothing unusual.

MOVE IN CLOSER:

Redbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches.

CUT TO

THE SUN. About to die.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He 
stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, 
giving it color.

CUT TO

THE SUN and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just 
set, it literally drops out of the sky. Suddenly it's bright and 
in a blink it isn't. As it drops-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. It's madness that he's up here. And he knows 
it. And that shows.

CUT TO

THE SKY. No moon. Just thick cloud.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. Quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. On his precarious perch. He scans constantly ahead of 
him past the donkey.

CUT TO

THE THICK BUSH BEYOND THE DONKEY. Nothing moves-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He swallows, moistening his throat. He stares down at 
the donkey.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. LATER. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DARK.

And now, just the beginning of a mist.

CUT TO

THE SKY. THICKER AND THICKER CLOUDS. LATER STILL. GETTING TOWARD 
MORNING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends, 
listening for something, anything-

-but all there is is silence.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. It lies still and quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to 
scream.

CUT TO

THE BUSHES AROUND HIM. The mist is getting stronger.

CUT TO

REDBEARD in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing 
mist.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, listening, listening-

-and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear 
it but to Patterson it might as well be thunder-

-from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a 
twig.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY, and it's eyes widen-

HOLD ON THE DONKEY.

Because now something happens that hasn't happened before: 
suddenly there are no colors, only tones-

-because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's 
happening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of 
the lion-

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE EYES OF THE GHOST. Watching the donkey.

And from now on, when we are using PATTERSON'S POINT OF VIEW, 
everything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted.

When we are using THE GHOST'S POINT OF VIEW, everything is totally 
clear- and sounds are thunderous.

CUT TO

WHAT PATTERSON SEES: just mist and vaguely, bushes.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey. And CAMERA begins to move closer 
as The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be 
some movement in the bushes.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey, very, very close-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but 
the mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: THE DONKEY.

HOLD.

Now there is something else visible, something behind the donkey: 
the four legs of the platform.

HOLD.

Now we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together.

HOLD AS THE GHOST AT LAST SEES PATTERSON.

CUT TO

THE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts-

-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around 
the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He 
half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is 
behind him.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to 
change.

CUT TO

PATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about 
the donkey anymore, it's stalking him.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, 
always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know 
he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do 
anything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the 
lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite 
seen.)

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to 
let the animal's position out of his sight.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer...

CUT TO

PATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come 
apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on 
turning.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- 
that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, 
almost knocking him off the plank and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and 
he's trying not to fall and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and 
as he starts his leap-

CUT TO

REDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing 
his rifle, firing again and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, 
lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes 
and the night has him and

CUT TO

SUDDEN DAWN AND PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, running, stopping, staring 
at the ground-

CUT TO

THE GROUND. Blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving quickly forward again-

CUT TO

THE GROUND. More blood and...

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM, starting to slow-

CUT TO

STRANGE TERRAIN- huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen, 
some of them fifteen feet high, some even higher.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They separate, take different paths 
through the anthills.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Alert. One step at a time.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The same. One step at at time.

CUT TO

THE GHOST. Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, 
staring down at them both.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they 
might be statues.

CUT TO

THE ROCKY GROUND. Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them 
and as he does-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, launched in mid-air and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, in mid-air, body twisted and-

-and FREEZE.

Freeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky.

HOLD. THen-

CUT TO

SAMUEL, WALKING INTO THE SHOT-

-we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment 
when the three men brought the old man-eater into camp-

-only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the 
actual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead 
animal to the ground-

CUT TO

THE GHOST- and now there's a flash of light as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

BEAUMONT, kneeling by the dead animal. He is smiling beautifully, 
and there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face.

CUT TO

A PHOTOGRAPHER; loads of bulky equipment. Patterson and Redbeard 
stand behind him, watching him. We're in a lovely spot by the 
river. Patterson and Redbeard have definitely been drinking.

				BEAUMONT
		I think another for posterity-
		this is an important moment in
		my life.

He strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work.

				BEAUMONT
		Understand, I had help-

				PATTERSON
		-not a time for modesty, Bob-

				REDBEARD
		-undeniably your triumph.

				BEAUMONT
		Oh surely there's enough credit
		for us all- let's not forget, you
		did the actual shooting. Of course,
		I hired you, I was the general who
		put the team together. And generals
		are the ones who tend to be
		remembered.

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Perhaps you might put your head in
		its mouth, sir- could be a corker.

				BEAUMONT
		Clever idea, I like it.

CUT TO

THE MOUTH OF THE GHOST- it is huge-

-Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the 
enormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we

CUT TO

REDBEARD suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and

CUT TO

BEAUMONT, surprised and frightened-

-he jerks his head away-

-there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's-

-Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, 
humiliated, and as the laughter builds-

CUT TO

THE TENT AREA. NIGHT.

Patterson and Redbeard flank a fire. It's a sweet moment for them, 
their first, no fear in the vicinity.

It should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of 
champagne.

It should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away 
from the young man who went to meet Beaumont. He's unshaven, his 
eyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure- 
he is more at ease with the world.

				PATTERSON
			(drunk)
		I never thought I'd say this, but
		I'm glad you came.

				REDBEARD
			(drunk)
		Understood- you realize now you
		could never have done it without
		me.

				PATTERSON
		Actually, I could have done it
		much more easily without you, but
		for whatever reason, I'm glad you
		came.
			(They toast each other)

Samuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins 
them.

				SAMUEL
			(drunk)
		Where do you go next?

				REDBEARD
		Some Russian princes want to hunt
		the Himalayas. You?

				SAMUEL
		Help finish the railroad.

				PATTERSON
		I want to meet my son- he must be
		what, two months old?

They look at the fire a moment. Then-

				SAMUEL
		Three years I've worked for the
		railroad. Now I don't know why. It
		seemed a good idea once.

				PATTERSON
		I feel the same about the bridge.
		This country certainly didn't ask
		for it, doesn't need it.

				REDBEARD
		Too soon to tell.

They look at him.

				REDBEARD
		My life was shaped because someone
		invented gunpowder. Our lives have
		crossed because two lions went mad.
		But what if in the future the three
		of us do something grand for
		humanity? Was that worth all the
		lives? Too soon to tell.

				SAMUEL
			(drinks)
		Some mysteries should not have 
		solutions.

				REDBEARD
			(finishes his bottle,
			rises, looks at Patterson)
		Hold your son high.
			(And he turns, goes
			to his tent)

				PATTERSON
			(beat- quietly)
		He has children?

				SAMUEL
			(beat- quietly)
		Once...
			(HOLD on the two
			in the firelight. Then-)

CUT TO

THE STATION MASTER AT TSAVO STATION, WORKING IN HIS OFFICE. THE 
NEXT DAY.

				FEMALE VOICE (over)
		I'd like to see John Patterson,
		please.
			(As he looks up-)

CUT TO

HELENA standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but 
still lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is 
adorable.

				HELENA
		Could you tell him that his wife-
			(catches herself, smiles)
		-that his family has come to see him.
			(On that-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news- 
Patterson takes off running and

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back 
and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all 
but her heels.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station 
area.

CUT TO

HELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the 
building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, excitedly waving back and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly screaming "Get back- back-"

CUT TO

HELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- 
she smiles again, waves again and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, "GET BACK" and

CUT TO

HELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the 
same, she stops and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child.

CUT TO

HELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, starting to run and

CUT TO

PATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get 
there, he's never going to get there-

CUT TO

HELENA, and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she 
turns-

-but too late, too late as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, flying toward her now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, in agony.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as 
Helena cries out helplessly-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, crying out helplessly and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON IN HIS TENT,

continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had 
is over-

-he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE. It's dawn. Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the 
dream. He looks around.

Redbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it-

CUT TO

INSIDE THE TENT. It's empty. Patterson stares around-

-there is blood on the tent floor and quickly-

CUT TO

THE SUN. RISING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON running wildly, rifle in hand and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash 
across a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do, 
widening the area of search and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, veering off and

CUT TO

THORN TREES, as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the 
damage to his clothes or his skin and

CUT TO

MORE THORNS- he plunges wildly ahead and

CUT TO

A LARGE ANTHILL- it seems to be casting an unusual shadow- 
Patterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it-

-nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working 
overtime and is only getting worse-

Patterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do-

-and then SAMUEL'S VOICE on the wind- calling to him-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again, 
louder-

-Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend-

CUT TO

A FIELD OF WHITE GRASS. So lovely.

With one patch in the middle that is blood red.

Something is moving in the blood red area.

Patterson has his rifle ready-

-and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen 
something beyond imagination.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to 
where Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down 
into the grass-

-clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead. Patterson and 
Samuel stare mute at one another-

-and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar 
of The Darkness. They don't even react.

CUT TO

FLAMES RISING IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.

We should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this 
before.

START PULLING BACK.

Samuel stands there, trying to hold it together.

KEEP PULLING BACK.

Patterson stands there too, trying to hold it together.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

REDBEARD'S FUNERAL PYRE. Flames consume the body.

Just Patterson and Samuel. No one else is there.

The flames lick at the sky...

HOLD...

CUT TO

A LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING 
DARK NOW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use 
at the bridge, not far from the baboon.

				PATTERSON
		You're positive lions hate baboons?
			(Samuel is)
		Pebbles?
			(Samuel holds up a bag)
		Let's get it over with.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, 
fifteen feet from the baboon.

They help each other into position. Almost night.

CUT TO

THE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into 
the darkness.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble 
toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but 
irritation-

CUT TO

THE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S 
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

They're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries 
out.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; 
only nervous energy is keeping him going now.

CUT TO

THE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and 
frightening black clouds gather and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky 
is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to 
hallucinate.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM.

Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.

CUT TO

THE RIVER, raging and black and lethal.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, hallucinating again.

CUT TO

JUST BEFORE DAWN

and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge 
toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Firing-

CUT TO

-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and-

CUT TO

-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, 
turning back, ready to fire again-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS- gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around.

				PATTERSON
		Where is it?

				SAMUEL
			(pointing down)
		Underneath.
			(beat)
		Somewhere.

CUT TO

WHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes 
several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run.

They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we

CUT TO

EARLY MORNING LIGHT.

Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to 
the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson 
releases the baboon which races away.

CUT TO

WHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began 
construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away 
before them.

CUT TO

They begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully...

..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, 
making sure they miss nothing.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Ready for anything.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE up ahead of them. There are some holes.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL slowing.

CUT TO

THE HOLES. The nearest one is the largest.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. It seems empty.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. One step forward. Another. They hold their 
breaths.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. It seems empty.

CUT TO

A SHOT FROM BELOW BRIDGE LEVEL- The Darkness is there.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, firing.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, going down through another level of scaffolding.

CUT TO

PATTRSON AND SAMUEL, trying to track it.

CUT TO

THE SCAFFOLDING. Nothing is visible.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL- Frozen. They listen-

-nothing but their breathing.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, looking around everywhere.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. Nothing.

CUT TO

THE FIRST LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

CUT TO

THE SECOND LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, looking this way, that way.

SHOCK CUT TO

THE HOLE AS THE DARKNESS JUST FUCKING FLIES OUT OF IT- Patterson 
falls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it 
gets up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning for Samuel's rifle-

-only Samuel isn't there-

-he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS ROARING AND

CUT TO

PATTERSON and he turns, starts running too, running across the 
narrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without 
slipping or falling and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it 
takes off after Patterson and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the 
nearest tree and

CUT TO

PATTERSON running for his life across the bridge and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a 
dead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary 
speed, it's still faster than Patterson and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and he's never gone this fast in his life and

CUT TO

THE TREE HE'S HEADED FOR, a different one from Samuel's and it's 
just up ahead and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, closing and

CUT TO

THE TREE, and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, springing into the air now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both 
hands, swinging his body up as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the 
branch and now comes this insane roar and

CUT TO

SAMUEL with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen 
feet up.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's 
tree, raging with frustration.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks 
across at the next tree not far away where Samuel is-

				SAMUEL
			(embarrassed)
		Afraid of lions.

CUT TO

PATTERSON.

				PATTERSON
		It's all right, Samuel- we all
		get hit-
			(Now he shuts up 
			fast and-)

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb 
the tree after Patterson. Lions are cats and when they want to 
climb, up they go and that's what The Darkness is doing now, going 
up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and it's terrifying- he reaches for the branch above, 
climbing higher and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there 
is a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, going still higher but the branches are getting thinner 
and the tree is shaking, and he could fall-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, climbing on, nothing can stop it-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS, together in the tree, and there's no 
further Patterson can go and it's harder for The Darkness too, but 
slowly it moves in and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, calling out-

				PATTERSON
		Samuel!
			(And he gestures for
			the rifle and the
			instant he does-)

CUT TO

SAMUEL, and he takes the rifle between his two hands and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, steadily moving in and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, tossing the rifle with great care and Patterson's less 
than fifteen feet away and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, hands out to catch it and

CUT TO

THE RIFLE in mid-air and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, both hands ready and

CUT TO

THE RIFLE as it strikes a tree branch, spins away to the ground.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, almost on Patterson now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly leaping out of the tree, and yes it's a long 
way and sure it's going to damage him but sometimes there aren't a 
lot of choices in this world and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, staring as Patterson falls and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, crashing hard to earth, stunned, hurt, ribs broken, leg 
broken and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and it's so big it's hard for it to get room to turn 
but it does and

CUT TO

PATTERSON crawling for the rifle, and he's in terrible pain but he 
reaches the weapon, grabs for it and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, skittering down the tree and as it reaches the 
ground

CUT TO

PATTERSON, forcing himself to his feet and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its 
charge.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, aims, fires and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, hit again and down it goes again but up it comes 
again and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, firing the final shot and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, hit again and it has to stop, it just has to-

-but it doesn't.

It roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON; all bullets gone, no place to hide.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS. Still moving forward.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a 
branch, lands hard and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now 
four, now-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, helpless on the ground.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and the eyes glow-

-a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge 
teeth into the branch-

-now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Can't breathe.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. And suddenly he just empties and tears pour 
down his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with 
sobs. He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS. Just the sound of Patterson's tears...

HOLD.

KEEP HOLDING.

CAMERA BEGINS TO RISE-

-WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BRIDGE NOW- AND IT'S FINISHED!

-hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it-

-Samuel is there- lighting up the world with his smile-

-and Patterson's there, too. He stands with Helena, his young son 
in his arms.

Everybody smiles, everybody waves, the train goes triumphantly by.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He looks wonderful again, vibrant and young. Watching 
him, you might think he hadn't been through the nightmare as he 
stands there, holding the boy tightly.

But with his other hand, he fingers the lion claw necklace...

HOLD ON PATTERSON.

Now slowly dissolve to an African evening. Animals stretch from 
one horizon to the other.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Here we still wonder about them.
		How did they escape for nine months?
		And kill 135 men? And stop the
		railroad?
			(beat)
		And were they only lions?
			(beat)
		If you want to decide for yourself,
		you must go to America. They are at
		the Field Museum in Chicago, and
		even now, after they have been dead
		a century, if you dare to lock eyes
		with them...
			(beat)
		...you will be afraid.

In the distance, the animals continue to move.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Sleep well.

HOLD ON THE ANIMALS. They seem to go on forever...

FINAL FADE OUT.


THE END
"THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS"

by

William Goldman



FADE IN ON

A TINY FIGURE OF A MAN hurrying toward camera. The figure gets 
larger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or 
where we are.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		This is the most famous true story
		of Africa. It happened a hundred
		years ago, but even now, when
		children ask about it, you do not
		tell them at night.
			(The FIGURE continues 
			to grow)
		It began with the race to build a
		railroad across Africa.
			(beat)
		But this is not about building a
		railroad- it is about Patterson.

And now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious, 
serious about his life, serious about his career. He has been 
successful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his 
talents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody.

AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND.

More specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant 
building - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat, 
everything is clean and in order.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		Patterson was thirty. A brilliant
		engineer. A fine man, but do not
		become attached to him- there are
		many fine men in this story but do
		not become attached to any of them.
			(beat)
		So many of them die.

Patterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks. Waits.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		And remember this: only the
		impossible parts of what follows
		really happened...
			(Now the door opens
			and we-)

CUT TO

Just a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway. This is 
ROBERT BEAUMONT - 40, with an irresistable smile. We're in his 
office and the place reflects the man - clean, cold. There are 
maps and charts on the walls. He ushers Patterson inside.

				BEAUMONT
			(The great smile flashes)
		John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm
		Robert Beaumont.
			(They shake hands)
		Firm- I like that, tells me a lot
		about you-
			(beat)
		-now why don't you tell me about me?
		To get you started, many people find
		me handsome, with a wonderful smile.
		I'm sure you agree.
			(Surprised, uncomfortable,
			Patterson nods)
		Winning personality, heaps of charm?

				PATTERSON
		My wife is the game player in the
		family, sir.

				BEAUMONT
		Games?
			(staring dead at Patterson)
		Look at me closely, Patterson: I am
		a monster. My only pleasure is
		tormenting people who work for me,
		such as yourself.
			(again the smile - only
			now it's chilling)
		One mistake and I promise you this:
		I'll make you hate me.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he realizes Beaumont is serious. Beaumont turns 
sharply and moves to a large map.

CUT TO

THE MAP. It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear 
line that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles.

				BEAUMONT
			(pointing along the line)
		We are building this railroad
		across Africa for the glorious
		purpose of saving Africa from the
		Africans. And, of course, to end
		slavery. The Germans and French
		are our competition. We are ahead,
		and we will stay ahead providing
		you do what I hired you to do-

CUT TO

A MORE DETAILED MAP. This one ends at "Tsavo," 130 miles in.

				BEAUMONT
		-build the bridge over the Tsavo
		river. And be finished in four
		months time. Can you do that?

				PATTERSON
		I'm sure you've examined my record.
		So you know I've never yet been
		late on a bridge.

				BEAUMONT
		You've never built in Africa.

				PATTERSON
		But I have in India- every country
		presents problems.

				BEAUMONT
		You'll need your confidence, I
		promise you.

				PATTERSON
		I've got a reason far beyond
		confidence: my wife is having our
		firstborn in five months and I
		promised I'd be with her when the
		baby comes.

				BEAUMONT
		Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched
		you confided in me.
			(beat)
		But I don't really give a shit about
		your upcoming litter. I've made you
		with this assignment-
			(the smile)
		-don't make me break you.

				PATTERSON
			(smiling right back)
		You won't have the chance.
			(glancing at his watch)
		Any further words of encouragement?
			(silence)
		Then I've a train to catch.

They look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear 
they do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we

CUT TO

A RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER

A train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise. 
Patterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around.

CUT TO

HELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the 
kind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not 
begun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into 
his arms.

				HELENA
		I tried to be late, John- it would
		have been easier if you'd gone.

				PATTERSON
			(They are nutty about
			each other - he nods)
		We're not much good at goodbyes, 
		Helena.

				HELENA
			(brightly)
		Tell me about Beaumont- does he
		understand how brilliant you are,
		how lucky he is to have you?

				PATTERSON
		It was embarrassing- the man showered
		me with compliments.

They start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a 
quieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious-

				HELENA
		Oh dear-
			(beat)
		-you're geting that downtrodden look
		again-

				PATTERSON
		-well, it's just...
			(beat)
		...other men don't abandon their wives
		at such a time-

				HELENA
			(not unkindly)
		-oh please- if I'd been against your
		taking this, you would have abandoned
		me. You've been desperate to see Africa
		your whole life.

				PATTERSON
		What if there are complications?-

				HELENA
		-not "what if"- there will be, there
		always are. Which only means that our
		"son" and I- note my confidence- will
		have an excuse to come visit.

THE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds.

				HELENA
		Go, now.
			(He kisses her hand)
		Such a gentleman.
			(Now he holds her)

				PATTERSON
		I am desperate to see Africa- but I
		hate the leaving.

CUT TO

HELENA. She hates it, too.

				HELENA
		You build bridges, John-
			(beat)
		-you've got to go where the rivers are.

They hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into 
each other's arms a final time, then-

CUT TO

THE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam-

-Patterson runs into the clouds and disappears.

HOLD FOR A MOMENT.

KEEP HOLDING.

Patterson runs out of the steam and we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A DIFFERENT TRAIN, A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, A DIFFERENT WORLD.

This is the train to TSAVO and Patterson is alone on the engine 
seat- a wooden bench in front of the engine used by railroad 
inspectors and visiting VIPs. Behind it is a white circular piece 
of wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers.

CUT TO

NIGEL STARLING, running as best as he can alongside the train, 
trying to pull himself up onto the engine seat.

STARLING is a terribly appealing young man. Clothes do not fit him 
well, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that 
shirttail, trying to get things right. He wears glasses, tends 
nonetheless to squint at the world. He is, above all, a good man, 
morally impeccable and very much a product of these Victorian 
times.

				STARLING
			(as Patterson helps
			him aboard)
		Many thanks.
			(squints)
		You're Patterson, yes?
			(Patterson nods)
		Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you
		at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must
		have told you that.

				PATTERSON
		He just gave me his "monster" speech.

				STARLING
		That. I know Robert seems dreadful, 
		but when you truly get to know the man,
		well, he's much worse.
			(beat)
		And I'm one of his defenders.
			(Patterson smiles)
		Forget him for now- it's your first
		ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it
		breathtaking.
			(And on that word-)

CUT TO

STARLING coughing like crazy, hands over his face which is caked 
with dust- he and Patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary 
desert.

				PATTERSON
			(shouting toward Starling)
		"Breathtaking" doesn't begin to do it
		justice.
			(As Starling starts to
			laugh, his mouth opens
			and sand flies in, and
			his coughing fit returns
			and)

CUT TO

THE DESERT. ENDLESS. LATER IN THE DAY.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM, bent over, arms covering their faces as the dust 
gets worse- a wind has kicked up.

CUT TO

THE TRAIN, TRYING TO MAKE IT UP A STEEP GRADE. STILL LATER.

Patterson and Starling are walking beside the train now, helping 
to push it, trudging through the dust. All the other passengers 
spread out behind them, also pushing- the train obviously needs 
all the assistance it can get.

CUT TO

INSIDE A RAILROAD CAR, EARLY EVENING.

Patterson and Starling, filthy, sit together. Starling has nodded 
off. Patterson has a book open in his lap-

-we can tell there are drawings of African animals- not all that 
accurate.

Now Patterson's eyes close and he sleeps.

CUT TO

THE TRAIN POUNDING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

Stokers shovel coal. They are exhausted but they keep at it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. WAKING IN THE CAR, RUBBING HIS EYES. IT'S DAWN.

He stares out-

-and from his face it's clear something special has happened. And 
now, at last-

CUT TO

SOMETHING SPECIAL- and what it is, of course, is Patterson's first 
view of the Africa of his imagination.

Because the desert has ended, and now there are grasses and trees 
and one more thing-

-bursts of animals. On both sides of the train.

A flock of birds materializes here, a cluster of gazelles doing 
there amazing leap there.

Patterson is like a kid in a candy store.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, back outside in the engine seat again. 
Starling points-

				STARLING
		Aren't they amazing?

CUT TO

WHAT HE'S POINTING AT: Some giraffes running along, their absurd 
shape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly 
long strides.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, staring out.

				PATTERSON
		You know the most amazing thing
		about them?- they only sleep five
		minutes a day.
			(Starling glances at him-
			clearly, he didn't know that)

CUT TO

A FAMILY OF HYENAS. Close by, loping in their scary way.

				STARLING
		Don't much like them.

				PATTERSON
			(nods)
		The females are bigger- only animal
		here like that- have to be or they
		wouldn't survive because the males
		eat the young.

CUT TO

STARLING studying Patterson. Clearly, he didn't know that, either.

CUT TO

SOME HIPPOS moving along. Starling turns to Patterson.

				STARLING
		Anything special about them?

				PATTERSON
		Just that they fart through their
		mouths.
			(beat)
		Must make kissing something of a
		gamble.

				STARLING
			(laughs)
		I've lived in Africa a year and I
		don't know what you know. How long
		have you been here?

				PATTERSON
			(looks at his watch)
		Almost three hours.
			(beat)
		But I've been getting ready all my
		life.
			(Now, from them-)

CUT TO

A BUNCH OF IMPOVERISHED-LOOKING NATIVE WOMEN. They hold children 
who wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished 
looking than their mothers.

				STARLING
			(suddenly touched)
		Every time I see something like that,
		I know we're right to be here- to
		bring Christianity into their lives,
		enrich their souls.

				PATTERSON
		Beaumont says it's to end slavery.

				STARLING
			(shrugs)
		We all have our reasons. Mine is 
		simply to make them understand 
		happiness, accept salvation, know the 
		serenity that comes-
			(interrupts himself)
		-best I stop. One of the by-products 
		of my belief is that I can become 
		amazingly boring. But I know God smiles 
		on me.

				PATTERSON
			(They really like each other)
		Have you got that in writing?
			(Starling, amazingly good
			natured, laughs. And now-)

CUT TO

A WHITE CLAW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Hundreds of white claws.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

They aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and 
they're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree.

And there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in 
with other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked 
red rocks-

-now the train begins to slow.

Smoke drifts across.

A bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks.

				STARLING (over)
		Welcome to Tsavo.
			(on the word)

CUT TO

TSAVO.

We have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a 
place that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water 
tower is under construction-

-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for 
work.

THE TRAIN goes slower still.

No one stands idly around here.

But no one looks happy either.

ONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL.

An ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light 
the world.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train.

				STARLING
			(indicating Samuel,
			who is approaching)
		Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely
		indispensable- the only man here
		everyone trusts.

				PATTERSON
			(softly)
		Does he speak English?

				SAMUEL
			(not softly enough)
		And very poor French.

				STARLING
			(introducing)
		Samuel- John Patterson.

				SAMUEL
			(as they shake)
		The bridgebuilder-
			(gesturing to the 
			working men)
		-we have been getting ready for 
		you.

				PATTERSON
		Excellent. Could I see the bridge
		site?
			(Samuel nods)

				STARLING
		I've got medical supplies to
		deliver. Come along to the hospital
		when you're done.
			(starting off)

				SAMUEL
		I will bring him, Nigel.

We should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at 
the very beginning of the picture.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower.

Standing on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely 
powerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH.

WORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead, 
some SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling.

				PATTERSON
		Why do the workers look unhappy?

				SAMUEL
		Because they are here.
			(beat)
		Because Tsavo is the worst place in
		the world.
			(He points ahead)
		Come, John- to the bridge.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along.

CUT TO

THE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it.

And here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot 
where the movie takes place was like.

There were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived 
in a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have 
come from the same town back in their country might choose to live 
in one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another 
cluster.

What we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are 
dozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, 
these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.)

The places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's 
living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where 
the bridge is to be built, etc., etc.

As they move, Samuel points out various camps.

A SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer.

ANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating.

A GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area.

Anyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a 
wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more.

Okay, back to the story.

				PATTERSON
			(as they pass the INDIAN
			tent area where prayer is
			starting)
		It's all wonderfully under control,
		Samuel- you've done a splendid job.

				SAMUEL
		Thank you. The truth is this: you
		have to work at it constantly.

				PATTERSON
		The workers don't get on?

				SAMUEL
		Get on? They detest each other.
		Obviously the Africans hate the
		Indians. But the Indians also hate
		the other Indians. Some of them
		worship cows, while others eat them.
			(As they move on)

CUT TO

RAILROAD TRACK.

PAN ALONG TO

MORE RAILROAD TRACK.

KEEP PANNING

And suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL standing high above the Tsavo River. The 
track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where 
it just stops-

-and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words, 
is the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of 
track.

				SAMUEL
			(to the far side)
		Railhead is across there.

CUT TO

THE DISTANCE. Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great 
clouds of dust.

				SAMUEL
		Three thousand men laying track- when
		the bridge is done, it all joins up.

Patterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at 
the space where the bridge is to be.

				SAMUEL
		Did it look like this in your mind?

				PATTERSON
			(shakes his head)
		This is more difficult-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Excited.

				PATTERSON
			(eyes bright)
		-but how wonderful that it's 
		difficult, it should be difficult- 
		what better job in all the world
		than build a bridge?- make things
		connect- bring worlds together- and
		get it right!
			(Now from Patterson-)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL TENT

as Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around-

-it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured 
or with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, 
everything is working well, everything is under control. Starling 
approaches.

				STARLING
		Finish your tour?

				PATTERSON
			(nods)
		And anxious to get started.
			(indicating the hospital)
		What is this, mostly malaria?

				STARLING
		Yes- but their suffering is only
		transitory- once they except God
		into their hearts, He will vanquish
		all pain.

				MAN'S VOICE (over)
		That's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the
		poor bastards will relapse if you keep
		on that way.
			(As they turn-)

CUT TO

DOCTOR DAVID HAWTHORNE. A tough, middle-aged cockney. And a heavy 
drinker. A man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years.

				HAWTHORNE
			(to Patterson)
		I'm David Hawthorne, this is my
		hospital. And my advice to you is,
		"don't get sick in front of it."
			(beat)
		That was meant to be charming, 
		sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.

				STARLING
		You never had it.

				HAWTHORNE
		Nigel and I don't like each other much.

				SAMUEL
			(breaking the tension)
		I am also liaison between these two.

				PATTERSON
			(to Hawthorne)
		Clearly you don't agree about building
		the railroad?

				HAWTHORNE
		This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it?
		It's only being built to control the
		ivory trade, make men richer.

				PATTERSON
		Then why do you stay?

				HAWTHORNE
		Who else would hire me?
			(to Starling)
		Beat you to it, didn't I?
			(beat)
		Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a
		little welcoming gift.
			(Now he gestures and we-)

CUT TO

A NERVOUS ORDERLY who approaches them. He has been freshly 
bandaged across one shoulder.

				HAWTHORNE
		This is Karim, one of my orderlies-
		attacked by a man-eater earlier
		today- first incident of that kind
		here.

Patterson says not a word, just studies the wounded man.

				STARLING
			(incredulous)
		A man-eater attacks and you're such
		a buffoon you almost forget to mention
		it?

				HAWTHORNE
		Well, he got away, didn't he?
			(to Patterson)
		Riding a donkey not far from here 
		when the lion sprang on them- donkey 
		took the brunt of it- then suddenly 
		the lion ran off.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Listening. No emotion on his face.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. He's kind of enjoying this. Bearing down.

				HAWTHORNE
		I know it's your first day and of
		course you must be tired from the
		journey-
			(beat)
		-but what are you going to do about
		it?

				PATTERSON
			(a long pause, then evenly-)
		Karim will have to show me where it
		happened. And of course, I'll need
		the donkey.
			(beat)
		With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
			(And he walks out, leaving
			an astonished Starling
			staring after him)

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA

Starling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne. And 
there are half a dozen ORDERLIES.

Right now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent. 
Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches.

				STARLING
		I couldn't believe it when you said
		"sort it out." As if it were the most
		normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum,
		what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a
		killer beast this evening, nothing
		much else going on anyway."

				PATTERSON
		Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he?
		But that's all right- after all, I'm
		responsible for everything that happens
		here. And it certainly won't do much
		for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.

He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. 
There is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY 
COUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with 
precision. He arranges his books precisely too.

Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order.

				STARLING
			(calling out)
		You said "of course" you'd need the
		donkey. Why "of course"?

				PATTERSON
			(taking a rifle,
			moving outside)
		We know three things about man-eaters.
		First, they always return to where
		they've attacked before. Second, they're
		always old- they can't catch other 
		animals so they turn to us. And third,
		they're always alone- they've been cast
		out by their pride because they can't
		keep up.

CUT TO

STARLING, sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited. 
But also a bit reluctant.

				STARLING
		I don't suppose I could watch.

				PATTERSON
			(delighted)
		Might be exciting for you.

				STARLING
		I've never been all that adventurous.
		I wouldn't be in the way?

				PATTERSON
		I'd love the company. And I've hunted
		all my life.

				STARLING
			(gathering courage)
		Well, why not? You seem so calm and
		experienced.
			(standing, teacup in hand)
		Why not, indeed!
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

A SLIGHTLY WOUNDED DONKEY

It's roped loosely to a tree, bells around its neck. When it 
moves, they make a sound. Middle of the night. A night wind.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

We're in a clearing with thick trees all around.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND STARLING, seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge 
of the clearing, twelve feet up in the air. Patterson has his 
rifle ready. This next is all whispered.

				STARLING
			(embarrassed)
		I hate to be a bother, John, but the
		cramp's getting worse.
			(Pulls up his trousers-
			his leg is knotted)
		The pain is actually quite unbearable
		now.

				PATTERSON
		Shhh.

				STARLING
		I'm sure you mean that to be comforting,
		but-

				PATTERSON
			(interrupting)
		-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.

				STARLING
		That is precisely my plan- but back in
		my tent.
			(And he begins to climb down)

CUT TO

PATTERSON, grabbing him.

				PATTERSON
		They own the night- nobody moves when
		there's a man-eater out there.

Starling glumly obeys. Then-

				STARLING
		John? I know this isn't the time to ask,
		but-

				PATTERSON
		What?

				STARLING
		Since you'd only been here three hours
		when we met, are you sure this is how
		you hunt lions?

				PATTERSON
		Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse
		than you think- I've never even seen one.

CUT TO

STARLING, not pleased with this news. He massages his calf, tries 
to get comfortable, which is impossible. Patterson just stares at 
the night.

CUT TO

JUST BEFORE DAWN

The donkey dozes. So does Starling. Patterson has not so much as 
moved.

Now the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little.

And the donkey is suddenly awake and scared-

-and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears 
from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound 
EXPLODES-

-and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked 
but unhurt-

-he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it.

				STARLING
			(amazed)
		...one shot...

				PATTERSON
			(even more amazed)
		So that's what a lion looks like.
			(Now from the tree-)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL TENT AREA - JUST AFTER DAWN

HOLD for a moment.

				SAMUEL (over)
		One shot- one-

KEEP HOLDING

Now Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited-

-it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile.

				SAMUEL
		Patterson has made the nights safe
		again.

KEEP HOLDING FOR JUST A MOMENT MORE.

As he walks on, behind him come THREE COOLIES carrying the body of 
the lion. As dozens of men come running in from all over to see 
the dead man-eater-

				SAMUEL
			(mimes shooting)
		BOOM!
			(Now as the crowd
			continues to grow-)

CUT TO

A ROUGH ENGINEER'S DRAWING OF WHAT WILL BE THE BRIDGE

It has two embankments on either side of the river.

These embankments are big- forty feet wide, fifty feet high.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING standing on the high ground where the 
embankment will start. From here, there is a slope down to the 
river itself.

Also present is UNGAN SIGNH, who we saw earlier standing 
precariously atop the water tower. Singh, enormously powerful, is 
another assistant. Bright, a great worker, another main character 
in what is to follow.

Now Patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river- 
it's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother 
him. He talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who 
move down with him.

Singh, for all his massive size, moves like a cat. Starling does 
not, slipping and sliding.

				PATTERSON
			(gesturing)
		All right, I'd like to start the
		embankments today-
			(to Singh)
		-sufficient supplies on hand?

				SINGH
			(nods)
		More than.

				STARLING
		With much more on the way-
			(loses balance, falls)
		-John- we could have had this chat on
		flatter ground-

				PATTERSON
		-true enough- but without the comedy
		relief.
			(Starling, amazingly good
			natured, smiles, gets
			back up)

CUT TO

THE RIVER as they scramble down to it.

CUT TO

THE SLOPE they've come down- it's a long way back to the top.

CUT TO

THE THREE MEN. It's a glorious morning.

				PATTERSON
		How lucky we are.

				STARLING
		Aren't we full of ourselves today?
			(beat)
		I think it's because of the lion.

				PATTERSON
		Possibly.

				SINGH
			(soft)
		You know, I too have killed a lion.

				STARLING
		How many shots did you need?

CUT TO

SINGH. Almost embarrassed.

				SINGH
		I used my hands.

He holds his big hands up, palms out. Starling looks at Singh to 
see if he means it-

-he means it all right. Now, from Starling's perpetually surprised 
face-

CUT TO

SURVEYING EQUIPMENT

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON sighting through it- we are on the far side of the river 
now. Singh is there, Starling, too.

Behind them: a field of tall grass.

				PATTERSON
		All right- thee second embankment
		will go there.
			(He gestures toward
			the river)

				STARLING
		You do plan to mark it a bit more
		precisely than just-
			(imitating Patterson)
		-"there."

				PATTERSON
			(smiling)
		In your honor, Nigel. And you and
		Singh will be in charge of building
		them- and you'll also build the
		roadbeds and the three foundation
		pillars- and you'll be finished in
		eight thrilling weeks.

				STARLING
			(very dubious)
		John, it will not be easy.

				PATTERSON
		Nigel, you'll just have to use your
		hands-
			(And he smiles, repeating
			Singh's gesture, both 
			palms out)

CUT TO

SINGH. He smiles back, starts to reply. But his words stop, his 
smile dies. He just stares and we-

CUT TO

WHAT HE'S STARING AT- the surrounding field of tall grass. Nothing 
unusual about it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He stares, too.

CUT TO

THE FIELD OF TALL GRASS- suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a 
fresh wind.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Silent. As before. Starling follows his glance.

CUT TO

SINGH. Frozen.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. And now the field is making odd patterns- as if 
something unseen were moving through.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Quiet. Just the wind.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. Nothing visible. But the odd pattern seems to be making 
its way across the field.

CUT TO

SINGH AND STARLING. Quiet. Just the wind.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. The odd pattern seems to stop. Around it, the wind 
makes different shapes of the grass.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at 
the spot where the pattern stopped.

CUT TO

SINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to 
shiver, as if from cold.

CUT TO

THE BUILDING SEQUENCE

And what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity.

Huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and 
driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments.

And Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as 
the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in 
the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there.

And alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with 
glasses and very bright eyes.

Meanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that 
is on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to 
help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the 
clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with 
it, does well.

And Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but 
mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the 
placements of the three stone foundation pillars-

-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- 
and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the 
start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor-

-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes-

-which is all he wears from now on.

And the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, 
working with the power of three-

-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and 
Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded-

-it's hard, brutal work-

-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge 
skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work 
on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three 
foundation pillars are taking shape-

CUT TO

TONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to 
complete the embankments. As this goes on-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is 
going very quickly.

Patterson stops working, looks across the river-

-movement in the grassy area on the far side.

CUT TO

SEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to 
Samuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little 
men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL watching them.

				PATTERSON
		What are they looking at?

				SAMUEL
		You- they cannot believe you're
		still here.

				PATTERSON
		Nonsense.

				SAMUEL
		You don't know what Tsavo means, do
		you?
			(Patterson doesn't)
		It means "slaughter"...

CUT TO

THE NANDI TRIBESMEN, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads.

CUT TO

THE TWO EMBANKMENTS, as more and more red rock is shoved and 
pushed into shape.

CUT TO

THE THREE FOUNDATION PILLARS- almost finished.

CUT TO

THE ROADBED. The same.

CUT TO

THE NEAR EMBANKMENT as still more rock is forced in and

CUT TO

THE FAR EMBANKMENT done at last-

CUT TO

-and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the 
river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other.

And they all look at each other- the embankments are both 
finished- THE THREE OF THEM are flying-

-and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, 
in Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password.

HOLD. A big moment for them all!

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT AREA

He sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate 
is beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat.

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA

Starling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too.

CUT TO

SINGH, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep.

CUT TO

STARLING is in his tent, turning out his lamp, half asleep 
already.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in his tent, closing his eyes.

CUT TO

SINGH, deep asleep in his tent-

-he shares it with a dozen others and they're all deep asleep. 
They lie on the floor of the tent, heads together toward the 
center pole, feet toward the edges of the tent.

HOLD ON SINGH. It's very dark. HE AND HIS MEN just lie motionless, 
breathing deeply.

KEEP HOLDING.

Now the CAMERA moves up, high into the center of the tent, looking 
down at the circle of men.

KEEP HOLDING.

They don't move, not even an inch. The steady breathing is the 
only sound.

YES, KEEP HOLDING.

KEEP HOLDING.

Nothing is going on down there. Nothing at all.

KEEP HOLDING.

Not a goddamn thing.

KEEP ON HOLDING. KEEP ON HOLDING.

And now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide-

-and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by 
some giant invisible wire-

CUT TO

SINGH. CLOSE UP. Screaming.

CUT TO

THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT, waking, staring around and

CUT TO

SINGH as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams 
grow even louder as we

CUT TO

THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT and it's like a bomb just went off, they 
rise, spin, cry out, stare-

CUT TO

THE NIGHT OUTSIDE AND SINGH'S BODY sliding along the ground. It's 
pitch black, and he's going head first now, face upwards and he's 
going ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is that's 
making this happen is something we can't make out- because it's so 
dark and because it's on the far side of the man, and his body is 
in our way and

CUT TO

UP AHEAD, some bushes and

CUT TO

SINGH, his body going faster than before and his cries are 
weakening-

-CUT TO

THE NIGHT and his body and there is no sound at all coming from 
him now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making 
this happen- all we see, barely, is the limp body of the big man 
as it skims along and-

CUT TO

UP AHEAD NOW, a low clump of bushes.

CUT TO

SINGH'S BODY, coming closer and

CUT TO

THE BUSHES and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn 
bushes and now-

CUT TO

SINGH, suddenly rising magically in the night, his body flying 
over the bushes and gone!

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, early morning, their rifles held in front 
of them, racing along, suddenly stopping, staring down and

CUT TO

THE GROUND. At first we can't make out much. Then we can- a spot 
of red.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, hurrying on again.

CUT TO

THORN TREES, and as they force their way through them-

CUT TO

A LARGE VULTURE, wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth-

-HOLD-

-as it lands we can see A DOZEN OTHER VULTURES are already there, 
surrounding something-

-but we can't make it out. We are in an area of grass and shadow-

-and specks of blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, cries out in shock and fury, fires his rifle, races 
forward.

CUT TO

THE VULTURES screeching and screaming, taking off, and as we watch 
them soar into the morning sky-

				HAWTHORNE'S VOICE (over)
		What the lion must have done, once 
		he'd killed Singh, was lick his skin 
		off so he could drink his blood-

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

Hawthorne is examining Singh's body, trying to be professional, 
but he's clearly upset- it's awful.

				HAWTHORNE
		-then he feasted on him, starting
		with his feet-

				STARLING
			(evenb more upset)
		-please- you needn't be so graphic-

				HAWTHORNE
		You intend "sorting this out" tonight?

				PATTERSON
		I'll try- but this feels so different-
		that old lion I killed could never
		carry off a man Singh's size.

				STARLING
			(maybe a little alarmed)
		But you said they were always old.

				PATTERSON
		That's what the books say...
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

FLAMES RISING IN THE DARKENING SKY. NOW-

CUT TO

ABDULLAH in tears. Where are we?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

This is Singh's funeral pyre.

Singh's body is being burned.

A LOT OF INDIANS are there. We've caught sight of some of them 
before- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him 
in his tent.

There is a terrible sense of shock.

Patterson stands at the rear. He is terribly moved. Now, unseen by 
the others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final 
time.

CUT TO

THE FLAMES; they continue to rise...

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT

Night. The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut 
and tied.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, the middle of the night. He is alone, fifteen feet up 
in a tree near Singh's tent. He holds his rifle, ready for 
anything. He cannot get comfortable.

CUT TO

THE AREA- nothing, no movement.

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT. As before.

CUT TO

THE AREA. No sign of movement of any kind. Dead.

CUT TO

THE MOON. Lower in the sky. The night is growing to a lose but 
there is still darkness.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his 
eyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do-

CUT TO

TWO HUGE YELLOW EYES. That's all we see, just the eyes and they 
are near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down 
and-

CUT TO

THE HUGE YELLOW EYES- only they're gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky.

CUT TO

THE SUN, RISING, THE NIGHT DONE.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back 
toward his tent area. Now he stops.

CUT TO

ABDULLAH and a large group of workers- only they're not working. 
They smoke, play cards, sit around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, steaming, going up to Abdullah.

				PATTERSON
		You were contracted to work-

				ABDULLAH
			(gesturing around)
		-malaria epidemic; very sudden.

				PATTERSON
		Let me see the sick.

				ABDULLAH
			(not backing off)
		Oh, you're a doctor now, too?

				PATTERSON
		There is no reason for fear.

				ABDULLAH
		On that I choose to remain dubious.
			(beat)
		Two are dead now in two nights.
			(And on that news-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Rocked. He didn't know. Behind him now, Starling 
hurries up, Samuel alongside.

				PATTERSON
			(to Starling)
		Second death? Where?-

				STARLING
			(gesturing)
		-far end of camp- man wandering alone
		at night. Hawthorne's examining the
		body now.
			(beat)
		There's even less of him than of Singh.

				PATTERSON
			(just shakes his head)
		But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be
		that hungry this soon.
			(getting control- he
			looks to Samuel)
		Samuel?

				SAMUEL
		We should construct thorn fences 
		around every tent area. Fires burning 
		at night.

				PATTERSON
		Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew-
		no one allowed out at night.
			(to Abdullah)
		Send half your men to the bridge, the
		rest with these two.
			(Abdullah nods)
		And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But 
		I repeat- there is no reason for fear. 
		I will kill the lion and I will build 
		the bridge.

				ABDULLAH
		Of course you will, you are white, you
		can do anything...
			(They look at each 
			other. They are not 
			friends. Now-)

CUT TO

THE THORN BUSHES WE SAW ON OUR ARRIVAL TO TSAVO

ENDLESS NUMBERS OF THEM. There is a machete-like sound as we

CUT TO

A BUNCH OF WORKMEN, led by Samuel, chopping down branches. They do 
it with care- these are claws-

CUT TO

-STARLING, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, 
he's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his 
machete, moving in between bushes and

CUT TO

ONE OF THE BUSHES, SNAPPING BACK into Starling, and Starling 
taking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing-

-his arms are starting to bleed-

-he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at 
them, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and 
right now, he is possessed.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward 
the bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY AREA

For a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we 
saw with Singh. Something is making the grass move-

-only now there is no wind... HOLD.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Did he see it? We'll never know.

CUT TO

STARLING, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His 
clothes are shredded. A WORKER has finished with a section and 
satisfied, moves on-

-but Starling is far from finished. He grabs the thorns with his 
bare hands and squeezes them together.

				STARLING
		Not good enough- look, it's got to
		be tighter. Tighter.

CUT TO

THE AREA IN WHICH HE'S BEEN WORKING. FENCES ARE WELL ALONG TOWARD 
COMPLETION. IT'S LATE AFTERNOON.

PULL UP

We see more fences around more camp areas.

KEEP PULLING UP

The entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual 
areas protected.

The skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast.

Fires start up. Dozens of them.

Still darker.

Now workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety 
before darkness takes over. They zig-zag this way, that way, 
dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, 
get up, run on-

CUT TO

THE SUN. Falling out of the sky.

CUT TO

THE CAMP. The fires rise higher. No one moves... HOLD.

CUT TO

STARLING in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. 
Samuel is with him. Both are exhausted.

Patterson brings them each drinks. They nod thanks, drain them. 
They stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire. You 
get the sense these three will be friends forever.

				STARLING
		What a good week.

				PATTERSON
		You mean nobody died?

				STARLING
			(shakes his head)
		We all worked together. Worthy deeds
		were accomplished. I liked the labor.
			(beat)
		My mother insisted on piano lessons-
		broke the dear woman's heart when I
		turned out to be tone deaf- but she
		still was always at me about being
		careful with my hands.
			(looks at them)
		I like the blood, is that strange?

				SAMUEL
		Oh yes, I think so.
			(Starling smiles, starts
			to speak)

				PATTERSON
		Look out, Samuel, here it comes.

				STARLING
		Even you two must admit that it is a
		glorious thing, what Man can
		accomplish. When there is a common
		splendid goal, there are no limits.
		Think what we will accomplish when we
		all have God's warmth in our hearts.
			(Samuel's eyes have 
			closed; he begins to snore. 
			Patterson can't help
			laughing)

CUT TO

STARLING. As good natured as ever.

				STARLING
		I am immune to your disdain.
			(He looks at them now)
		When I came here, I had but one small
		goal: to convert the entire continent
		of Africa.
			(shakes his head)
		Now I've decided to move on to
		something really difficult: I will not
		rest until both of you are safely in
		the fold.

				SAMUEL
		I've had four wives, good luck.

				STARLING
		The struggle is the glory...
			(HOLD ON the three friends)

CUT TO

PATTERSON, the next morning, working with Abdullah and some others 
at the bridge.

CUT TO

STARLING completing work on the fence from the day before. It's 
high and taut and he's done a terrific job.

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION

A BUNCH OF OTHER MEN are working near a large grassy field. One of 
the men starts a chant. The others pick it up. It's really pretty.

CUT TO

PATTERSON wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the 
chant comes distantly to him on the wind.

CUT TO

THE WORKMEN CHANTING LOUDER. It's turning into a stunner of a day- 
glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds.

CUT TO

STARLING. Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men.

CUT TO

THE MEN WORKING AND SINGING. As before.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY FIELD. As before-

-except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something 
flicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone 
too quickly.

CUT TO

THE MEN WORKING, SINGING ON.

CUT TO

PATTERSON waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the 
men, of the birds. The sun is higher in the sky.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY FIELD-

-and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking 
back in another 180 degree arc-

-still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a 
tail. Now quickly-

CUT TO

PATTERSON wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view. He 
holds an envelope.

				SAMUEL
		For you.

				PATTERSON
			(taking it)
		Thank you, Samuel.

				SAMUEL
			(watching as Patterson
			opens it)
		Good news?

				PATTERSON
			(glancing at the letter)
		I expect so- it's from my wife.

				SAMUEL
		Do you love her?

				PATTERSON
		I do, actually; very much.

				SAMUEL
			(his wonderful smile)
		You give me hope, John.
			(As he walks away-)

CUT TO

STARLING, probing at the thorn fence, searching out any last 
weaknesses.

Behind him now, in the tall grass, something moves.

Starling, intent on his work, notices nothing.

CUT TO

THE SINGING MEN, getting more and more into it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, by the river, reading the letter.

There is a large tree up the riverbank. It casts a large shadow.

In the shadow now, something moves.

Patterson, intent on his reading, notices nothing.

				HELENA (over)
		Darling one- the big excitement
		yesterday was when some school-
		children spotted a whale-
			(pause)
		-they were looking at me, John-

CUT TO

HELENA, in their bedroom, moving across to the window, staring 
out. She now has a considerable stomach.

				HELENA
		That was an attempt at humor but I
		don't feel very funny these days. I
		miss you terribly and after our son-
		I still have total confidence- well,
		after he's born I think travel might
		be broadening. As he kicks me at
		night I'm quite sure he's telling me
		he definitely wants to come to Africa.
			(pause)
		Thought you might need reminding.

CUT TO

PATTERSON by the river. He smiles, folds the letter. Now-

CUT TO

THE SINGING WORKMEN at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they 
sound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound 
even better-

-there must be twenty of them, working and singing-

-and screaming!

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning his head sharply and

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same and

CUT TO

THE SCREAMING WORKMEN and they're running now, running and 
shrieking and that's all we see, the workmen-

-some of them run left-

-some run right-

-and now a few of them are starting to cry.

CUT TO

A FAT COOLIE running and running, glancing back, screaming louder, 
running on and on and

CUT TO

-a shadow in the grass- no telling what- but it's big and it's 
moving and

CUT TO

THE FAT COOLIE and this next goes so fast it could be a dream- or, 
more accurately, a nightmare-

SHOCK CUT TO

A GIGANTIC WHITE MANED LION as it leaps onto the Fat Coolie, 
brings him to earth, bites his neck in two, kills him, just-like-
that.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, as they race away from the river and

CUT TO

STARLING, running from the fenced area- he holds a rifle in his 
hands.

CUT TO

ANOTER PART OF THE CAMP AND A DIFFERENT BUNCH OF WORKMEN- they 
freeze as the screams reach them and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, on the way to his tent area and

CUT TO

DIFFERENT WORKMEN listening in fear and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, racing to his tent, grabbing his rifle and cartridges 
and

CUT TO

STARLING, running toward the screaming and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he charges ahead, loading his rifle on the fly and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, carrying more ammunition, running behind Patterson, 
keeping up and

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION and nothing is visible now- the men are gone and 
from this angle, it looks deserted and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, catching Starling, leading him into the TSAVO STATION 
area, Samuel just behind them.

CUT TO

A RECTANGULAR SHED, ahead of them. They move to it, slow-

-then they stop-

-a sound is heard- from around the corner- the sound continues- 
Patterson glances at Starling- the sound could be this: the 
crunching of bones.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, checking his rifle.

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same. Samuel, holding the extra ammunition, 
moves close to Patterson. Now-

CUT TO

PATTERSON as he suddenly steps away from the shed, rounding the 
corner and as he does-

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, with the Fat Coolie- the lion is crunching at his 
feet-

-then the lion stares toward the shed as we

CUT TO

PATTERSON, moving out into clearer view, Starling and Samuel right 
with him. THE LION is a good distance away.

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, a low growl coming from him as he takes the 
coolie's body by the shoulder, begins backing away with it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, dropping to his knees for the shot and

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same and

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, growling louder and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, taking aim and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow 
motion-

-Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and-

-and this thing is suddenly there-

-this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the 
flat roof of the shed and

CUT TO

THE SUN, blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully 
stretched, it seems to go on forever and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning around to see and

CUT TO

STARLING, turning too, and we're coming back into regular motion 
now as we

CUT TO

This enormous BLACK-MANED LION diving into the three, sending them 
all sprawling and

CUT TO

THE WHITE MANED LION roaring and

CUT TO

THE BLACK MANED LION roaring, running to the other and

CUT TO

THE TWO LIONS IN CLOSE UP.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, for that is how they will be referred 
to-

-and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth-

-The Darkness has eyes that are crazed-

-they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old 
and the young and the fat and the strong-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to 
reach for his rifle and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, the white and the black, as they move 
toward the field of tall grass, roaring and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S RIFLE and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring 
sounds are deafening now and

CUT TO

THE TWO GIGANTIC MALES, backing into the tall grass-

-they roar one final time-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we

CUT TO

THE TALL GRASS and they're gone, the grass is full of moving 
patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing 
this way, that way-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, staggering to his feet, staring at the grassy field.

				PATTERSON
			(dazed)
		Jesus, two of them...

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and

CUT TO

STARLING, LYING DEAD, his throat ripped open. HOLD briefly on the 
young man, then-

CUT TO

THE STATION AREA

A train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly 
chaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of 
the busier parts in camp-

-but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with 
several dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting 
for the train.

Patterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah 
and Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them 
walking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same.

				PATTERSON
			(shouting over the noise
			of the approaching train)
		-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-
			(gesturing toward the men
			who stand by the train
			tracks)
		-there's nothing wrong with your men
		so stop telling me there is-

				ABDULLAH
			(advancing on Patterson now)
		-you do not call me a liar- you know
		nothing of their health- consider
		yourself fortunate I persuaded so 
		many to stay- consider yourself 
		fortunate I have decided to stay-

				PATTERSON
			(losing it)
		You think you matter?
			(gesturing toward the
			train which is close to
			stopping now)
		-Beaumont is on that train- he 
		matters-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, moving in on Abdullah now-

				PATTERSON
		He sees this chaos, he'll replace 
		you all.

				ABDULLAH
		He'll replace you, too- that's all 
		you really care about.

				PATTERSON
		You think so? Fine.
			(finished arguing)
		It's best you get out. Go. Tell all 
		your people to go, run home where 
		they'll be safe under the covers and 
		when the bridge is built and the
		railroad is done, they can tell their
		women that out of all the thousands
		who worked here, they were the only
		ones to flee-
			(And he wheels around,
			starts to walk away as we-)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH. Quiet, staring after Patterson.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Patterson has won. As the two of them exchange a quick 
glance-

CUT TO

BEAUMONT standing in the door of a passenger car, handsome as 
ever. Somehow his clothes are still pressed.

Patterson moves up. In a splendid mood. Samuel is happy too.

				PATTERSON
		Pleasant journey?

				BEAUMONT
			(stepping off the train)
		How could it be? I hate Africa.

Now there is the sudden sound of men singing- Patterson looks 
around and we

CUT TO

ABDULLAH and his workmen, moving away from the train- they are 
singing the same song that the workmen sang just before The Ghost 
and The Darkness attacked- it's pretty- but it's also a little 
unnerving.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Listening a moment.

				BEAUMONT
		Lovely sound- they seem happy.

				PATTERSON
		Don't they, though?

				BEAUMONT
		So work must be going well?

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He and Samuel share another glance.

				PATTERSON
			(delicately)
		Truthfully?
			(beat)
		There has been the occasional odd
		hiccup- but then, as you so wisely
		told me, I'd never built in Africa.

				BEAUMONT
		But overall, you're pleased?

				SAMUEL
			(moving in)
		I have never experienced anything
		like it.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT; almost longingly looks back at the train.

				BEAUMONT
		I almost feel like getting right
		back on.
			(glances at his watch)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. They do not breathe.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. He really wants to leave and for a moment it looks like 
he just might.

				BEAUMONT
			(a sigh)
		I suppose it would be a dereliction
		of duty not to at least look around.

Now Abdullah wanders happily by.

				PATTERSON
			(waving)
		Morning, friend, glorious day.

				ABDULLAH
		As are they all.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. He takes a step inside the passenger car.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. Hoping.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Reluctantly returning. He has a large box.

				BEAUMONT
		I do need to see Starling.

				PATTERSON
			(dully)
		Starling?

				BEAUMONT
		Awhile back he ordered some bibles-
			(indicating the box)
		-I've brought them.
			(looking around)
		Is he here?

				PATTERSON
			(beat)
		Yes he is.

				BEAUMONT
		Well, I need to speak to him.

				SAMUEL
			(helpfully)
		Let me deliver the bibles.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. His eyes flick from one man to the other. It's over.

				BEAUMONT
		Excellent show.
			(voice low)
		Where is Starling?

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The jig is up. He gestures-

				PATTERSON
		Here he comes now.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

HALF A DOZEN NATIVES CARRYING STARLING'S COFFIN. They start to put 
it on the train and as they do-

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Stunned. And furious! He storms off the train and we-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE

as Beaumont sees it. Patterson and Samuel are with him.

Little more work has been done than the last time we saw it. A few 
men are working slowly.

And now there are guards with rifles patrolling it.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. A deadly look at them. He storms off.

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

as Beaumont sees it- Patterson, Samuel, and Hawthorne stand 
quietly.

It's much more crowded than the last time. Still under control, 
but barely.

Beaumont is icy now. He gestures sharply toward Hawthrone to join 
them.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL

THE FOUR MEN speak low and fast-

				BEAUMONT
		What in hell is going on?

				SAMUEL
		The Ghost and The Darkness have come.

				BEAUMONT
			(snapping)
		In English.

				PATTERSON
		It's what the natives are calling 
		the lions-
			(beat)
		-two lions have been causing trouble-

				BEAUMONT
		-what's the surprise in that, this is
		Africa?

				PATTERSON
		It hasn't been that simple so far.

				BEAUMONT
		What have they done besides kill
		Starling?
			(beat)
		How many have they killed?
			(Patterson nods for
			Hawthorne to answer)

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. Doing his best.

				HAWTHORNE
		Well, of course, I can't supply a
		totally accurate answer because
		there are those that are actually
		authenticated and there are those
		that we once thought were workers
		killing each other or deserting
		from camp so any number I give is
		subject to error-

				BEAUMONT
			(cutting through)
		How many?

				HAWTHORNE
		Thirty, I should think.

				BEAUMONT
			(stunned)
		Christ!
			(whirling on Patterson)
		What are you doing about it?
			(Now from there-)

CUT TO

SOMETHING VERY ODD:

We are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area. This is 
not near the track but off by itself, in an area surrounded by 
thorn trees.

Several workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it, trying to 
disguise the fact that the small railroad car is, indeed, nothing 
but a small railroad car.

It is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND BEAUMONT looking at it.

				BEAUMONT
		This is supposed to be salvation?
			(staring at Patterson)
		What kind of idiocy are we dealing
		with here?

				PATTERSON
			(keeping control)
		I'm calling it my "contraption"-
		we're going to surround it with a
		boma- a fence, to you- and we're
		going to leave a small opening
		opposite that door.

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD CAR. There is, in fact, an open front door. Patterson 
gestures for Beaumont to follow him inside.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE CAR AS THEY ENTER. It has been divided in half by thick 
metal bars from floor to ceiling. The bars are close together, 
only a few inches between them.

				PATTERSON
		In that half will be bait- human
		bait- I'll start things off-
			(points to the open
			doorway)
		-a sliding door will fit above that
		and a trip wire will run across
		the floor.

				BEAUMONT
			(The smile is back)
		Genius- the beast will enter,
		tripping the wire, the door will
		slide down, trapping him, you, safe
		behind the bars, will have him at
		your mercy and will shoot him.

Patterson nods. Beaumont explodes.

				BEAUMONT
		Are you running a high fever, man?
		How could you expect something as
		lunatic as this to succeed? How
		could you even conceive of it?

				PATTERSON
		I didn't conceive of it for the
		lions- I built one in India when
		there was trouble with a tiger.

				BEAUMONT
			(incredulous)
		And it worked?

				PATTERSON
			(He hates to say this)
		In point of fact, it didn't.
			(hurrying on)
		But I'm convinced the theory is
		sound.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM. They move outside. The tension between them is 
considerable. Beaumont looks at Patterson for too long a moment.

				PATTERSON
		What?

				BEAUMONT
		I made a mistake hiring you- 
		you're simply not up to the job.
			(Silence. Then-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP.

				PATTERSON
		You genuinely enjoy trying to	
		terrify people, don't you? Well, 
		fine-
			(lashing back)
		-except there isn't a higher rated
		engineer and we both know that. And
		since time is so important to you,
		how long do you think it would take 
		to find someone else qualified and 
		bring him here?

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Blazing.

				BEAUMONT
		Let me explain about time- you've 
		been here three months and already 
		two months behind. And the Germans 
		and the French are gearing up. And 
		I don't care about you and I don't 
		care about the thirty dead- I care 
		about my knighthood and if this 
		railroad finishes on schedule, I'll 
		get my knighthood and I want it.
			(glancing around as
			Samuel appears, goes to
			the workers)
		Professional hunters may be the answer.

				PATTERSON
		All they'll bring is more chaos and
		we've plenty of that already- and if
		they come in, word will get out- and
		what happens to your knighthood then?

				BEAUMONT
		I'm going to try and locate Redbeard-
		I assume you've heard of him.

				PATTERSON
		Every man who's ever fired a rifle has 
		heard of him- by the time you find him,
		the lions will be dead.

				BEAUMONT
			(long pause)
		Very well, the job's still yours, I'll 
		go. But if I have to return, you're
		finished. And I will then do everything
		I can to destroy your reputation. Am I
		not fair?
			(The great smile flashes)
		Told you you'd hate me.
			(And he turns, walks off)

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Moving up to Patterson. Samuel has a bag.

				PATTERSON
			(staring after Beaumont)
		I do hate him.
			(takes the bag from
			Samuel, pulls out flares)
		I want you to distribute one bag of
		flares to every tent area-
			(takes out a flare)
		-tell the men to light them if
		there's trouble-
			(beat)
		-make it two bags.
			(HOLD briefly, then-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. ALONE. THAT NIGHT. IN HIS CONTRAPTION.

A lamp burns alongside him. Across the bars, the door of the 
railroad car is open. Flickering shadows. Above the doorway is a 
thick wooden slab the size of the door. n the ground, barely 
visible, the trip wire.

CUT TO

THE DOORWAY. Outside, something is moving.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, rifle ready, holding his breath.

CUT TO

THE DOORWAY. SIlence. Nothing moves now.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He rubs his eyes with his hands...

CUT TO

FLICKERING SHADOWS on the wall. It's later that night.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The man is bleary with fatigue. He sits in a corner of 
the car, writing a letter.

				PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)
		"Dearest...
		...peace and tranquility continue to
		abound here- the workers report each
		day with a smile- except for your
		absence, this whole adventunre is
		providing me nothing but pleasure..."

CUT TO

THE FLICKERING WALLS OF THE RAILWAY CAR. It's later still. 
Patterson, finished writing, stares out at the night.

CUT TO

A FLARE, rising brightly toward the sky.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, seeing the flare. The man is miserable.

CUT TO

A TREE BRANCH. MANY FLOWERS AS WELL AS THE CLAW THORNS.

				PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)
		Fire.

The branch is destroyed, the flowers blown away.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THREE INDIAN COOLIES. NOT FAR FROM HIS CONTRAPTION.

THE COOLIES hold rifles. They look like brothers, which they are. 
They also look tough. And they are that, too. THREE 
STREETFIGHTERS.

				PATTERSON
			(impressed)
		Very good indeed.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
			(he wears glasses)
		We have hunted since childhood.

				PATTERSON
		All right- you'll spend your nights
		inside.
			(He indicates the railroad
			car. The Coolies nod)
		You'll have plenty of ammunition.
		You're totally protected, you have
		really nothing to fear.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		That is correct.
			(beat)
		Nothing.

Patterson looks at the three men. Obviously, he could not have 
chosen better. From them-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. DAY.

A lot of men working under Patterson. Progress is slow.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. NIGHT.

Some men sit on the part that's been built. Spending the night 
there for protection. Now, they all turn and we

CUT TO

ANOTHER FLARE going off in another part of camp.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, in a tree alone, in despair.

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES IN THE RAILROAD CAR.

Tough as ever. Ready for anything. But nothing is happening. 
Silence.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE AGAIN AS NIGHT FALLS - MORE CROWDED THAN BEFORE.

STILL MORE MEN are moving into the river. They wade til the water 
is up to their necks. Then they reach out, hold hands, start to 
sing.

CUT TO

PATTERSON moving high into a tree. He listens to the sound. 
Lovely.

CUT TO

MOONLIGHT ON THE WATER. The men stand as before, singing softly. 
The river here is calm, no current to speak of. The men are safe-

-or rather they should be.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling 
the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as 
the others start to scream-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, watching another flare rise, helplessly listening.

CUT TO

A CATTLE PEN. THE CATTLE ARE NERVOUS-

-one of them kicks wildly at the wind.

They should be nervous-

-The Ghost walks among them, chooses which one to kill, leaps on 
it, brings it to earth as the dust rises.

CUT TO

ANOTHER FLARE IN THE NIGHT.

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL. DAY. PACKED.

HAWTHORNE seems overwhelmed.

CUT TO

SOMETHING.

And for a moment we don't know what it is. There is a faint light 
and now we see what it is we're looking at: a wire.

HOLD ON THE WIRE.

And now a paw walks across it-

-and the instant that happens-

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES, the brothers, in the contraption, two of them 
asleep, a flickering lamp the only illumination in the railroad 
car and

CUT TO

THE DOOR OF THE RAILROAD CAR slamming loudly down and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE DARKNESS, standing alone in one half of the railroad car- it's 
incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked 
and

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

The entire of the car- the thick bars separating the two halves. 
In one half, the huge lion. In the other, the three armed, tough 
coolies.

For a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too 
startled and surprised to do anything but stare-

-and then all hell just explodes as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the 
kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but 
this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more 
terrifying and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, throwing his huge body at the bars and

CUT TO

THE BARS and both his front claws are slashing through and

CUT TO

THE THREE TOUGH COOLIES and they retreat against the rear wall of 
the car.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, rage building, throwing its body at the bars again 
and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do 
anything but stare and

CUT TO

THE CLAWS, ripping at the air and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping forward, smashing into the bars and

CUT TO

THE CEILING WHERE THE BARS are connected and the sheer power of 
his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, staring up at the ceiling and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, AND HERE HE COMES AGAIN, roaring and his body hits 
the bars and

CUT TO

THE CEILING- and the bars shake-

-but they're not giving way.

CUT TO

THE TOUGH COOLIES, as they begin to realize this and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, clawing for them and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, raging and roaring on his side of the bars and

CUT TO

THE FIRST COOLIE, raising his gun and

CUT TO

THE SECOND COOLIE, his gun raised too and

CUT TO

THE THIRD COOLIE and he's ready and

CUT TO

ALL THREE AS THEY FIRE-

-and reload-

-and fire again, and reload, and-

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD CAR- and suddenly the lamp is knocked over-

-and a fire starts, flames grow and it's starting to look like 
hell in there-

-only it gets worse as we-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS at the bars-

-and suddenly it stands up- it seems to fill the car, towering 
over everything, it's like a nightmare come to kill you-

CUT TO

THE COOLIES staring up at this giant thing, and of course they're 
more terrified now than they've ever been in their lives- but 
these are tough men and they ignore the flames, ignore the 
deafening roars of the beast and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, standing there, going crazy on his side of the bars, 
trying to knock them down but they're holding and

CUT TO

THE TOUGH COOLIES, reloading and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, racing around the enclosed area now and he's trapped 
and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes 
have never been so bright, his roars as deafening and

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES, firing again and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping at the bars again, and they shake, sure they 
shake, but they keep on holding and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, firing, reloading, firing, reloading and as they do, 
something's starting to come clear-

-amazing as it may seem, impossible as it may be to conceive, 
they're missing.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, whirling on his side, roaring and leaping and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES and sure they fire, but they're still so goddam scared 
and

CUT TO

THE DOOR THAT SLID DOWN- it's held in place by some thick wooden 
bars-

-and now the Coolies start to hit something- the wooden bars 
because they begin to splinter and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, whirling, leaping at the bars and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES firing and then-

CUT TO

THE DOOR as it flops open and just like that-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS. Out the door and gone. HOLD.

CUT TO

PATTERSON JUST AFTER DAWN IN THE DAMAGED RAILROAD CAR.

Patterson stands where The Darkness was. The three Coolies are 
where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars.

This was the lowest point yet for Patterson. Not only had his 
notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend 
how the coolies missed. It never seemed possible- but of course, 
it really happened.

				PATTERSON
		Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		-I would never make excuses- but a
		fire broke out- the light was bad- he
		kept moving-

				PATTERSON
		-well, of course he kept moving- but
		he couldn't have been more than ten
		feet away from the three of you- surely
		you must have wounded the thing-

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		I assure you we came close many times-

Abdullah is in the doorway near Patterson now- with several dozen 
men. And from Abdullah's face, this is clearly going to be a 
confrontation.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		-the next time we will do better.
			(Patterson makes no
			reaction; moves outside)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH, simmering, moving straight to Patterson as soon as he's 
out.

				ABDULLAH
		The next time will be as this time-
		The Devil has come to Tsavo-

				PATTERSON
			(not in a mood for this)
		-that's ridiculous talk and you can't
		seriously believe it-

				ABDULLAH
			(moving in- tension rising
			as others crowd behind him)
		-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I
		don't think so-

CUT TO

THE BUSH just beyond- something is moving- an animal?- Impossible 
to say.

				PATTERSON
		I wasn't and you know it and don't
		push it- just listen- we have a
		problem in Tsavo-

				ABDULLAH
			(cutting in)
		-at last you're right- we do- you are
		the problem in Tsavo-

				PATTERSON
		-careful, Abdullah-

Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous.

				ABDULLAH
		You do not tell me "careful"- you do
		not tell me anything- you listen
		while I talk-
			(Now suddenly a shadow
			seems to cross-)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH. CLOSE UP. His eyes widen.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

AN ENORMOUS PISTOL. Pressed hard against Abdullah's temple.

				MAN'S VOICE (over)
		-change in plan- you listen while
		I talk- because you have a question
		that needs answering.
			(beat)
		Will I pull the trigger?

PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL

REDBEARD.

We are looking at one of those legends- ageless and powerful, with 
a tanned face and a thick grey beard. He has seen everything and 
is capable of anything.

Just now he seems more than capable of killing Abdullah. Very 
calmly, he cocks the pistol.

				SAMUEL (over)
		It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill
		you.

				REDBEARD
			(not looking around)
		No hints, Samuel.

				ABDULLAH
			(The name has registered)
		You don't know all that has happened
		here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.

				REDBEARD
		You're right. The Devil has come. Look
		at me. I am the Devil.

CUT TO

ABDULLAH, staring at Redbeard. Right now Redbeard just could be.

				ABDULLAH
			(louder)
		I am a man of peace.

				REDBEARD
		Am I to take it you want to live?

				ABDULLAH
		Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

				REDBEARD
		Excellent decision.
			(Now he suddenly reaches
			out, shakes Abdullah's hand)
		Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll
		meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid
		morning.

				ABDULLAH
			(dazed- leaving)
		I think it's been a pleasure.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, and now he does another surprising thing: embraces 
Samuel.

				REDBEARD
			(three words)
		You got old.
			(Now he releases Samuel,
			turns to Patterson)
		I'm sure you're John Patterson.
			(before Patterson can reply)
		Stay out of my way.
			(And without another word,
			he's gone)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

as Redbeard moves through, taking it all in. It's even worse than 
when we last saw it- bodies crammed everywhere and always the 
sound of pain and sickness.

Patterson stands in the doorway, watching, waiting.

				PATTERSON
			(as Redbeard approaches)
		I didn't have a chance to thank you.

				REDBEARD
			(preoccupied)
		What did I do?

				PATTERSON
		Got me out of trouble.

				REDBEARD
			(matter of fact)
		Nonsense- Samuel would have done
		something.
			(starts to move on)

				PATTERSON
		We need to talk.

				REDBEARD
		Let me save time- (1) you are the
		engineer; (2) you are in charge;
		(3) you're sorry I'm here. Right
		so far?
			(Patterson nods)
		Good- because (1) I am not an
		engineer, (2) I don't want to be
		in charge, and (3) I'm sorrier than
		you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo.
		So I will help you by killing the
		lions and leaving, and you will help
		me by doing what I tell you so I
		can leave. See any problems?

				PATTERSON
		Actually, no.

				REDBEARD
		All right- let's go into battle.
			(suddenly taking
			Patterson's hand)
		I'm Redbeard.
			(as they shake)

				PATTERSON
		Somehow I guessed.
			(As they move outside-)

CUT TO

THE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

A BUNCH OF MEN WAIT. Hwathorne, Samuel, Abdullah, and perhaps a 
dozen other worker leaders. Redbeard and Patterson move to them.

				REDBEARD
		Starting now, we attack them.

				ABDULLAH
		How; we don't know where they are?

				REDBEARD
		We'll have to make them come to us,
		won't we? And since there are two of
		them, we're going to set two plans
		in motion.
			(to Hawthorne)
		First: we must move the entire
		hospital by tomorrow night.

				HAWTHORNE
			(appalled)
		That's a terrible idea-

				REDBEARD
			(backtracking)
		-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of
		course, you're the doctor, you 
		should know.

				HAWTHORNE
		Silliest thing I ever heard of- why
		in the world should we go through
		all that?

				REDBEARD
			(charming now)
		I suppose I could answer you. I
		suppose I could explain that the 
		place is so inviting, what with the 
		smell of blood and flesh, that they 
		have to strike. It's even possible 
		that I tell you I found some fresh 
		paw marks around back which means 
		they're already contemplating 
		feasting here.
			(Turning on Hawthorne
			now- his voice building)
		But I don't want to answer you 
		because when you question me you are 
		really saying that I don't have the 
		least idea what I am doing, that I am 
		nothing but an incompetent, that I am 
		a fool.
			(big)
		Anyone who finds me a fool, please 
		say so now.

				HAWTHORNE
			(The words burst out)
		I have been desperate for Patterson 
		to let me move the hospital since the 
		day he arrived.

				REDBEARD
			(nice smile)
		Then we agree.
			(And on that-)

BEGIN THE BUILDING SEQUENCE.

It was a huge effort and they got half of it done that day- but 
there was always the sense of impending bloodshed.

What we see first are Patterson and a bunch of shots of a lot of 
workers- laying out the dimensions of the new boma that would 
surround the place. This was to be by far the biggest wall fence 
they had in Tsavo.

And now here comes Abdullah leading a crowd of men, wading into a 
huge patch of thorn trees, cutting the thick branches down, 
starting to load them for carrying-

-and it's high noon now, and Patterson drenched with sweat, leads 
the start of the actual building- taking the thorn branches, 
bunching them together, forcing them so there is no room between 
them-

-and we can just begin to get the sense of what the fence will be- 
except at the moment it's barely a foot high-

-and now Redbeard appears, beckons to Patterson, and

CUT TO

A LONG SHOT OF A FLAT GRASSY PLAIN. AFTERNOON NOW.

Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel walk quickly.

CUT TO

SAMUEL turning to Redbeard and Patterson.

				SAMUEL
		Soon.
			(Redbeard nods)

				PATTERSON
			(to Redbeard)
		I have to ask- why do you need me?

				REDBEARD
		I don't really. But understand
		something- even though it may take
		me two or three days to sort this
		out-
			(Patterson has to smile
			at the phrase)
		-when I'm gone, you'll still have
		to build the bridge. And I don't
		want the men to have lost respect
		for you.

				PATTERSON
			(kind of surprised)
		That's very considerate.

				REDBEARD
		I'm always considerate- my mother
		taught me that.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, who just breaks out laughing.

				REDBEARD
		Why do you laugh?- you don't
		believe she taught me?

				SAMUEL
		I don't believe you had a mother.
			(And as Redbeard
			laughs too-)

CUT TO

A MASAI VILLAGE as they approach. Redbeard walks ahead.

				PATTERSON
		You like him, don't you?

				SAMUEL
		Oh yes. But it takes time.

				PATTERSON
		You've known him long?

				SAMUEL
			(He has)
		Since his beard was red.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE VILLAGE. AN AGED CHIEF RUNS THINGS.

Redbeard, Patterson and Samuel stand near him. WOMEN and CHILDREN 
are there. Some of the children look at Redbeard, mime shooting, 
fall down dead. Samuel translates as necessary.

				SAMUEL
		How many cattle?

				REDBEARD
		Four should do it.

				SAMUEL
		They will want a lot of money.

				PATTERSON
			(to Redbeard)
		Have you got it?

				REDBEARD
		No, but you do-
			(beat)
		-see, you were needed after all.
			(to Samuel)
		And fifty warriors at the camp
		before dawn.

				SAMUEL
			(Samuel explains. The
			Masai Chief replies.
			Translating)
		Why so many?

				REDBEARD
		Because I have two plans to kill
		the lions- one involving the cattle,
		the other the men.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON watching as Samuel tells the Chief.

CUT TO

THE MASAI CHIEF. He moves toward Redbeard and Patterson. As he 
speaks, Samuel translates quietly. There is a sadness in the 
Chief's tone.

				SAMUEL
			(translating)
		The Ghost and the Darkness have
		come... and we can do nothing...
		but if you anger them... they will
		stay in Tsavo... and life will
		become more unberable, that I know...

CUT TO

PATTERSON, watching as Redbeard replies.

				REDBEARD
			(beat)
		Two lions are all that have come...
		they're only lions, that I know.
			(beat)
		And I will kill them both tomorrow.
			(HOLD BRIEFLY, then-)

CUT TO

SHADOWS AND FIRELIGHT. IT'S NIGHT NOW.

We're not sure for a moment where we are but we can hear metallic 
sounds.

Now we hear voices.

				REDBEARD VOICE (over)
		I'll need you by me in the morning.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Whatever you wish.

CUT TO

WHERE WE ARE- IT'S PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. Patterson, Redbeard, 
Hawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire.

THey are cleaning their guns, getting ready.

A WORD ABOUT THEIR WEAPONS. Patterson's is a good rifle and he 
cleans it expertly.

Redbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest. And the way his hands move 
as he assembles it, he might be bathing a child.

Hawthorne is the least skilled of the three. But his rifle is 
clearly the finest. Bigger than the others, with great killing 
power.

There is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel 
show it. Redbeard is as before.

				HAWTHORNE
			(terribly tense)
		You're certain about tomorrow?
			(Redbeard is)
		But you don't seem excited.
			(Redbeard isn't)

				PATTERSON
		You don't enjoy killing, do you?
			(Redbeard doesn't)

				HAWTHORNE
		Then why do it?

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. He stares at the fire. Then-

				REDBEARD
		I have a gift.

CUT TO

THE CAMPFIRE. Silence for a moment except for the sound of the 
weapons being reassembled. Redbeard's hands fly. His rifle is back 
together. He stands, nods, goes.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, watching him.

				HAWTHORNE
		Strange man.
			(to Samuel)
		Has he always been this way?

				SAMUEL
		Much gentler now.

				HAWTHORNE
			(shakes his head on that)
		John?-
			(He holds out his
			beautiful rifle)
		Change guns with me- mine's much
		more powerful. I'll be finishing
		the hospital tomorrow so I won't
		be with you- but if you'll use
		this...
			(beat)
		...then I will.

Patterson, touched, changes weapons.

				PATTERSON
		Thank you.
			(He turns to Samuel)
		Why does he need you by him?

				SAMUEL
		He doesn't. He needs nobody. But
		we have hunted many times...
			(beat)
		...he knows I am afraid of lions...

HOLD ON THE FIRELIGHT UNTIL WE SHARPLY-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. BEFORE DAWN.

Misty- hard to see much.

Then GHOSTS appear-

KEEP HOLDING

-they're not ghosts, they're MASAI WARRIORS emerging from the 
mists. They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking 
equipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them 
materialize-

CUT TO

A HUGE THICKET.

Redbeard, Patterson, and Samuel wait as the Warriors approach.

				REDBEARD
			(whispered)
		I spotted one of them-
			(gesturing toward
			the thicket)
		-in there.

CUT TO

THE THICKET again- alive with thorn trees. Dark, filled with long 
dark shadows.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. A lot of tension.

				REDBEARD
		The best way to ensure the kill
		when you're using trackers is for
		one to shoot while the other uses
		the trackers to force the lion
		toward the shooter. Have you ever
		led trackers?

				PATTERSON
			(He hasn't)
		I can try.

				REDBEARD
			(no good)
		Samuel says you killed a lion.

				PATTERSON
		It was probably luck- I'd rather
		you did the shooting.

				REDBEARD
		You'd never force the lion to me-
		and nobody ever got a lion with
		one shot by luck.
			(points- hand out
			straight)
		Around there's a clearing- you'll
		know it from the anthills- get
		there and hide and listen to the
		sounds- I'll make the lion come
		directly to you.
			(He gestures for
			Patterson to take
			off and as he does-)

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS as Redbeard goes to them-

				REDBEARD
			(as Samuel translates)
		-all of you- spread the width of
		the clearing- no gaps- go-
			(claps his hands once)

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, spreading apart.

CUT TO

THE SUN. Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, running like hell.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, moving quickly, silently.

CUT TO

A THICK CLUSTER 0F THORN TREES.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, ducking his head, blasting through.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, starting to cover the entire width of the thicket.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, quickstepping over rocky terrain.

CUT TO

SAMUEL staying close to Redbeard. The fear is there.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, studying the position of the Warriors, who are almost 
ready.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, circling now, racing toward a clearing, picking up 
speed.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, spread out. They look to Redbeard.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Not yet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, racing into the clearing, glances around- lots of 
anthills.

CUT TO

AN ANTHILL, eight feet high. It casts a long shadow.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Holding Hawthorne's marvelous rifle, he slips silently 
into the shadow.

HOLD ON PATTERSON- it's almost as if he weren't there.

CUT SHARPLY TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Suddenly screaming and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, screaming too and

CUT TO

THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, suddenly moving forward, all of them 
shouting and screaming and pounding on their drums and it is loud.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in the shadow. The noise is faint- but he can hear it.

CUT TO

A DOZEN DRUMMERS, moving forward, banging away.

CUT TO

A DOZEN MORE DRUMMERS, even louder.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, moving forward, his eyes flicking ahead-

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Just the least bit louder now.

CUT TO

THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, screaming and pounding and

CUT TO

SAMUEL- the fear worse, dogging Redbeard's steps.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. His eyes flicking ahead.

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. It's a lot louder now. He's totally still. And he's 
ready.

CUT TO

THE DENSEST PART OF THE THICKET we've seen yet.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, slashing their way through, drumming and shouting 
and

CUT TO

REDBEARD, at their head, eyes, as always, flicking.

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

REDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point-

-because something is there-

CUT BACK TO

THE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw 
it before-

-but now something begins to move and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and 
they're starting to move faster and

CUT TO

PATTERSON IN THE SHADOW.

The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more 
distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we

CUT TO

A FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to 
move away from the sound-

-and toward where Patterson is waiting.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and

CUT TO

SAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON- he fingers the weapon.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now 
instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and

CUT TO

REDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors 
to get left and

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The 
Ghost's intended path and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and

CUT TO

REDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift 
the other way and

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's 
path again and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in 
the original direction- toward Patterson and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass 
hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and 
sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but 
you couldn't tell that from what they're doing-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware 
of Patterson's existence behind him.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the 
sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, backing toward Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, starting to turn.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, ready to fire.

CUT TO

THE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And 
now its lips go back as it sees Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he 
squeezes the trigger-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull 
snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, unharmed and

CUT TO

PATTERSON desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function 
and

CUT TO

THE GHOST. It stares at Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE GHOST-

-and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau-

-THEN THE GHOST ROARS-

CUT TO

REDBEARD as he hears it, breaking into a wild run-

				REDBEARD
		Shoot for chrissakes!-

CUT TO

PATTERSON standing his ground as now THE GHOST takes a step toward 
him.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the 
clearing and as he reaches it-

CUT TO

THE GHOST. Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and

CUT TO

REDBEARD's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot 
at the animal- he curses, races for a better position and

CUT TO

THE GHOST. One final stare at Patterson-

-then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket-

-and it's safe and free and gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Rocked.

The low point of his life.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, catching up to Redbeard.

				SAMUEL
		Did you ever see a lion that size?

				REDBEARD
		Not even close.
			(Now he moves to
			Patterson)
		What happened?

				PATTERSON
			(a whisper)
		...misfire... it jammed...

				REDBEARD
		Has it ever done that before?

				PATTERSON
		...don't know...

				SAMUEL
		It's Hawthorne's.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Trying for control.

				REDBEARD
		You exchanged weapons?
			(Patterson nods)
		You went into battle with an
		untried gun?
			(Patterson nods)

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's 
going to do. It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to 
happen.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Drained, he epects it. It's very quiet.

CUT TO

REEDBEARD, studying the younger man. And when he finally speaks, 
his voice is surprisingly quiet.

				REDBEARD
		They have an expression in
		prizefighting: "everyone has a plan
		until they're hit."
			(beat)
		You've just been hit...
			(beat)
		...the getting up is up to you...
			(And he turns, moves
			off and)

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL.

Nearly finished. The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is 
supervising men and material that are being transferred.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, checking security in the New Hospital which is close to 
the center of camp. (The Old Hospital was situated on the 
outskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the 
sick and the wounded.) Late afternoon, now.

Patterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him. As are TWO 
EXPERIENCED ORDERLIES, both armed with powerful rifles. Patterson 
is silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his 
face.

				REDBEARD
			(to the Orderlies)
		Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell
		at all here, and little blood. When
		we leave, close the gate securely,
		don't open it til morning and keep
		your fires high. Any questions, ask
		them now.
			(They understand- now
			to Samuel and Hawthorne)
		You two will sleep beautifully in
		your tents.
			(beat)
		And stay there.

				SAMUEL
		And where will you sleep beautifully?

				REDBEARD
			(smile)
		Patterson and I will be in the old
		hospital- where the enticing smell
		of sickness still lingers-
			(beat)
		-and by the time we're done, I
		promise you, the odor of blood will
		be irresistible.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL. STARTING TO GET DARK.

Redbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the 
inside perimeter-

-buckets of blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Darker. They empty still more full buckets 
of blood. Redbeard seems pleased.

CUT TO

SAMUEL AND HAWTHORNE, hurrying toward their camp.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, leading Masai cattle into the grounds of 
the Old Hospital.

CUT TO

THE ORDERLIES IN THE NEW HOSPITAL, firmly closing and locking the 
gate.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, just outside the fence of the Old 
Hospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as 
they move.

CUT TO

THE SUN. Dying... dying...

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They slip inside the deserted Old 
Hospital, pull the gate securely shut.

CUT TO

THE CATTLE. They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling 
to each other.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. Full. Clean. The men are exhausted. Most are 
already asleep. The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything.

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL. Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their 
fire, waiting. The cows are quiet.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE by his fire near his tent with Samuel. Nervously, they 
drink tea.

CUT TO

THE MOON. Higher. An hour has passed. Perhaps more.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Walking the fence perimeter.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The cows are edgy. He calms the cows.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE OLD HOSPITAL. The large chunks of meat are visible in 
the moonlight.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. The orderlies are calm.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, still walking the perimeter.

CUT TO

PATTERSON sitting by the fire, staring at the night. Redbeard 
moves to him, speaks in a whisper.

				REDBEARD
		Think about something else.

				PATTERSON
		Have you ever failed?

				REDBEARD
			(sad smile)
		Only in life...
			(He walks away.
			Patterson watches.)

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. The Orderlies tend the sick. Quietly.

CUT TO

THE NIGHT AND THE MOON. Lovely.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly 
quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from 
Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the 
ripping of flesh-

CAMERA MOVES UP

Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in 
shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat.

Redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for 
Patterson to switch positions with him.

As he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops.

Silence again.

Patterson reaches the far side of the fence.

Now the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are 
outside, directly across from Patterson.

CUT TO

REDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going 
on, it's sure as hell odd.

CUT TO

THE CATTLE- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out 
violently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just 
before The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one-

-now a different sound is heard: scratching-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD tracking the sound-

-the main gate is starting to be pushed in. Inside the gate the 
ground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their 
buckets.

CUT TO

THE GATE. More pressure against it- it could give way any moment.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON and from the look on Redbeard's face, this 
is it! Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we-

CUT TO

THE CATTLE, going nuts and then-

CUT TO

THE GATE. All pressure gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Patterson is furious.

				PATTERSON
		Goddammit!

				REDBEARD
		It's all right. Stay ready.
			(indicates the blood)
		They know it's there.

Patterson takes a few steps away, stares at the moon.

CUT TO

REDBEARD; he studies Patterson who so clearly craves redemption.

				REDBEARD
			(going to him)
		Meant to ask you- the railroad car
		trap. Your idea?
			(Patterson nods)
		Excellent notion- I used the same
		device myself once.

				PATTERSON
		But of course yours worked.

				REDBEARD
		In point of fact it didn't- but I'm
		convinced the idea is sound.

He goes back to walking the perimeter. Patterson watches him- and 
for the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to 
lift.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL

and an ORDERLY, blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the 
fire and

CUT TO

THE SECOND ORDERLY rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before 
he can scream-

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS suddenly beside him, and their giant 
paws slap out so fast we can't follow and

CUT TO

THE SECOND ORDERLY, dropping to the ground, and now we're starting 
to spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning.

CUT TO

A TENT FULL OF SICK MEN with malaria and

CUT TO

A PAW flashing and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, lips pulling back and

CUT TO

A SICK MAN, falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed 
face and

CUT TO

TWO MORE SICK MEN, trying to rise and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, leaping on them and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, eyes narrow and brilliant and

CUT TO

A SICK COOLIE, and he's terrified and he tries to scream-

-the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry 
we've heard and

CUT TO

THE ENTIRE CAMP, NIGHT, WITH ALL THE FIRES BURNING- AND 
PATTERSON'S TENT AREA IS CLOSE BY-

-but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, rifles ready- but no sound reaches them.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it 
and he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel 
does his best to stop him-

-but Hawthorne rips free and we

CUT TO

A SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and

CUT TO

THE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and

CUT TO

MEDICINE, flying across the tent and

CUT TO

GLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and

CUT TO

A BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those 
terrible bright blazing eyes and

CUT TO

A TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this: 
destroying the New Hospital and

CUT TO

MORE TENTS collapsing and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs.

CUT TO

SHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we

CUT TO

THE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring 
around-

CUT TO

THE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone-

-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New 
Hospital and the instant they are heard

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open 
and they're off as we

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) 
The tents are all down. The place is devastated.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on.

CUT TO

PAN ALONG THE TENT

Dead. Blood. Pain.

PAN TO THE SECOND TENT

More dead.

More dying.

It's a slaughterhouse.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his 
last.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at 
each other-

-then they slow.

Because the New Hospital has come into view.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, CLOSE UP, staring at the disaster.

And this terrible crosses his face. For a moment, you think he's 
going to fall. His body seems drained of all its power. He stands 
there. Just stands there. Unable to move.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. And he does move. Slowly. Carefully. Into the chaos.

He stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere. 
Hawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone.

All that's left now is this: the sound of pain.

HOLD.

Dust rises. It covers everything. Only the sound remains.

Now different sounds take over-

-an incredible babble of human voices.

AND A RAILROAD TRAIN.

Patterson walks through the dust. Samuel, a worried look on his 
face, is a few steps behind.

We are at the STATION AREA and it is jammed. A train has pulled 
into the station-

-only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are 
workers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber 
up onto the roofs of the cars-

-covering the cars-

-everyone is leaving-

-Patterson can only watch.

Abdullah stands on one of the cars-

-the train begins to pull out of the station.

More and more workers chase after it, get pulled on.

Now the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full.

Patterson still watches, eyes vacant.

Abdullah sees him, looks away.

The train gathers speed.

Rounds a corner...

...gone...

Patterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. Samuel stays close 
behind him, the worried look still there.

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL.

A FEW AFRICAN ORDERLIES do the best they can. Patterson watches 
only a moment, walks on. Samuel still behind him.

CUT TO

THE CAMP as Patterson walks through. A ghost town now. Only 
Africans remain.

CUT TO

THE CONTRAPTION where the coolies missed The Darkness. Patterson 
looks at it a moment, walks on.

CUT TO

THE ANTHILL IN THE CLEARING where Patterson misfired. Patterson 
looks at it a moment, walks on. And now, at last-

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his 
tent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson.

IT'S A NECKLACE OF LION CLAWS.

Patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he 
never takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE.

It stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a 
lot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon. 
Desolate.

Redbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as 
he did the night before.

Patterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven, 
wrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace.

For a moment, neither says a word. Then-

				REDBEARD
			(out of the blue)
		It would have been a beautiful 
		bridge, John. I never noticed 
		before, occupied with other 
		business, I	suppose...
			(He's rambling)
		...never really pay much attention
		to that kind of thing but I've had
		the time today, nothing else on,
		and this... it's graceful and the
		placement couldn't be prettier...
		and...
			(He goes silent now,
			stares off)

				PATTERSON
		You just got hit.
			(Redbeard nods)
		The getting up is up to you- but
		they're only lions-
			(beat)
		-and I'm going after them crack
		of dawn...
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

A LONG SHOT OF A HIGH ROCKY CLIFF-

-we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet 
tall- gorgeous early morning light.

As we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the 
cliff.

As we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.

THE DOTS are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the 
rock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of 
course, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind. 
They travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM as they make it over the cliff face. They stand, 
stare out.

CUT TO

WHAT THEY SEE: the world. They move on.

CUT TO

A RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if 
you fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on 
their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard 
starts to speak. They don't stop moving.

				REDBEARD
		In my town, when I was little,
		there was a brute, a bully who
		terrorized the place.
			(beat)
		But he was not the problem. He
		had a brother who was worse than
		he. But the brother was not the
		problem.
			(beat)
		One or the other of them was
		usually in jail. The problem came
		when they were both free togther.
		The two became different from
		either alone.
			(beat)
		Alone they were only brutes.
		Together they became lethal,
		together they killed.

				PATTERSON
		What happened to them?

				REDBEARD
			(pause)
		I got big.
			(They move on)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's 
hard going. They help each other.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now. 
Slow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points-

CUT TO

A TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it: 
there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used 
it as a regular passage.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a 
word move through it.

CUT TO

THE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: 
a cave.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. Dark.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward 
it.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside.

CUT TO

WHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low 
tunnel you have to half-crawl through.

Without a word, they start inside.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel. 
Ahead there is light. They move on.

CUT TO

THE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just 
a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear.

Now they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- 
dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's 
dank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Thunderstruck-

				REDBEARD
		Dear God-
			(And on those words-)

CUT TO

THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE. More copper bracelets. And still more-

-and now bones-

-the floor of the place is littered with human bones-

-eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones.

				PATTERSON
		Their den?
			(Redbeard nods)
		Have you ever seen anything like
		this?

				REDBEARD
		Nobody's seen anything like this.
		Lions don't have caves like this-
			(beat)
		-they're doing it for pleasure.

CUT TO

SEVERAL TUNNELS, dark and ominous, leading from the cave-

-and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels-

-something is coming close and coming fast and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the 
sound explodes-

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL-

-shrieks-

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. What the hell is it?

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL- and here they come, screeching and angry-

-bats-

-swarms of them- hundreds of them-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, diving to the ground, lying there amidst 
the bangles and the bones and the skulls-

CUT TO

THE BATS. Circling above them. Screeching louder.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, lying very still, eyeless skulls all 
around, staring.

CUT TO

THE BATS. For a moment, it seems as if they might attack.

CUT TO

PATTRSON AND REDBEARD. Waiting, waiting. Then-

CUT TO

THE BATS  back into the tunnel and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, scrambling to their feet.

				REDBEARD
		One of my chief attributes is that
		I'm always calm.

And then without warning, from behind them, a roar-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD spin around, start back toward the entrance 
of the cave-

CUT TO

THE LOW ENTRANCE TUNNEL as they scramble half-crawling through it.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE as they make it, stand straight, look around-

CUT TO

THICK BUSH beyond- another roar and sudden movement and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, entering the thick bush- but carefully, 
because they are vulnerable now and an attack could come from 
anywhere- there is the sound of water-

-slashes of light hit their eyes, making it hard to see- and 
they're totally vulnerable now but it doesn't stop them- the water 
sound gets stronger- and as they burst clear-

CUT TO

AN AMAZING PLACE- AN AREA OF FLAT ROCK SPLIT UP AHEAD BY A WIDE 
FAST-RUNNING WATERFALL.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They look around. Nothing is there. But 
the spot is wide open, exposed.

				PATTERSON
			(The words pour out)
		Where could it have gone? How
		could it get across the water?
			(looks at Redbeard)
		They're only lions, yes?

				REDBEARD
			(shakes his head; he
			doesn't know)
		Don't they have to be?...

They look around a moment more. Nothing to see-

-they turn, leave, re-enter the thick bush. And now-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS- who knows where it is but it's there-

-watching Patterson.

HOLD BRIEFLY on The Darkness, then-

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. JUST BEFORE DAWN-

-outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones.

Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen. 
Patterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the 
other.

				SAMUEL
			(pointing)
		Both of them over there.

He is pointing to Patterson's area. Patterson goes to Redbeard.

				PATTERSON
		Ever have to use a machan?
			(Redbeard hasn't)
		I did once. In India. We will 
		tonight.
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

A CLEARING. LATER IN THE DAY.

Patterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd 
looking structure: four slender poles lashed together, slanting 
inward with a plank tied on top, a dozen feet up in the air. 
Redbeard and Samuel approach.

				PATTERSON
		They're used to people in trees,
		not in a clearing.
			(indicating the plank)
		It may be tight.

				REDBEARD
		Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's
		your idea, you go up there.
			(to Samuel)
		Take the others to the water tower
		for the night.

				PATTERSON
		I'll be bait alone?

				REDBEARD
		Yes. And I'll be in some distant
		tree where I can provide no
		assistance whatsoever.
			(beat)
		Can you control your fear?

				PATTERSON
		I'll have to.

				REDBEARD
		I can't control mine- I'd be lost
		without the shame factor driving me.

				PATTERSON
		Was that supposed to make me feel
		better?
			(Redbeard doesn't
			reply. Now-)

CUT TO

A DONKEY BEING LED IN. LATER.

THE MEN start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan.

Patterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support 
poles- they're rickety.

CUT TO

DUSK. The sun quickly beginning its quick fall.

CUT TO

THE WATER TOWER IN THE STATION AREA. Samuel is with the remaining 
men who clamber up to the platform on top.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY IN THE CLEARING. Quiet.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Redbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the 
plank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous.

CUT TO

THE PLANK as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages 
to sit.

CUT TO

THE VIEW. Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get 
comfortable. He can't.

				REDBEARD
			(glancing around)
		It's certainly the best chance
		they've had to kill you.

				PATTERSON
		You think they'll come then?
			(Redbeard does)
		Why?

				REDBEARD
			(not answering)
		Good luck.

				PATTERSON
		Why?

				REDBEARD
			(beat)
		Because I think they're after you.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to 
leave.

				PATTERSON
		How many do you think they've 
		killed?

				REDBEARD
			(reluctantly)
		The most of any lions... a 
		hundred...?
			(beat)
		Probably more.
			(Now Redbeard looks
			up at the younger man)
		Johnny...?

They study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been 
through a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when 
they first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand.

				REDBEARD
		Don't fuck up.
			(And he turns, never
			looks back, just goes)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He is alone now.

CUT TO

SHADOWS. Growing longer.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. It peers around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel-

-there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, 
the world could explode.

CUT TO

THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees. 
Nothing unusual.

MOVE IN CLOSER:

Redbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches.

CUT TO

THE SUN. About to die.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He 
stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, 
giving it color.

CUT TO

THE SUN and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just 
set, it literally drops out of the sky. Suddenly it's bright and 
in a blink it isn't. As it drops-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. It's madness that he's up here. And he knows 
it. And that shows.

CUT TO

THE SKY. No moon. Just thick cloud.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. Quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. On his precarious perch. He scans constantly ahead of 
him past the donkey.

CUT TO

THE THICK BUSH BEYOND THE DONKEY. Nothing moves-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He swallows, moistening his throat. He stares down at 
the donkey.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. LATER. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DARK.

And now, just the beginning of a mist.

CUT TO

THE SKY. THICKER AND THICKER CLOUDS. LATER STILL. GETTING TOWARD 
MORNING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends, 
listening for something, anything-

-but all there is is silence.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. It lies still and quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to 
scream.

CUT TO

THE BUSHES AROUND HIM. The mist is getting stronger.

CUT TO

REDBEARD in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing 
mist.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, listening, listening-

-and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear 
it but to Patterson it might as well be thunder-

-from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a 
twig.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY, and it's eyes widen-

HOLD ON THE DONKEY.

Because now something happens that hasn't happened before: 
suddenly there are no colors, only tones-

-because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's 
happening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of 
the lion-

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE EYES OF THE GHOST. Watching the donkey.

And from now on, when we are using PATTERSON'S POINT OF VIEW, 
everything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted.

When we are using THE GHOST'S POINT OF VIEW, everything is totally 
clear- and sounds are thunderous.

CUT TO

WHAT PATTERSON SEES: just mist and vaguely, bushes.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey. And CAMERA begins to move closer 
as The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be 
some movement in the bushes.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey, very, very close-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but 
the mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: THE DONKEY.

HOLD.

Now there is something else visible, something behind the donkey: 
the four legs of the platform.

HOLD.

Now we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together.

HOLD AS THE GHOST AT LAST SEES PATTERSON.

CUT TO

THE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts-

-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around 
the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He 
half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is 
behind him.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to 
change.

CUT TO

PATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about 
the donkey anymore, it's stalking him.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, 
always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know 
he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do 
anything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the 
lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite 
seen.)

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to 
let the animal's position out of his sight.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer...

CUT TO

PATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come 
apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on 
turning.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- 
that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, 
almost knocking him off the plank and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and 
he's trying not to fall and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and 
as he starts his leap-

CUT TO

REDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing 
his rifle, firing again and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, 
lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes 
and the night has him and

CUT TO

SUDDEN DAWN AND PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, running, stopping, staring 
at the ground-

CUT TO

THE GROUND. Blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving quickly forward again-

CUT TO

THE GROUND. More blood and...

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM, starting to slow-

CUT TO

STRANGE TERRAIN- huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen, 
some of them fifteen feet high, some even higher.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They separate, take different paths 
through the anthills.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Alert. One step at a time.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The same. One step at at time.

CUT TO

THE GHOST. Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, 
staring down at them both.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they 
might be statues.

CUT TO

THE ROCKY GROUND. Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them 
and as he does-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, launched in mid-air and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, in mid-air, body twisted and-

-and FREEZE.

Freeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky.

HOLD. THen-

CUT TO

SAMUEL, WALKING INTO THE SHOT-

-we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment 
when the three men brought the old man-eater into camp-

-only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the 
actual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead 
animal to the ground-

CUT TO

THE GHOST- and now there's a flash of light as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

BEAUMONT, kneeling by the dead animal. He is smiling beautifully, 
and there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face.

CUT TO

A PHOTOGRAPHER; loads of bulky equipment. Patterson and Redbeard 
stand behind him, watching him. We're in a lovely spot by the 
river. Patterson and Redbeard have definitely been drinking.

				BEAUMONT
		I think another for posterity-
		this is an important moment in
		my life.

He strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work.

				BEAUMONT
		Understand, I had help-

				PATTERSON
		-not a time for modesty, Bob-

				REDBEARD
		-undeniably your triumph.

				BEAUMONT
		Oh surely there's enough credit
		for us all- let's not forget, you
		did the actual shooting. Of course,
		I hired you, I was the general who
		put the team together. And generals
		are the ones who tend to be
		remembered.

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Perhaps you might put your head in
		its mouth, sir- could be a corker.

				BEAUMONT
		Clever idea, I like it.

CUT TO

THE MOUTH OF THE GHOST- it is huge-

-Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the 
enormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we

CUT TO

REDBEARD suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and

CUT TO

BEAUMONT, surprised and frightened-

-he jerks his head away-

-there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's-

-Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, 
humiliated, and as the laughter builds-

CUT TO

THE TENT AREA. NIGHT.

Patterson and Redbeard flank a fire. It's a sweet moment for them, 
their first, no fear in the vicinity.

It should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of 
champagne.

It should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away 
from the young man who went to meet Beaumont. He's unshaven, his 
eyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure- 
he is more at ease with the world.

				PATTERSON
			(drunk)
		I never thought I'd say this, but
		I'm glad you came.

				REDBEARD
			(drunk)
		Understood- you realize now you
		could never have done it without
		me.

				PATTERSON
		Actually, I could have done it
		much more easily without you, but
		for whatever reason, I'm glad you
		came.
			(They toast each other)

Samuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins 
them.

				SAMUEL
			(drunk)
		Where do you go next?

				REDBEARD
		Some Russian princes want to hunt
		the Himalayas. You?

				SAMUEL
		Help finish the railroad.

				PATTERSON
		I want to meet my son- he must be
		what, two months old?

They look at the fire a moment. Then-

				SAMUEL
		Three years I've worked for the
		railroad. Now I don't know why. It
		seemed a good idea once.

				PATTERSON
		I feel the same about the bridge.
		This country certainly didn't ask
		for it, doesn't need it.

				REDBEARD
		Too soon to tell.

They look at him.

				REDBEARD
		My life was shaped because someone
		invented gunpowder. Our lives have
		crossed because two lions went mad.
		But what if in the future the three
		of us do something grand for
		humanity? Was that worth all the
		lives? Too soon to tell.

				SAMUEL
			(drinks)
		Some mysteries should not have 
		solutions.

				REDBEARD
			(finishes his bottle,
			rises, looks at Patterson)
		Hold your son high.
			(And he turns, goes
			to his tent)

				PATTERSON
			(beat- quietly)
		He has children?

				SAMUEL
			(beat- quietly)
		Once...
			(HOLD on the two
			in the firelight. Then-)

CUT TO

THE STATION MASTER AT TSAVO STATION, WORKING IN HIS OFFICE. THE 
NEXT DAY.

				FEMALE VOICE (over)
		I'd like to see John Patterson,
		please.
			(As he looks up-)

CUT TO

HELENA standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but 
still lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is 
adorable.

				HELENA
		Could you tell him that his wife-
			(catches herself, smiles)
		-that his family has come to see him.
			(On that-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news- 
Patterson takes off running and

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back 
and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all 
but her heels.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station 
area.

CUT TO

HELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the 
building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, excitedly waving back and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly screaming "Get back- back-"

CUT TO

HELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- 
she smiles again, waves again and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, "GET BACK" and

CUT TO

HELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the 
same, she stops and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child.

CUT TO

HELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, starting to run and

CUT TO

PATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get 
there, he's never going to get there-

CUT TO

HELENA, and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she 
turns-

-but too late, too late as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, flying toward her now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, in agony.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as 
Helena cries out helplessly-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, crying out helplessly and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON IN HIS TENT,

continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had 
is over-

-he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE. It's dawn. Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the 
dream. He looks around.

Redbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it-

CUT TO

INSIDE THE TENT. It's empty. Patterson stares around-

-there is blood on the tent floor and quickly-

CUT TO

THE SUN. RISING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON running wildly, rifle in hand and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash 
across a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do, 
widening the area of search and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, veering off and

CUT TO

THORN TREES, as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the 
damage to his clothes or his skin and

CUT TO

MORE THORNS- he plunges wildly ahead and

CUT TO

A LARGE ANTHILL- it seems to be casting an unusual shadow- 
Patterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it-

-nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working 
overtime and is only getting worse-

Patterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do-

-and then SAMUEL'S VOICE on the wind- calling to him-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again, 
louder-

-Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend-

CUT TO

A FIELD OF WHITE GRASS. So lovely.

With one patch in the middle that is blood red.

Something is moving in the blood red area.

Patterson has his rifle ready-

-and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen 
something beyond imagination.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to 
where Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down 
into the grass-

-clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead. Patterson and 
Samuel stare mute at one another-

-and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar 
of The Darkness. They don't even react.

CUT TO

FLAMES RISING IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.

We should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this 
before.

START PULLING BACK.

Samuel stands there, trying to hold it together.

KEEP PULLING BACK.

Patterson stands there too, trying to hold it together.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

REDBEARD'S FUNERAL PYRE. Flames consume the body.

Just Patterson and Samuel. No one else is there.

The flames lick at the sky...

HOLD...

CUT TO

A LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING 
DARK NOW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use 
at the bridge, not far from the baboon.

				PATTERSON
		You're positive lions hate baboons?
			(Samuel is)
		Pebbles?
			(Samuel holds up a bag)
		Let's get it over with.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, 
fifteen feet from the baboon.

They help each other into position. Almost night.

CUT TO

THE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into 
the darkness.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble 
toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but 
irritation-

CUT TO

THE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S 
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

They're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries 
out.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; 
only nervous energy is keeping him going now.

CUT TO

THE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and 
frightening black clouds gather and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky 
is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to 
hallucinate.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM.

Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.

CUT TO

THE RIVER, raging and black and lethal.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, hallucinating again.

CUT TO

JUST BEFORE DAWN

and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge 
toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Firing-

CUT TO

-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and-

CUT TO

-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, 
turning back, ready to fire again-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS- gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around.

				PATTERSON
		Where is it?

				SAMUEL
			(pointing down)
		Underneath.
			(beat)
		Somewhere.

CUT TO

WHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes 
several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run.

They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we

CUT TO

EARLY MORNING LIGHT.

Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to 
the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson 
releases the baboon which races away.

CUT TO

WHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began 
construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away 
before them.

CUT TO

They begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully...

..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, 
making sure they miss nothing.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Ready for anything.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE up ahead of them. There are some holes.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL slowing.

CUT TO

THE HOLES. The nearest one is the largest.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. It seems empty.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. One step forward. Another. They hold their 
breaths.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. It seems empty.

CUT TO

A SHOT FROM BELOW BRIDGE LEVEL- The Darkness is there.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, firing.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, going down through another level of scaffolding.

CUT TO

PATTRSON AND SAMUEL, trying to track it.

CUT TO

THE SCAFFOLDING. Nothing is visible.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL- Frozen. They listen-

-nothing but their breathing.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, looking around everywhere.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. Nothing.

CUT TO

THE FIRST LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

CUT TO

THE SECOND LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, looking this way, that way.

SHOCK CUT TO

THE HOLE AS THE DARKNESS JUST FUCKING FLIES OUT OF IT- Patterson 
falls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it 
gets up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning for Samuel's rifle-

-only Samuel isn't there-

-he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS ROARING AND

CUT TO

PATTERSON and he turns, starts running too, running across the 
narrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without 
slipping or falling and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it 
takes off after Patterson and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the 
nearest tree and

CUT TO

PATTERSON running for his life across the bridge and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a 
dead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary 
speed, it's still faster than Patterson and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and he's never gone this fast in his life and

CUT TO

THE TREE HE'S HEADED FOR, a different one from Samuel's and it's 
just up ahead and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, closing and

CUT TO

THE TREE, and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, springing into the air now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both 
hands, swinging his body up as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the 
branch and now comes this insane roar and

CUT TO

SAMUEL with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen 
feet up.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's 
tree, raging with frustration.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks 
across at the next tree not far away where Samuel is-

				SAMUEL
			(embarrassed)
		Afraid of lions.

CUT TO

PATTERSON.

				PATTERSON
		It's all right, Samuel- we all
		get hit-
			(Now he shuts up 
			fast and-)

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb 
the tree after Patterson. Lions are cats and when they want to 
climb, up they go and that's what The Darkness is doing now, going 
up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and it's terrifying- he reaches for the branch above, 
climbing higher and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there 
is a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, going still higher but the branches are getting thinner 
and the tree is shaking, and he could fall-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, climbing on, nothing can stop it-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS, together in the tree, and there's no 
further Patterson can go and it's harder for The Darkness too, but 
slowly it moves in and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, calling out-

				PATTERSON
		Samuel!
			(And he gestures for
			the rifle and the
			instant he does-)

CUT TO

SAMUEL, and he takes the rifle between his two hands and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, steadily moving in and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, tossing the rifle with great care and Patterson's less 
than fifteen feet away and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, hands out to catch it and

CUT TO

THE RIFLE in mid-air and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, both hands ready and

CUT TO

THE RIFLE as it strikes a tree branch, spins away to the ground.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, almost on Patterson now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly leaping out of the tree, and yes it's a long 
way and sure it's going to damage him but sometimes there aren't a 
lot of choices in this world and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, staring as Patterson falls and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, crashing hard to earth, stunned, hurt, ribs broken, leg 
broken and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and it's so big it's hard for it to get room to turn 
but it does and

CUT TO

PATTERSON crawling for the rifle, and he's in terrible pain but he 
reaches the weapon, grabs for it and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, skittering down the tree and as it reaches the 
ground

CUT TO

PATTERSON, forcing himself to his feet and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its 
charge.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, aims, fires and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, hit again and down it goes again but up it comes 
again and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, firing the final shot and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, hit again and it has to stop, it just has to-

-but it doesn't.

It roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON; all bullets gone, no place to hide.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS. Still moving forward.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a 
branch, lands hard and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now 
four, now-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, helpless on the ground.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and the eyes glow-

-a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge 
teeth into the branch-

-now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Can't breathe.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. And suddenly he just empties and tears pour 
down his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with 
sobs. He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS. Just the sound of Patterson's tears...

HOLD.

KEEP HOLDING.

CAMERA BEGINS TO RISE-

-WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BRIDGE NOW- AND IT'S FINISHED!

-hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it-

-Samuel is there- lighting up the world with his smile-

-and Patterson's there, too. He stands with Helena, his young son 
in his arms.

Everybody smiles, everybody waves, the train goes triumphantly by.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He looks wonderful again, vibrant and young. Watching 
him, you might think he hadn't been through the nightmare as he 
stands there, holding the boy tightly.

But with his other hand, he fingers the lion claw necklace...

HOLD ON PATTERSON.

Now slowly dissolve to an African evening. Animals stretch from 
one horizon to the other.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Here we still wonder about them.
		How did they escape for nine months?
		And kill 135 men? And stop the
		railroad?
			(beat)
		And were they only lions?
			(beat)
		If you want to decide for yourself,
		you must go to America. They are at
		the Field Museum in Chicago, and
		even now, after they have been dead
		a century, if you dare to lock eyes
		with them...
			(beat)
		...you will be afraid.

In the distance, the animals continue to move.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Sleep well.

HOLD ON THE ANIMALS. They seem to go on forever...

FINAL FADE OUT.

							 FADE IN

	INT. BARGE - DAY

	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

				EPPS
		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

				GREER
		What's slow?

				EPPS
		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

				DODGE
		Where from?

				EPPS
		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

				GREER
		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

				DODGE
		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
		Greer to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

				GREER
		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

				MURPHY
		Of course they did.

				GREER
		Let the buyer beware.

				MURPHY
		What do you say, Dodge?

				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

				VASILI
		I thought you say Tuesday.

				MURPHY
		Better late than never.

				VASILI
			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

				MURPHY
		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

				VASILI
		No, no. You got leak.

				MURPHY
		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

				VASILI
		That cost me twenty grand at least.

				MURPHY
		Fifteen, at the most.

				VASILI
		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

				MURPHY
		You're kidding, right?

				VASILI
		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

				GREER
		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

				MURPHY
		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

				GREER
		I must be in the wrong business.

				MURPHY
		You got that right.

				GREER
			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

				DODGE
		Much obliged, skipper.

	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

	AT A TABLE

	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

				GREER
		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

				DODGE
		With that coxswain dickhead.

				MURPHY
		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

				DODGE
		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

				DODGE
		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

				GIRLFRIEND
		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

				EPPS
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

				GIRLFRIEND
		This "guy" is my man, honey.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene --

				GIRLFRIEND
		You, shut up.

				EPPS
			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

				GIRLFRIEND
			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

				MURPHY
			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

				RIVETER
		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

				MURPHY
		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

				RIVETER
		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

				MURPHY
		I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
		ignore you. Epps, let's go.

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

				RIVETER
		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

				MURPHY
		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

				RIVETER
		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

				MURPHY
		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

				EPPS
		Morning everybody.

				GREER
		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

				EPPS
		Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
		that.

				GREER
		I bet you did.

				MURPHY
		Candy?

				EPPS
		It's my pen name.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

	Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
	the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

				GREER
		Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

				MURPHY
		Red sky in morning, sailor take 
		warning.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
	under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

				DODGE
		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

				EPPS
		One more?

				DODGE
		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

				DODGE
		What is your first name?

				EPPS
		What?

				DODGE
		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		What?

				EPPS
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		Maureen?

	She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

				EPPS
		What's yours?

	Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

				DODGE
		Roger.

				EPPS
		Roger?

				DODGE
		Yeah.

	She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

				DODGE
		You think that's funny

				EPPS
			(lying)
		No.

	She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT

	THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
	through a steady chop and a mild swell.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
	as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
	the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
	picks up a walkie-talkie.

				GREER
			(into walkie)
		Greer to Murphy.

	Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

				MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
		Yeah.

				GREER
		There's a large vessel out about ten 
		miles to the north-west.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
	radio.

				GREER
		I been watching it for close to an 
		hour and it hasn't moved. I can't 
		raise it on the radio either. Makes 
		me think it might be in trouble.

				MURPHY
		Alright. I'll be right up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright 
	point of light in the middle of nowhere.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Merchant vessel at position one seven 
		four one five west, five seven seven 
		five north.

	Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge 
	standing back.

				MURPHY
		This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner 
		two. Over.

	Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio 
	speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Merchant vessel at one seven four 
		one five west, five seven seven five 
		north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior 
		whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero 
		niner two. Over.

	Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on 
	the screen.

				MURPHY
		Too deep to anchor out there.

				GREER
		Looks like it's adrift.

				EPPS
		Could be a fishing boat.

				GREER
		Too big. More like a freighter.

				MURPHY
		What the hell would a freighter be 
		doing up here? It's way out of the 
		lanes. There's not a port for 800 
		miles.

				DODGE
		Smugglers maybe.

				GREER
		Smuggling what? Tundra grass?

	A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

				MURPHY
		Merchant vessel at position one seven 
		four one five west, five seven seven 
		five north, this is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Do you copy? Over.

	Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.

				GREER
		Call the Coastguard?

				MURPHY
		Steer to one eight five. Let's check 
		her out.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

	Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

				MURPHY
		Alright. Back it off.

	Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

				MURPHY
		Hit the lights.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
	illuminating the water in front of the boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
	light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
	beam of light with a joy stick.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
	over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
	when a shadow looms into view.

				MURPHY
		Whoa, whoa.

	Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
	looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

	As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
	bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
	above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
	what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
	around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
	alleys.

				MURPHY
		"Chimera."

	Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

				MURPHY
		Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
	rising above it.

				MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
		This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

	The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy raises the mic again.

				MURPHY
		Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
		bow. Is there anyone aboard?

	They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
	glare of their lights.

				MURPHY
		Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
		tight.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
	crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
	the movement of the water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
	making their way up under the floodlights.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
	jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
	superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
	lending a still darker ominousness to it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
	as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
	seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
	apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
	light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
	here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

				GREER
			(into radio)
		Talk to me, skipper.

	After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

				MURPHY
		We're in a stairwell just under the 
		main superstructure.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

				MURPHY
		This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
		sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
		service for at least twenty years. 
		Probably a lot longer.

	They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
	takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
	revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
	equipment, a few pots still hanging.

	They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
	passageway.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge look on.

				MURPHY
		It's funny.

				GREER
		How's that?

				MURPHY
		Besides a little rust, everything's 
		pretty well-preserved.

	Greer and Dodge look at each other.

				MURPHY
		How she got out here is one hell of 
		a good question.
			(a long beat, then)
		Jesus.

	Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the 
	other end.

				GREER
		What is it?

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy.

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy, goddamit.

				MURPHY
			(finally)
		Sorry.

	Another beat in silence.

				GREER
		What is it?

	INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
	an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
		It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
		passenger ship.

	Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
	opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
	and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
	hanging over it all.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
	meet them at the bottom.

				MURPHY
			(jumping down)
		There's nobody on that boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

				DODGE
		Probably slipped her moorings, got 
		tangled up in a current.

				EPPS
		Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
		foot passenger liner drifted out of 
		Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
		bump into her until now?

				DODGE
		Somebody's probably looking for her 
		as we speak.

				MURPHY
		Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
		and abandoned. We've got every right 
		to salvage her.

				GREER
		You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
		thousand ton ship you're talking 
		about.

				MURPHY
		We've done it before.

				DODGE
		Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
		the other. But we got half the Bering 
		Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
		drag her over.

				MURPHY
		You have any idea how much a ship 
		like that could be worth in salvage? 
		The fittings alone could go for a 
		few million.

				DODGE
		If you get it back in one piece.

				MURPHY
		It's a risk I'm willing to take.

				GREER
		All we got to do is hit some rough 
		weather and you can forget about it.

				MURPHY
		So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
		A little weather couldn't be anything 
		she hasn't seen before.

				DODGE
		It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
		One boat can't control a ship that 
		size.

				MURPHY
		The damn thing's been floating around 
		for God knows how long and it hasn't 
		hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
		A little of the old push pull.

	A long beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
		check for a minute. You know I've 
		been good to you. But I'm prepared 
		to offer you something better now.
			(a beat)
		If we do this right, it's worth a 
		lot of money. A lot of money.

	They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

				EPPS
		Go on.

				MURPHY
		Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
		could come in around four million

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
	operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
	dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
	starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
	his face out from the other side.

				DODGE
		Ready?

				EPPS
		Bring it on, dude.

	Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
	a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
	the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
	the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
	it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

				EPPS
		OK.

	Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
	through the anchor alleys.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally)
		Hit it!

	Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
	cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
	hull with a shower of black rust.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
	cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
	alley.

	It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
	it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
	and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
	entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
	deck.

	The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills 
	out of the anchor alley before Epps.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat 
	toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and 
	stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek 
	dangerously close to his face, until...

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor 
	alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A 
	beat as she holds there.

		Dodge? You alright?

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge lies tangled in the winch.

				DODGE
		Yes!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down 
	into the water and come up again from the water to the tow 
	anchor on the tug's stern.

	Dodge looks on as Greer and Epps stand by. He raises his 
	walkie.

				DODGE
		Alright, skipper, real easy.

	Murphy slowly throttles up, moving the boat forward. He turns

	Dodge, Epps and Greer look on as the tow cables begin to 
	rise in their wake.

		Throttle back.

	The tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water.

				DODGE
		More.

	The tug slows still more.

				DODGE
		More.

	It slows still more, until the tug just creeps along, and 
	the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water, 
	straightening as the slack is pulled out.

	Some fifty yards behind the tug, the tow cables come taught 
	in the anchor alleys of the Chimera.

	Greer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand 
	over the map table.

				MURPHY
		With a little extra fuel, weather 
		permitting, we should make Sitka in 
		five days without another stop.

				DODGE
		Sounds reasonable.

				GREER
		Hypothetically speaking, what if we

				DODGE
		They shoulda thought of that when

		I don't care what, ain't nobody just

		The law's on our side. If they want

	inside.

				DODGE
		Mother fucker!

				MURPHY
		What is it?

		Threw a turbine blade.

	Dodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum

		Son of a bitch!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck.

		How long to fix?

		Hard to say. I gotta get in there

		I'd sure like to get my hands on the

	Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang.

				GREER
		That must be the old man right there.

	The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man 
	from another century, with dark, hollow eyes.

	Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.

				EPPS
		Coffee?

			(sitting up)
		Yeah. Thanks.

	She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back 
	from the Chimera.

				EPPS
			(taking a seat)
		What'd you find up there?

				MURPHY
		Some charts. A crew manifest.
			(looking them over)
		Looks like her last voyage was January 
		1953. The question is where the hell's 
		she been since.

				EPPS
		She was sailing up north, right?

				MURPHY
		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

				EPPS
		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

				MURPHY
		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

				MURPHY
		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

				EPPS
		So what did happen?

				MURPHY
		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

				EPPS
		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

				MURPHY
		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

				EPPS
		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

				MURPHY
		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane 
	hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.  
	Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

				MURPHY

				DODGE
		Turbine rotor's shot.

				MURPHY
		I thought you said it was just a

				MURPHY
		How much longer's that gonna take?

				DODGE
		Like I always say --

				MURPHY
		I know I know, two ways to do anything --

				DODGE
		The right way and the wrong way.

				MURPHY
		But how long?

				DODGE
		Hard to say.

				MURPHY
		We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A 
		storm blows up and we're history.

				DODGE
		I'm telling you, you don't want to 
		be running that fan like it is.

				MURPHY
		What about running number two by 
		itself?

				DODGE
		It's a full 2500 horses down. We 
		couldn't drag that boat down hill on 
		ice with it.

				MURPHY
		How long, then?

				DODGE
		I gotta pull the blades and re-seat 
		everything in a new rotor -- .

				MURPHY
		How long?

				DODGE
		Three, four days.

				MURPHY
		Goddamit, Dodge.

				DODGE
		What do you want me to tell you,

	She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera 
	can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
	sea.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
	diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 
	4' stack of gold ingots.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		What the fuck we gonna do with it?

	Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

				GREER
		What the fuck you think we gonna do 
		with it? It's ours, baby. It's all 
		ours.

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

				GREER
		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

				MURPHY
			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

				GREER
		Ho, baby!

				EPPS
		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

				MURPHY
		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		It's a hell of a lot of money.

				DODGE
		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

				MURPHY
		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

				GREER
		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

				MURPHY
		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

				EPPS
		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

				MURPHY
		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

				GREER
		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

				EPPS
		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

				DODGE
			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

				MURPHY
		Then it happened before they scuttled 
		her.

				EPPS
		You mean, before she sank.

				GREER
		Cargo like this could make a crew 
		think twice.

				MURPHY
		That it could.

	A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
	galley table.

				GREER
		Then why didn't they take it.

				EPPS
		Probably didn't have time.

				DODGE
		Or somebody stopped them.

				MURPHY
		Either way, they must've had a pretty 
		good reason.

				GREER
		Must be a damn good reason to jump 
		ship and leave fifty million dollars 
		aboard.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

				MURPHY
		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

				DODGE
		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

				MURPHY
		It looks like it.

	A beat as they let this sink in.

				GREER
		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

				MURPHY
		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

				DODGE
		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty 
		million bucks?

				MURPHY
		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
		it is.

				GREER
		Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
		big piece of shit all the way back 
		to Sitka.

				MURPHY
		It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
		Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
		the salvage.

				EPPS
		Why not call for help?

				MURPHY
		For now the best thing we can do is 
		to keep quiet about this.

				DODGE
		Last thing we want is extra partners.

				EPPS
		Or uninvited guests.

				GREER
		I heard that.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

				MURPHY
		The sooner we get under way, the 
		sooner we are to spending what's 
		ours.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum 
	fitting over one of the open turbines.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space 
	beyond the twisted hatch.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one.
			(as Epps stacks the 
			last one)
		Two twenty two.

	Greer makes a note.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty two kilograms of 
		solid gold.

				EPPS
		That's what I call a payday.

				GREER
		Hell yeah.

	They slap hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door 
	marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
	dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
	windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
	ordered and in its place.

	Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
	it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
	drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
	protractor amidst other sundry items.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in 
	on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered 
	curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of 
	slippers lie beneath it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
	time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
	shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
	at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
	EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
	ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
	is tied.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
	from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
	the deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
	hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
	coming to the engine room door.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

				DODGE
			(over the roar)
		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

				DODGE
		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
	smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
	but the fire is out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
	leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

				DODGE
		One minute I'm minding my own 
		business, the next thing I know the 
		whole place is burning up.
			(taking a drag)
		An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
		welder. Started an oil fire.

				GREER
		Looks like it took out the backup 
		genny too.

				MURPHY
		Terrific.

	Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

				MURPHY
		How's that leg?

	Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

				DODGE
		Seen better -- Ow!

	Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

				EPPS
		This's gonna hurt a little.

				DODGE
		Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

	Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

				GREER
		What now?

				MURPHY
		We could call for help.

				GREER
		And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
		around here?

				EPPS
		What other choices have we got?

				DODGE
		I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
		be towing no ship now.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and 
	takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under 
	the stark light of a gas lantern.

				GREER
		Fifty million four ways. That's twelve 
		million and change a piece.  What 
		you gonna do with your share, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Not much at all, I guess. Retire.  
		Live out my golden years and all 
		that.

				DODGE
		I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.  
		Spend my time hauling rich Seattle 
		business men through the Puget.

				MURPHY
		How about you Epps?

				EPPS
		Guess I'll just keep working.

				DODGE
		What're you crazy?

				EPPS
		I like my job.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

				GREER
		Moving to Sweden.

				DODGE
		What's so great about Sweden?

				GREER
		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

				EPPS
		That's a good thing?

				GREER
		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder 
		the better.

				DODGE
		Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish 
		girls you only gonna dream about.

				GREER
		We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

				MURPHY
		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be 
		doing if we don't get this boat 
		running.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah.

	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

				GREER
		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

				EPPS
		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

				DODGE
		Sounds like the hull.

				MURPHY
		Warm water current maybe, making the 
		metal expand.

				GREER
		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
	halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
	which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
	crumbling in her hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
	a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
	holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
	watch and fob, and a room key.

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
	folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
	holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
	presumably his wife.

	INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

				EPPS
		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

				EPPS
		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

				EPPS
		Did you see him?

				MURPHY
		Who?

				EPPS
		The guy. He just came this way.

				MURPHY
		What guy?

				EPPS
		There's somebody else on this boat.

				MURPHY
		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

				EPPS
		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

				MURPHY
		Are you sure?

				EPPS
		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

				MURPHY
		You sure it wasn't me?

				EPPS
		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

				DODGE
		Light in those passages ain't so 
		good.

				EPPS
		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

				GREER
		What'd he look like?

				EPPS
		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

				DODGE
		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

				GREER
		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

				EPPS
		Maybe that is his boat.

				DODGE
		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

				MURPHY
		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

				DODGE
		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

				MURPHY
		Not in the eyes of the law.

				EPPS
		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

				MURPHY
		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

				DODGE
		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

				MURPHY
		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

				DODGE
		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

				DODGE
		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

				EPPS
		So we kill him?

				DODGE
		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

				GREER
		I don't know.

				MURPHY
		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

				GREER
		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

				DODGE
		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

				EPPS
		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

				GREER
		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

				MURPHY
		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.
			(a beat)
		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

				DODGE
		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

				MURPHY
		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

				EPPS
		Guess that'd be me. Again.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

				GREER
		Pretty low all around.

				MURPHY
		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

				EPPS
		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

				MURPHY
		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

				DODGE
		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

				DODGE
		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

				EPPS
			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

				MURPHY
		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

				EPPS
		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

				GREER
		Coffee.

				EPPS
			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

				MURPHY
		Got your light?

				EPPS
		Yup.

				DODGE
		Smokes?

				EPPS
		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

				EPPS
		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

				MURPHY
		You just shoot at something?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

				GREER (O.S.)
		Ho-ly shit.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

				MURPHY
		Bodies're too fresh.

				DODGE
		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

				MURPHY
		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

				GREER
		And look what happened.

				DODGE
		Damn barbaric is what it is.

				MURPHY
		Could be meant as a warning.

				GREER
		Stay away. Or else.

				EPPS
		Because of the gold.

				MURPHY
		That'd be my guess.

				DODGE
		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

				GREER
		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

				MURPHY
		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

				EPPS
		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				DODGE
		Let's not be too hasty.

				GREER
		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
	turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
	smoke.

				DODGE
		All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

				MURPHY
		Can't you use something else?

				DODGE
		I might be able to find something on 
		the ship. But it's gonna take time.

				MURPHY
		Do what you need to do. Just do it 
		fast.

				DODGE
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	Epps sleeps in her bunk.

	INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

	Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

				DODGE
		I need lag bolts, especially one 
		inch standard. And sheet metal.  
		Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
		of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
		do.

				GREER
		I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
		know.

				DODGE
		You find anything that even looks 
		like a compressor. I don't care what, 
		grab it.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

				GREER
		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

				GREER
		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

				GREER
		Dodge!

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
	Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
	vessel 'China Sea.'"

				MURPHY
		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
	SOS."

	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
	CLOSES AGAIN.

	Murphy takes the radio.

				MURPHY
		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

				VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know, but won't say so."

	Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
	someone were there but not speaking.

				MURPHY
		Who is this!!

	The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
	Murphy squeezes the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer! Dodge!

	Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
	CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
	sounds.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(taking radio)
		Murphy.

				DODGE
		You better get down here quick, 
		skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		I think you better see this for 
		yourself.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
	Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
	from the open door as he approaches.

	AT CABIN 400

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

				DODGE
		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

				GREER

		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

	As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Hard to say.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

				EPPS
		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

				DODGE
		A what?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

				DODGE
		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

				MURPHY
		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

				EPPS
		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

				DODGE
		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

				EPPS
		Greer?

				MURPHY
		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

				MURPHY
		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

				DODGE
		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

				EPPS
			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

				MURPHY
		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	No response.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. 
		This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic 
		Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner

		Chimera. Over.

	Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
	comes open and Murphy steps in.

				MURPHY
		How's he doing?

				EPPS
		Same. Any luck?

				MURPHY
		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

				EPPS
			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
		SOS.

				MURPHY
		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

				DODGE
			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

				MURPHY
		If they knew what they were carrying.

				EPPS
		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

				MURPHY
		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

				EPPS
		Only something must've gone wrong.

				DODGE
		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

				MURPHY
		How do you mean?

				DODGE
		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

				MURPHY
		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

				MURPHY
		What do you propose?

				DODGE
		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

				MURPHY
		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

				DODGE
		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

				MURPHY
		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

				MURPHY
		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

				DODGE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

				MURPHY
		I think you know.

				DODGE
		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

				MURPHY
		The radio!

				DODGE
			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

				DODGE
		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

				MURPHY
		You smashed it!

				DODGE
		What?!

				MURPHY
		Don't lie to me!

				DODGE
		What the fuck -- ?

				MURPHY
		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Conveniently enough for you.

				DODGE
		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

				DODGE
		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

				EPPS
		It's Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

				GREER
		Never been more thirsty in my life.

				MURPHY
		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

				MURPHY
		How're you feeling?

				GREER
		Lost my sea legs.

				EPPS
		Any dizziness?

				GREER
		No.

				EPPS
		Headache, nausea, lights?

				GREER
		Lights?

				EPPS
		Sudden flashes of light.

				GREER
		I feel fine.

				DODGE
		What day is it?

				GREER
		I don't know. Tuesday?

				DODGE
		Wrong. It's Friday.

				EPPS
		Try Wednesday.

				DODGE
		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

				GREER
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		You don't remember?

				GREER
		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

				MURPHY
		You've been out for about a day.

				GREER
		Say what?

				MURPHY
		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

				GREER
		Oh, man.

				MURPHY
		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

				GREER
		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

				MURPHY
		The ah... the radio's out.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		Smashed it up pretty bad.

				EPPS
		But, who -- ?

				DODGE
		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

				EPPS
		Did you?

				DODGE
		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

	WITH EPPS

	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

				EPPS
		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

				EPPS
		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

				EPPS
		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

				MURPHY
		February first.

				EPPS
		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

				MURPHY
		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

				EPPS
		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

				MURPHY
		Collision? With what?

				EPPS
		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

				MURPHY
		But where's the damage?

				EPPS
		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

				MURPHY
		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Yeah.

				DODGE
		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

				MURPHY
		What the hell happened!

				DODGE
		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

				GREER
		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

				MURPHY
		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

				MURPHY
		Dodge!

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

	WITH DODGE

	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

	WITH DODGE

	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

	WITH DODGE

	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

	WITH DODGE

	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

				GREER
		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

				GREER
		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

				MURPHY
		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

				EPPS
		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

				MURPHY
		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

				DODGE
		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

				GREER
		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

				DODGE
		The turbine blew.

				GREER
		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

				MURPHY
			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

				GREER
		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

				MURPHY
		Shut up.

				GREER
		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

				MURPHY
		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

				MURPHY
		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

	A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

				MURPHY
		So just stow it. You understand?
			(a beat)
		We don't need this right now.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
	sit around it in silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
	as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
	under it. She sits down, trying it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

				DODGE
		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

				DODGE
		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

				MURPHY
		If money can buy what he wants.

				DODGE
		I don't figure there's much I want 
		money can't buy.

				MURPHY
		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

				MURPHY
		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

				DODGE
		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
	top deck.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
	broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

	INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

	Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
	scavenging for food.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

				GIRL
		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

				GIRL
		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

				EPPS
		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

				EPPS
		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

				EPPS
		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

				EPPS
		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

				DODGE
		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

				GREER
		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

				MURPHY
		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

				DODGE
		There's a charming thought.

				GREER
		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

				DODGE
		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

				EPPS
			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

				GREER
		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

				GREER
		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

				MURPHY
		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

	WITH GREER AND MURPHY

	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

				MURPHY
		It's a Noaa buoy.

				GREER
		A what?

				MURPHY
		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

				MURPHY
		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

	ON THE BUOY

	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy corrects.

				EPPS
		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

	ON THE BUOY

	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy yanks on the line.

	ON THE BUOY

	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

	ON THE BUOY

	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

				GREER
		We're still drifting.

				MURPHY
		The mooring hasn't come taught.

				EPPS
		It's not gonna hold us.

				MURPHY
		Doesn't matter.

	ON THE BUOY

	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

				DODGE
		No fucking way.

	ON THE BUOY

	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

				MURPHY
		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

				EPPS
		Hey.

				MURPHY
		Hey.

				EPPS
		Couldn't sleep.

				MURPHY
		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

				EPPS
		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

				MURPHY
		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

				EPPS
		The what?

				MURPHY
		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

				EPPS
		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

				MURPHY
		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

				EPPS
		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

				MURPHY
		Not our mystery guest again.

				EPPS
		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

				MURPHY
		What, like some kind of ghost?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

				EPPS
		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

				EPPS
		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

				MURPHY
		Showing you what?

				EPPS
		What happened.

				MURPHY
		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

				EPPS
		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

				MURPHY
		Victims of what?

				EPPS
		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

				MURPHY
		That much I think we've already 
		established.

				EPPS
		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

				EPPS
		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

				MURPHY
		What's that supposed to mean?

				EPPS
		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

				MURPHY
		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

				EPPS
		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

				MURPHY
		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

				MURPHY
		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

				MURPHY
		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

				MURPHY
		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

				EPPS
		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally, from inside)
		What?

				EPPS
		Get up.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

				MURPHY
		You're late.

				DODGE
		Sorry.

				MURPHY
			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

				DODGE
			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

				DODGE
		Dodge.

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

				DODGE
		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
	THE RADIO:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

				DODGE
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

				DODGE
		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
		.

	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

	ON SHOTGUN

	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

				MURPHY
		Dodge?

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps shines her light on something.

				EPPS
		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

				GREER
		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

				EPPS
		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

				MURPHY
		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

				MURPHY
		He took the shotgun and a light.

				GREER
		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
			(into radio)
		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Epps? You there?

				EPPS
		Right here.

	WITH MURPHY

	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

	WITH GREER

	As Greer moves along too.

				GREER
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

				GREER
		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

				GREER
		You okay?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

				GREER
		What?

				EPPS
		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

	MOVING WITH EPPS

	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

	WITH THE LIGHT

	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

				GREER
		Can't find the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

				GREER
		Doesn't look like it much matters.

				EPPS
		What do we do with him?

				MURPHY
		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

				GREER
		What about the gold?

				MURPHY
		Leave it.

				GREER
		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

				MURPHY
		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

				GREER
		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

				EPPS
		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

				GREER
		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

				MURPHY
		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

				GREER
		Fine with me.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

	AT THE TABLE

	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

				EPPS
		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

				EPPS
		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

				EPPS
		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

				EPPS
		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

				EPPS
			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	CUT TO BLACK

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	OUTSIDE

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

				MURPHY (V.O.)
		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

				MURPHY
		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

				MURPHY
		What do you think?

				EPPS
		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like 
		wild dogs."

				MURPHY
		Over the gold.

				EPPS
		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

				EPPS
		They went crazy.

				MURPHY
		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
	and Murphy stand over it.

				MURPHY
		We lash a few of these together it 
		might get us far enough into the 
		shipping lanes to be rescued.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

				MURPHY
		Hard to say which is worse, staying 
		here or taking our chances in open 
		water.

				EPPS
		If the weather holds it might not be 
		so bad.

				MURPHY
		It's not the weather I'm worried 
		about. The wrong current could drag 
		us as far as the Aleutians before we 
		come across another boat.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
	a single usable raft.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

	Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
	light from the skylight falling on him from above.

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

				EPPS
			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

				EPPS
		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
	RADIO.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
	THE CORRIDOR.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

				THE GIRL
		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

				FATHER
		What do you think?

				MOTHER
		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

				FATHER
		I thought this was all the rage.

				KATIE
		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

				FATHER
		What about this year?

				KATIE
		It's not your color anyway.

				GIRL
		I like it, daddy.

				FATHER
		Well thank you!

				GIRL
		Daddy, how much longer before we 
		start moving again?

				FATHER
		They're working on the engines, honey. 
		As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
		our way.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

	EPPS' POV

	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

				MUTINEER
		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

				EPPS (V.O.)
		NO!!!!

	BACK TO SCENE

	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

				KATIE
		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

				KATIE
		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

				MURPHY
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

				EPPS
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
	mine field for a drifting ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

				EPPS
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		We hit land.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		We're in an island chain. It's only 
		a matter of time before we hit another 
		one.

				EPPS
		Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
		tank.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

	AT THE OTHER END

	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

				EPPS
		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

				MURPHY
		Let's get the hell out of here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

				MURPHY
		It should be enough to get us to one 
		of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

				MURPHY
		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

	AT THE STANDS

	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

				MURPHY
		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

				EPPS
		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

				EPPS
		You killed them.

				MURPHY
		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

				EPPS
		So you killed them?

				MURPHY
		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

				EPPS
		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

				MURPHY
		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

				EPPS
		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

				MURPHY
		I think I see it pretty well.

				EPPS
		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

				MURPHY
		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

				EPPS
		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

				MURPHY
		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

				EPPS
		I don't give a damn about the gold.

				MURPHY
		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
	rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

				MURPHY
		There's no reason to make this any 
		more difficult than it has to be.

	WITH EPPS

	As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
	herself up and climbs inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
	width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
	where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
	it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
	passageway.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

	AT THE BOTTOM

	Epps gets up, runs.

	WITH MURPHY

	Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

	INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
	GROWS STILL LOUDER.

	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
	rock promontory of a small island.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
	water pouring in behind it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
	huge gash rising on its port side.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
	through the breach.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
	of the passage. He begins backing away.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
	half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
	EXERTION.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
	compartment.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
	the bulkhead.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
	Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
	his pockets.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
	trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

	ABOVE THE WATER

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps collapses on the rocks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

	FADE TO BLACK

			 THE END

							 FADE IN

	INT. BARGE - DAY

	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

				EPPS
		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

				GREER
		What's slow?

				EPPS
		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

				DODGE
		Where from?

				EPPS
		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

				GREER
		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

				DODGE
		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
		Greer to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

				GREER
		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

				MURPHY
		Of course they did.

				GREER
		Let the buyer beware.

				MURPHY
		What do you say, Dodge?

				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

				VASILI
		I thought you say Tuesday.

				MURPHY
		Better late than never.

				VASILI
			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

				MURPHY
		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

				VASILI
		No, no. You got leak.

				MURPHY
		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

				VASILI
		That cost me twenty grand at least.

				MURPHY
		Fifteen, at the most.

				VASILI
		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

				MURPHY
		You're kidding, right?

				VASILI
		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

				GREER
		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

				MURPHY
		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

				GREER
		I must be in the wrong business.

				MURPHY
		You got that right.

				GREER
			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

				DODGE
		Much obliged, skipper.

	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

	AT A TABLE

	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

				GREER
		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

				DODGE
		With that coxswain dickhead.

				MURPHY
		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

				DODGE
		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

				DODGE
		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

				GIRLFRIEND
		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

				EPPS
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

				GIRLFRIEND
		This "guy" is my man, honey.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene --

				GIRLFRIEND
		You, shut up.

				EPPS
			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

				GIRLFRIEND
			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

				MURPHY
			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

				RIVETER
		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

				MURPHY
		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

				RIVETER
		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

				MURPHY
		I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
		ignore you. Epps, let's go.

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

				RIVETER
		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

				MURPHY
		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

				RIVETER
		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

				MURPHY
		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

				EPPS
		Morning everybody.

				GREER
		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

				EPPS
		Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
		that.

				GREER
		I bet you did.

				MURPHY
		Candy?

				EPPS
		It's my pen name.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

	Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
	the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

				GREER
		Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

				MURPHY
		Red sky in morning, sailor take 
		warning.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
	under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

				DODGE
		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

				EPPS
		One more?

				DODGE
		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

				DODGE
		What is your first name?

				EPPS
		What?

				DODGE
		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		What?

				EPPS
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		Maureen?

	She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

				EPPS
		What's yours?

	Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

				DODGE
		Roger.

				EPPS
		Roger?

				DODGE
		Yeah.

	She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

				DODGE
		You think that's funny

				EPPS
			(lying)
		No.

	She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT

	THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
	through a steady chop and a mild swell.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
	as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
	the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
	picks up a walkie-talkie.

				GREER
			(into walkie)
		Greer to Murphy.

	Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

				MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
		Yeah.

				GREER
		There's a large vessel out about ten 
		miles to the north-west.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
	radio.

				GREER
		I been watching it for close to an 
		hour and it hasn't moved. I can't 
		raise it on the radio either. Makes 
		me think it might be in trouble.

				MURPHY
		Alright. I'll be right up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

				MURPHY
		Too deep to anchor out there.

				GREER
		Looks like it's adrift.

				EPPS
		Could be a fishing boat.

				GREER
		Too big. More like a freighter.

				MURPHY
		What the hell would a freighter be

		miles.

				DODGE
		Smugglers maybe.

				GREER
		Smuggling what? Tundra grass?

	A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

				MURPHY

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

	Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

				MURPHY
		Alright. Back it off.

	Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

				MURPHY
		Hit the lights.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
	illuminating the water in front of the boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
	light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
	beam of light with a joy stick.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
	over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
	when a shadow looms into view.

				MURPHY
		Whoa, whoa.

	Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
	looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

	As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
	bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
	above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
	what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
	around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
	alleys.

				MURPHY
		"Chimera."

	Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

				MURPHY
		Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
	rising above it.

				MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
		This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

	The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy raises the mic again.

				MURPHY
		Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
		bow. Is there anyone aboard?

	They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
	glare of their lights.

				MURPHY
		Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
		tight.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
	crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
	the movement of the water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
	making their way up under the floodlights.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
	jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
	superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
	lending a still darker ominousness to it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
	as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
	seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
	apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
	light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
	here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

				GREER
			(into radio)
		Talk to me, skipper.

	After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

				MURPHY
		We're in a stairwell just under the 
		main superstructure.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

				MURPHY
		This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
		sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
		service for at least twenty years. 
		Probably a lot longer.

	They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
	takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
	revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
	equipment, a few pots still hanging.

	They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
	passageway.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge look on.

				MURPHY
		It's funny.

				GREER
		How's that?

				MURPHY
		Besides a little rust, everything's 
		pretty well-preserved.

	Greer and Dodge look at each other.

				MURPHY
		How she got out here is one hell of 
		a good question.
			(a long beat, then)
		Jesus.

	Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the 
	other end.

				GREER
		What is it?

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy.

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy, goddamit.

				MURPHY
			(finally)
		Sorry.

	Another beat in silence.

				GREER
		What is it?

	INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
	an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
		It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
		passenger ship.

	Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
	opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
	and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
	hanging over it all.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
	meet them at the bottom.

				MURPHY
			(jumping down)
		There's nobody on that boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

				DODGE
		Probably slipped her moorings, got 
		tangled up in a current.

				EPPS
		Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
		foot passenger liner drifted out of 
		Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
		bump into her until now?

				DODGE
		Somebody's probably looking for her 
		as we speak.

				MURPHY
		Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
		and abandoned. We've got every right 
		to salvage her.

				GREER
		You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
		thousand ton ship you're talking 
		about.

				MURPHY
		We've done it before.

				DODGE
		Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
		the other. But we got half the Bering 
		Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
		drag her over.

				MURPHY
		You have any idea how much a ship 
		like that could be worth in salvage? 
		The fittings alone could go for a 
		few million.

				DODGE
		If you get it back in one piece.

				MURPHY
		It's a risk I'm willing to take.

				GREER
		All we got to do is hit some rough 
		weather and you can forget about it.

				MURPHY
		So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
		A little weather couldn't be anything 
		she hasn't seen before.

				DODGE
		It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
		One boat can't control a ship that 
		size.

				MURPHY
		The damn thing's been floating around 
		for God knows how long and it hasn't 
		hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
		A little of the old push pull.

	A long beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
		check for a minute. You know I've 
		been good to you. But I'm prepared 
		to offer you something better now.
			(a beat)
		If we do this right, it's worth a 
		lot of money. A lot of money.

	They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

				EPPS
		Go on.

				MURPHY
		Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
		could come in around four million 
		bucks. At least. Who knows, could be 
		more. Could be a lot more.
			(a beat)
		What I'm proposing is... we split it 
		four ways.

	A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

				MURPHY
		Think about it. A million bucks a 
		piece.
			(a beat)
		You want to spend the rest of your 
		days drag-assing tank barges on the 
		gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's 
		get to work.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
	operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
	dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
	starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
	his face out from the other side.

				DODGE
		Ready?

				EPPS
		Bring it on, dude.

	Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
	a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
	the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
	the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
	it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

				EPPS
		OK.

	Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
	through the anchor alleys.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally)
		Hit it!

	Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
	cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
	hull with a shower of black rust.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
	cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
	alley.

	It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
	it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
	and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
	entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
	deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills 
	out of the anchor alley before Epps.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat 
	toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and 
	stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek 
	dangerously close to his face, until...

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor 
	alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A 
	beat as she holds there.

	Dodge lies tangled in the winch.

	Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down 
	into the water and come up again from the water to the tow 
	anchor on the tug's stern.

	walkie.

		More.

	The tug slows still more.

				MURPHY
		With a little extra fuel, weather

				DODGE
		Sounds reasonable.

		Looks like her last voyage was January

		she been since.

				EPPS
		She was sailing up north, right?

				MURPHY
		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

				EPPS
		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

				MURPHY
		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

				MURPHY
		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

				EPPS
		So what did happen?

				MURPHY
		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

				EPPS
		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

				MURPHY
		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

				EPPS
		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

				MURPHY
		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane 
	hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.  
	Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

				MURPHY
		What's this?

				DODGE
		Turbine rotor's shot.

				MURPHY
		I thought you said it was just a 
		blade.

				DODGE
		Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace 
		the whole deal.

				MURPHY
		How much longer's that gonna take?

				DODGE
		Like I always say --

				MURPHY
		I know I know, two ways to do anything --

				DODGE
		The right way and the wrong way.

				MURPHY
		But how long?

				DODGE
		Hard to say.

				MURPHY
		We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A 
		storm blows up and we're history.

				DODGE
		I'm telling you, you don't want to 
		be running that fan like it is.

				MURPHY
		What about running number two by 
		itself?

				DODGE
		It's a full 2500 horses down. We 
		couldn't drag that boat down hill on 
		ice with it.

				MURPHY
		How long, then?

				DODGE
		I gotta pull the blades and re-seat 
		everything in a new rotor -- .

				MURPHY
		How long?

				DODGE
		Three, four days.

				MURPHY
		Goddamit, Dodge.

				DODGE
		What do you want me to tell you, 
		that we can throw this sucker back 
		in and start pulling her like nothing 
		happened? Can't do it, skipper.

	A beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right.

	A beat as they hold there, thinking about it.

				MURPHY
		Obviously it's some kind of screw 
		up. The shipping records aren't a 
		hundred percent accurate.

				DODGE
		Man, it gives me the creeps. We got 
		no business towing a ship that size 
		anyway. I say we fix the turbines 
		and hit the highway.

				GREER
		Are you crazy? Do you realize we got 
		ourselves a ship? We own a ship, 
		Dodge.

				DODGE
		Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have 
		been lost at sea fifty years ago. 
		You don't think that's just a little 
		freaky?

				EPPS
		If this thing turns out to be a ship 
		everybody thought sank a long time

				DODGE
		Yeah, well how the hell you get 
		something like that wrong? That's a 
		damn big boat. It's either sunk or 
		it ain't.

				MURPHY
		We all want to get outa here, Dodge. 
		Especially me. With that boat in 
		tow. You got three days.  Make the

	A beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	A pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming 
	to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates 
	to Dubayy.

	Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows 
	the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz 
	into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as 
	he looks on at it.

	He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He 
	empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts 
	from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks 
	over the passenger manifest.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTERS QUARTERS - DAY

	Murphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last 
	night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of 
	the papers inside.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads 
	in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he 
	skins his knuckles.

				DODGE
		Fucker!

				GREER
		Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a 
		piece of metal.

				DODGE
			(inspecting his skinned 
			knuckles)
		Damn mind of it's own.

				GREER
			(seeing Murphy)
		Morning, skipper.

	Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight.

				MURPHY
		Morning.

				GREER
		You're up late.

				MURPHY
		Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. 
		Where's Epps?

				DODGE
		Went aboard.

				MURPHY
		She take a radio?

				GREER
		Yeah.

	Murphy nods. A beat.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

	Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
	and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
	windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
	walks on.

	A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
	decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
	reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
	lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
	And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
	SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
	instant it is there and gone.

	She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
	turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
	to be seen now.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares 
	into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps 
	steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered 
	about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK 
	CAN BE HEARD.

	A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the 
	sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the 
	TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
	doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
	coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
	is an ancient grandfather clock.

	All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
	but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

	Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the 
	TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces 
	her, now silent.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door 
	where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through 
	it.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port 
	holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming 
	pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating 
	bizarre patterns.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs 
	there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie 
	on the floor.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into

	INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment 
	circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine 
	ball.

	She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera 
	can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
	sea.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
	diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 
	4' stack of gold ingots.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		What the fuck we gonna do with it?

	Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

				GREER
		What the fuck you think we gonna do 
		with it? It's ours, baby. It's all 
		ours.

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

				GREER
		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

				MURPHY
			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

				GREER
		Ho, baby!

				EPPS
		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

				MURPHY
		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		It's a hell of a lot of money.

				DODGE
		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

				MURPHY
		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

				GREER
		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

				MURPHY
		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

				EPPS
		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

				MURPHY
		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

				GREER
		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

				EPPS
		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

				DODGE
			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

				MURPHY
		Then it happened before they scuttled 
		her.

				EPPS
		You mean, before she sank.

				GREER
		Cargo like this could make a crew 
		think twice.

				MURPHY
		That it could.

	A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
	galley table.

				GREER
		Then why didn't they take it.

				EPPS
		Probably didn't have time.

				DODGE
		Or somebody stopped them.

				MURPHY
		Either way, they must've had a pretty 
		good reason.

				GREER
		Must be a damn good reason to jump 
		ship and leave fifty million dollars 
		aboard.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

				MURPHY
		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

				DODGE
		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

				MURPHY
		It looks like it.

	A beat as they let this sink in.

				GREER
		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

				MURPHY
		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

				DODGE
		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty 
		million bucks?

				MURPHY
		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
		it is.

				GREER
		Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
		big piece of shit all the way back 
		to Sitka.

				MURPHY
		It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
		Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
		the salvage.

				EPPS
		Why not call for help?

				MURPHY
		For now the best thing we can do is 
		to keep quiet about this.

				DODGE
		Last thing we want is extra partners.

				EPPS
		Or uninvited guests.

				GREER
		I heard that.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

				MURPHY
		The sooner we get under way, the 
		sooner we are to spending what's 
		ours.

	Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum 
	fitting over one of the open turbines.

	Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space 
	beyond the twisted hatch.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one.
			(as Epps stacks the 
			last one)
		Two twenty two.

	Greer makes a note.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty two kilograms of 
		solid gold.

				EPPS
		That's what I call a payday.

				GREER
		Hell yeah.

	They slap hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door 
	marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
	dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
	windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
	ordered and in its place.

	Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
	it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
	drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
	protractor amidst other sundry items.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in 
	on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered 
	curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of 
	slippers lie beneath it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
	time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
	shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
	at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
	EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
	ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
	is tied.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
	from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
	the deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
	hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
	coming to the engine room door.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

				DODGE
			(over the roar)
		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

				DODGE
		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
	smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
	but the fire is out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
	leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

				DODGE
		One minute I'm minding my own 
		business, the next thing I know the 
		whole place is burning up.
			(taking a drag)
		An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
		welder. Started an oil fire.

				GREER
		Looks like it took out the backup 
		genny too.

				MURPHY
		Terrific.

	Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

				MURPHY
		How's that leg?

	Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

				DODGE
		Seen better -- Ow!

	Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

				EPPS
		This's gonna hurt a little.

				DODGE
		Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

	Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

				GREER
		What now?

				MURPHY
		We could call for help.

				GREER
		And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
		around here?

				EPPS
		What other choices have we got?

				DODGE
		I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
		be towing no ship now.

		Moving to Sweden.

				DODGE
		What's so great about Sweden?

				GREER
		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

				EPPS
		That's a good thing?

				GREER
		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder

				DODGE
		Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish

		We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

				MURPHY
		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be 
		doing if we don't get this boat 
		running.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah.

	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

				GREER
		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

				EPPS
		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

				DODGE
		Sounds like the hull.

				MURPHY
		Warm water current maybe, making the 
		metal expand.

				GREER
		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

	The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
	halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
	which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
	crumbling in her hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
	a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
	holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
	watch and fob, and a room key.

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
	folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
	holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
	presumably his wife.

	INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

				EPPS
		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

				EPPS
		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

				EPPS
		Did you see him?

				MURPHY
		Who?

				EPPS
		The guy. He just came this way.

				MURPHY
		What guy?

				EPPS
		There's somebody else on this boat.

				MURPHY
		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

				EPPS
		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

				MURPHY
		Are you sure?

				EPPS
		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

				MURPHY
		You sure it wasn't me?

				EPPS
		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

				DODGE
		Light in those passages ain't so 
		good.

				EPPS
		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

				GREER
		What'd he look like?

				EPPS
		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

				DODGE
		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

				GREER
		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

				EPPS
		Maybe that is his boat.

				DODGE
		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

				MURPHY
		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

				DODGE
		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

				MURPHY
		Not in the eyes of the law.

				EPPS
		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

				MURPHY
		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

				DODGE
		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

				MURPHY
		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

				DODGE
		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

				DODGE
		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

				EPPS
		So we kill him?

				DODGE
		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

				GREER
		I don't know.

				MURPHY
		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

				GREER
		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

				DODGE
		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

				EPPS
		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

				GREER
		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

				MURPHY
		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.
			(a beat)
		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

				DODGE
		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

				MURPHY
		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

				EPPS
		Guess that'd be me. Again.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

				GREER
		Pretty low all around.

				MURPHY
		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

				EPPS
		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

				MURPHY
		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

				DODGE
		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

				DODGE
		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

				EPPS
			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

				MURPHY
		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

				EPPS
		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

				GREER
		Coffee.

				EPPS
			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

				MURPHY
		Got your light?

				EPPS
		Yup.

				DODGE
		Smokes?

				EPPS
		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

				EPPS
		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

				MURPHY
		You just shoot at something?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

				GREER (O.S.)
		Ho-ly shit.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

				MURPHY
		Bodies're too fresh.

				DODGE
		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

				MURPHY
		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

				GREER
		And look what happened.

				DODGE
		Damn barbaric is what it is.

				MURPHY
		Could be meant as a warning.

				GREER
		Stay away. Or else.

				EPPS
		Because of the gold.

				MURPHY
		That'd be my guess.

				DODGE
		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

				GREER
		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

				MURPHY
		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

				EPPS
		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				DODGE
		Let's not be too hasty.

				GREER
		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
	turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
	smoke.

				DODGE
		All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

				MURPHY
		Can't you use something else?

				DODGE
		I might be able to find something on 
		the ship. But it's gonna take time.

				MURPHY
		Do what you need to do. Just do it 
		fast.

				DODGE
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	Epps sleeps in her bunk.

	INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

	Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

				DODGE
		I need lag bolts, especially one 
		inch standard. And sheet metal.  
		Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
		of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
		do.

				GREER
		I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
		know.

				DODGE
		You find anything that even looks 
		like a compressor. I don't care what, 
		grab it.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

				GREER
		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

				GREER
		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

				GREER
		Dodge!

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
	Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
	vessel 'China Sea.'"

				MURPHY
		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
	SOS."

	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
	CLOSES AGAIN.

	Murphy takes the radio.

				MURPHY
		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

				VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know, but won't say so."

	Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
	someone were there but not speaking.

				MURPHY
		Who is this!!

	The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
	Murphy squeezes the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer! Dodge!

	Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
	CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
	sounds.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(taking radio)
		Murphy.

				DODGE
		You better get down here quick, 
		skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		I think you better see this for 
		yourself.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
	Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
	from the open door as he approaches.

	AT CABIN 400

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

				DODGE
		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

				GREER

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

	As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Hard to say.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

				EPPS
		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

				DODGE
		A what?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

				DODGE
		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

				MURPHY
		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

				EPPS
		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

				DODGE
		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

				EPPS
		Greer?

				MURPHY
		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

				MURPHY
		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

				DODGE
		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

				EPPS
			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

				MURPHY
		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo

			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States

	Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

				MURPHY

		Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. 
		This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic 
		Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey

	Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
	comes open and Murphy steps in.

				MURPHY
		How's he doing?

				EPPS
		Same. Any luck?

				MURPHY
		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

				EPPS
			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
		SOS.

				MURPHY
		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

				DODGE
			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

				MURPHY
		If they knew what they were carrying.

				EPPS
		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

				MURPHY
		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

				EPPS
		Only something must've gone wrong.

				DODGE
		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

				MURPHY
		How do you mean?

				DODGE
		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

				MURPHY
		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

				MURPHY
		What do you propose?

				DODGE
		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

				MURPHY
		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

				DODGE
		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

				MURPHY
		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

				MURPHY
		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

				DODGE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

				MURPHY
		I think you know.

				DODGE
		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

				MURPHY
		The radio!

				DODGE
			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

				DODGE
		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

				MURPHY
		You smashed it!

				DODGE
		What?!

				MURPHY
		Don't lie to me!

				DODGE
		What the fuck -- ?

				MURPHY
		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Conveniently enough for you.

				DODGE
		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

				DODGE
		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

				EPPS
		It's Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

				GREER
		Never been more thirsty in my life.

				MURPHY
		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

				MURPHY
		How're you feeling?

				GREER
		Lost my sea legs.

				EPPS
		Any dizziness?

				GREER
		No.

				EPPS
		Headache, nausea, lights?

				GREER
		Lights?

				EPPS
		Sudden flashes of light.

				GREER
		I feel fine.

				DODGE
		What day is it?

				GREER
		I don't know. Tuesday?

				DODGE
		Wrong. It's Friday.

				EPPS
		Try Wednesday.

				DODGE
		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

				GREER
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		You don't remember?

				GREER
		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

				MURPHY
		You've been out for about a day.

				GREER
		Say what?

				MURPHY
		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

				GREER
		Oh, man.

				MURPHY
		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

				GREER
		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

				MURPHY
		The ah... the radio's out.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		Smashed it up pretty bad.

				EPPS
		But, who -- ?

				DODGE
		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

				EPPS
		Did you?

				DODGE
		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

	WITH EPPS

	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

				EPPS
		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

				EPPS
		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

				EPPS
		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

				MURPHY
		February first.

				EPPS
		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

				MURPHY
		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

				EPPS
		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

				MURPHY
		Collision? With what?

				EPPS
		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

				MURPHY
		But where's the damage?

				EPPS
		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

				MURPHY
		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Yeah.

				DODGE
		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

				MURPHY
		What the hell happened!

				DODGE
		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

				GREER
		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

				MURPHY
		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

				MURPHY
		Dodge!

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

	WITH DODGE

	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

	WITH DODGE

	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

	WITH DODGE

	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

	WITH DODGE

	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

				GREER
		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

				GREER
		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

				MURPHY
		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

				EPPS
		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

				MURPHY
		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

				DODGE
		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

				GREER
		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

				DODGE
		The turbine blew.

				GREER
		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

				MURPHY
			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

				GREER
		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

				MURPHY
		Shut up.

				GREER
		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

				MURPHY
		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

				MURPHY
		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

	A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

				MURPHY
		So just stow it. You understand?
			(a beat)
		We don't need this right now.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
	sit around it in silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
	as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
	under it. She sits down, trying it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

				DODGE
		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

				DODGE
		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

				MURPHY
		If money can buy what he wants.

				DODGE
		I don't figure there's much I want 
		money can't buy.

				MURPHY
		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

				MURPHY
		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

				DODGE
		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
	top deck.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
	broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

	INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

	Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
	scavenging for food.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

				GIRL
		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

				GIRL
		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

				EPPS
		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

				EPPS
		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

				EPPS
		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

				EPPS
		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

				DODGE
		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

				GREER
		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

				MURPHY
		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

				DODGE
		There's a charming thought.

				GREER
		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

				DODGE
		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

				EPPS
			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

				GREER
		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

				GREER
		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

				MURPHY
		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

	WITH GREER AND MURPHY

	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

				MURPHY
		It's a Noaa buoy.

				GREER
		A what?

				MURPHY
		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

				MURPHY
		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

	ON THE BUOY

	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy corrects.

				EPPS
		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

	ON THE BUOY

	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy yanks on the line.

	ON THE BUOY

	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

	ON THE BUOY

	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

				GREER
		We're still drifting.

				MURPHY
		The mooring hasn't come taught.

				EPPS
		It's not gonna hold us.

				MURPHY
		Doesn't matter.

	ON THE BUOY

	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

				DODGE
		No fucking way.

	ON THE BUOY

	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

				MURPHY
		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

				EPPS
		Hey.

				MURPHY
		Hey.

				EPPS
		Couldn't sleep.

				MURPHY
		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

				EPPS
		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

				MURPHY
		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

				EPPS
		The what?

				MURPHY
		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

				EPPS
		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

				MURPHY
		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

				EPPS
		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

				MURPHY
		Not our mystery guest again.

				EPPS
		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

				MURPHY
		What, like some kind of ghost?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

				EPPS
		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

				EPPS
		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

				MURPHY
		Showing you what?

				EPPS
		What happened.

				MURPHY
		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

				EPPS
		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

				MURPHY
		Victims of what?

				EPPS
		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

				MURPHY
		That much I think we've already 
		established.

				EPPS
		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

				EPPS
		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

				MURPHY
		What's that supposed to mean?

				EPPS
		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

				MURPHY
		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

				EPPS
		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

				MURPHY
		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

				MURPHY
		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

				MURPHY
		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

				MURPHY
		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

				EPPS
		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally, from inside)
		What?

				EPPS
		Get up.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

				MURPHY
		You're late.

				DODGE
		Sorry.

				MURPHY
			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

				DODGE
			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

				DODGE
		Dodge.

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

				DODGE
		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
	THE RADIO:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

				DODGE
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

				DODGE
		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
		.

	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

	ON SHOTGUN

	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

				MURPHY
		Dodge?

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps shines her light on something.

				EPPS
		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

				GREER
		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

				EPPS
		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

				MURPHY
		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

				MURPHY
		He took the shotgun and a light.

				GREER
		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
			(into radio)
		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Epps? You there?

				EPPS
		Right here.

	WITH MURPHY

	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

	WITH GREER

	As Greer moves along too.

				GREER
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

				GREER
		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

				GREER
		You okay?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

				GREER
		What?

				EPPS
		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

	MOVING WITH EPPS

	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

	WITH THE LIGHT

	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

				GREER
		Can't find the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

				GREER
		Doesn't look like it much matters.

				EPPS
		What do we do with him?

				MURPHY
		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

				GREER
		What about the gold?

				MURPHY
		Leave it.

				GREER
		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

				MURPHY
		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

				GREER
		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

				EPPS
		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

				GREER
		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

				MURPHY
		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

				GREER
		Fine with me.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

	AT THE TABLE

	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

				EPPS
		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

				EPPS
		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

				EPPS
		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

				EPPS
		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

				EPPS
			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	CUT TO BLACK

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	OUTSIDE

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

				MURPHY (V.O.)
		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

				MURPHY
		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

				MURPHY
		What do you think?

				EPPS
		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like 
		wild dogs."

				MURPHY
		Over the gold.

				EPPS
		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

				EPPS
		They went crazy.

				MURPHY
		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
	and Murphy stand over it.

				MURPHY
		We lash a few of these together it 
		might get us far enough into the 
		shipping lanes to be rescued.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

				MURPHY
		Hard to say which is worse, staying 
		here or taking our chances in open 
		water.

				EPPS
		If the weather holds it might not be 
		so bad.

				MURPHY
		It's not the weather I'm worried 
		about. The wrong current could drag 
		us as far as the Aleutians before we 
		come across another boat.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
	a single usable raft.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

	Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
	light from the skylight falling on him from above.

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

				EPPS
			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

				EPPS
		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
	RADIO.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
	THE CORRIDOR.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

				THE GIRL
		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

				FATHER
		What do you think?

				MOTHER
		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

				FATHER
		I thought this was all the rage.

				KATIE
		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

				FATHER
		What about this year?

				KATIE
		It's not your color anyway.

				GIRL
		I like it, daddy.

				FATHER
		Well thank you!

				GIRL
		Daddy, how much longer before we 
		start moving again?

				FATHER
		They're working on the engines, honey. 
		As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
		our way.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

	EPPS' POV

	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

				MUTINEER
		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

				EPPS (V.O.)
		NO!!!!

	BACK TO SCENE

	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

				KATIE
		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

				KATIE
		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

				MURPHY
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

				EPPS
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
	mine field for a drifting ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

				EPPS
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		We hit land.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		We're in an island chain. It's only 
		a matter of time before we hit another 
		one.

				EPPS
		Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
		tank.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

	AT THE OTHER END

	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

				EPPS
		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

				MURPHY
		Let's get the hell out of here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

				MURPHY
		It should be enough to get us to one 
		of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

				MURPHY
		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

	AT THE STANDS

	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

				MURPHY
		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

				EPPS
		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

				EPPS
		You killed them.

				MURPHY
		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

				EPPS
		So you killed them?

				MURPHY
		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

				EPPS
		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

				MURPHY
		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

				EPPS
		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

				MURPHY
		I think I see it pretty well.

				EPPS
		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

				MURPHY
		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

				EPPS
		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

				MURPHY
		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

				EPPS
		I don't give a damn about the gold.

				MURPHY
		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
	rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

				MURPHY
		There's no reason to make this any 
		more difficult than it has to be.

	WITH EPPS

	As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
	herself up and climbs inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
	width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
	where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
	it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
	passageway.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

	AT THE BOTTOM

	Epps gets up, runs.

	WITH MURPHY

	Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

	INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
	GROWS STILL LOUDER.

	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
	rock promontory of a small island.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
	water pouring in behind it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
	huge gash rising on its port side.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
	through the breach.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
	of the passage. He begins backing away.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
	half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
	EXERTION.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
	compartment.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
	the bulkhead.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
	Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
	his pockets.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
	trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

	ABOVE THE WATER

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps collapses on the rocks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

	FADE TO BLACK

EXT.  MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY

A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty
prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DAY

A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full
bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The

building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to
notice.

						DANA
				 (exasperated)
			Frank, do you think you could give me a hand
			with these bags?

						FRANK
			I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a
			building superintendent.

						DANA
			You're also a human being, Frank.

						FRANK
				 (reluctantly going to help)
			Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the
			hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the
			grocery bags from her.

						DANA
				 (setting the wheel brakes on
				 the buggy)
			Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this
			eventually.

She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and
makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.

						FRANK
				 (to the baby)
			Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?

						FRANK
				 (to Dana)
			That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.
			Barrett.

						DANA
				 (finding her keys)
			Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to
			fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you
			last week.

						FRANK
			Didn't I do it?

BABY BUGGY

It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

He GURGLES with delight at the movement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY

Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.

						DANA
			No, you didn't, Frank.

						FRANK
			Okay, that's no problem.

						DANA
			That's exactly what you said last week.

BUGGY WHEELS

The brakes unlock themselves.

DANA

She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward
just out of her reach and stops.  Surprised by the movement, she reaches
for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even
further.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.

SIDEWALK

Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians
for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked.

INTERSECTION

Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner.

DANA

She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.

BUGGY

It careens toward the corner.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

Its eyes are wide open with excitement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk.

BUS

The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the
intersection at high speed.

BUGGY

It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street.  The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches.

INTERSECTION

Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby.  She hugs it close, deeply
relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY

THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar "No Ghosts" symbol
and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the
Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the
Upper West Side.  RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding
shotgun.

EXT.  WEST 77TH STREET - DAY  (MOMENTS LATER)

The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump
out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the
house.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

A WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished
house.

						STANTZ
				 (all business)
			How many of them are there, ma'am?

						WOMAN
			Fourteen.  They're in the back.  I hope you can
			handle them.  It's been like a nightmare.

						WINSTON
			How big are they?

She holds her hand out indicating about four feet.

						WINSTON
				 (resolute)
			We'll do our best, ma'am.

						WOMAN
			They're right out here.

She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.
Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.

						STANTZ
			Ready?

						WINSTON
			I'm ready.

						STANTZ
			Then let's do it.

He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS
between the ages of seven and ten.

						KIDS
				 (disappointed)
			Ghostbusters!!  Boooo!!

Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the
room is strewn with discarded toys and games.  A couple of weary parents
sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.

						WINSTON
				 (trying his best)
			How you doin', kids?

						LITTLE BOY
				 (nasty)
			I though we were having He-Man.

						STANTZ
			He-Man couldn't make it today.  That's why
			we're here.

						BOY
			My dad says you're full of crap.

						STANTZ
				 (stopped cold)
			Well, a lot of people have trouble believing

They get in the car

INT.  ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.

						WINSTON
			Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past.
			Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year
			these kids won't even remember who we are.

						STANTZ
				 (tries to start the car again)
			Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we
			did for this city.

						WINSTON
			Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job
			we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow
			man and blew the top three floors off an uptown
			highrise.

						STANTZ
			Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a
			hamburger without chopping up a cow.

He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and
CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits
of metal onto the pavement.  Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies.  Frustrated, Stantz
bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel

INT.  WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)

A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,
Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and
we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter
Venkman."  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster.

VENKMAN

He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,
understated and intimate.

						VENKMAN
			Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'
			I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,
			author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton
			Anglund.
				 (to his guest)
			Milt, your new book is called The End of the
			World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about
			gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you
			think anybody wants to read a book about it?

						MILTON
			Well, I think it's important for people to know
			that the world is in danger.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to
			happen or do we have to buy the book?

						MILTON
			I predict that the world will end at the
			stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

						VENKMAN
			This year?  That's cutting it a little close,
			isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of
			view, the book just came out, right?  So you're
			not even looking at the paperback release for
			maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least
			another year after that if the thing has
			movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.
			You would have been better off predicting 1992
			or even '94 just to be safe.

						MILTON
				 (irritated)
			This is not just some money-making scheme!  I
			didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong
			psychic belief that the world will end on New
			Year's Eve.

						VENKMAN
				 (placating)
			Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But
			I think my other guest may disagree with you.
			Elaine, you had another date in mind?

The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey
housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.

						ELAINE
			According to my sources, the world will end
			on February 14, in the year 2016.

						VENKMAN
			Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer.
			Where did you get that date, Elaine?

						ELAINE
			I received this information from an alien.  I
			was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having
			a drink in the bar when he approached me and
			started talking.  Then he must have used some
			sort of ray or a mind control device because
			he made me follow him to his room and that's
			where he told me about the end of the world.

						VENKMAN
			Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?

						ELAINE
			It may have been a room on the spacecraft made
			up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I
			can't be sure, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (humoring her)
			No, you can't, and I think that's the whole
			problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
			You may get some nice ones occasionally like
			Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to
			be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just
			about out of time.
				 (does his wrap-up right TO
				 the CAMERA)
			Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless
			pets.
				 (holds up a hairless cat)
			Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
				 (puts a finger to his temple
				 and sends out a though to his
				 viewers)
			... Good night.

INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)

Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a
well-meaning young incompetent.

						VENKMAN
			Where do you find these people?  I thought
			we were having the telekinetic guy who bends
			the spoons?

						NORMAN
			A lot of the better psychics won't come on the
			show.  They think you're too skeptical.

						VENKMAN
			Skeptical!  Norman, I'm a pushover.  I think
			professional wrestling is real.

There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Norman)
			What's all this?

						NORMAN
			They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'

						VENKMAN
			The Mayor!  He's a friend of mine.

Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK
HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.

						VENKMAN
				 (calling to the Mayor)
			Lenny!

The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know
him.

						VENKMAN
				 (starts to follow him)
			Lenny!  It's Pete Venkman!

The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkman's chest.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (snide)
			Can I help you?

						VENKMAN
				 (dangerous)
			Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.

						HARDEMEYER
			I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant.
			What can I do for you?

						VENKMAN
			I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just
			want to say hello to him.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (scornful)
			I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting
			any ghosts lately?

						VENKMAN
			No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor
			about.  We did a little job for the city a
			while back and we ended up getting sued,
			screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (bristling)
			Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall,
			barring a disaster, he's going to be elected
			governor of this state and the last thing we
			need is for him to be associated with two-bit
			frauds and publicity hounds like you and your
			friends.  You read me?

Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, I get it.  But I want you to tell Lenny
			that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.

EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors.  Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)

We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence.  Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit
by large skylights in the ceiling.  Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the
department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy.  Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana.

DANA

She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy.  Janosz
watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder.

						JANOSZ
				 (with an East European accent)
			Still working on the Turner?

Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.

						DANA
			Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,
			Janosz.

						JANOSZ
			You know, you are really doing very good work
			here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist
			me in some of the more important restorations.

						DANA
			Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here,
			but now that my baby's a little older, I was
			hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

VIGO PAINTING

At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his
head and looks at Dana.

JANOSZ AND DANA

Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.

						JANOSZ
				 (disappointed)
			We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I
			could take you to lunch today?

						DANA
			Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have
			an appointment.
				 (looks at her watch)
			In fact, I'd better go.

She starts gathering up her things.

						JANOSZ
			Every day I ask you, and every day you've got
			something else to do.  Do I have bad breath
			or something?

						DANA
				 (trying to brush him off)
			I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.

						JANOSZ
			Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.

						JANOSZ
				 (to himself)
			I think she likes me.

He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the
phrases as he resumes working.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.  A sign
identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research."

INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)

Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly
intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an
experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom
are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.  The device he is testing is a black
box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic
displays.

						DANA
			... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
			dead in the middle of the street

						SPENGLER

			Did anyone else see this happen?

						DANA
			Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't
			imagine this.

						SPENGLER
			I'm not saying you did.  In science we always
			look for the simplest explanation.

An ASSISTANT interrupts.

						ASSISTANT
			We're ready, Dr. Spengler

						SPENGLER
				 (to the Assistant)
			We'll start with the negative calibration.

He picks up the device and prepares to test it.

						DANA
				 (curious)
			What are you working on, Egon?

						SPENGLER
			I'm trying to determine whether human
			emotional states have a measurable effect on
			the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a
			theory Ray and I were working on when we had
			to dissolve Ghostbusters.

An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually
a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room.  Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated
arguement.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Dana)
			They think they're here for marriage
			counseling.  We've kept them waiting for two
			hours and we've been gradually increasing the
			temperature in the room.
				 (checking a heat sensor)
			It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.  Now my
			assistant is going to enter and ask them if
			they'd mind waiting another half-hour.

As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the
waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay.  They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass.  After recording his readings, he returns to his
Assistant.

						SPENGLER
			We'll do the happiness index next.
				 (to Dana)
			I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
			it's all right with you.

						DANA
			Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

						SPENGLER
			Oh no.

						DANA
				 (affectedly casual)
			Do you ever see him?

						SPENGLER
			Occasionally

						DANA
			How is he these days?

						SPENGLER
			Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a
			while there.  Then he crossed the border.

						DANA
			Does he ever mention me?

						SPENGLER
			No.  Not that I can recall.

They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.

						DANA
				 (slightly disappointed)
			Well, we didn't part on very good terms and
			we sort of lost track of each other when I
			got married.

The Assistant interrupts again.

						ASSISTANT
			We're ready for the affection test.

						SPENGLER
				 (to the assistant)
			Good.  Send in the puppy.

						DANA
				 (continuing)
			I thought of calling him after my marriage
			ended, but --.  Anyway, I appreciate you're
			doing this, Egon

They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.  Spengler monitors
her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.

						DANA
				 (handing him a card)
			This is my address and telephone number.
			Will you call me?

						SPENGLER
			Certainly.

						DANA
			Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of
			this to Peter if you don't mind.

						SPENGLER
			I won't.

						DANA
			Thank you.

She shakes his hand and exits.

						SPENGLER
				 (to his assistant)
			Now let's see how she reacts when we take
			away the puppy

EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)

It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village.  The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.

						STANTZ
				 (v.o., answering the phone)
			Ray's Occult.

INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS

The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan
sweater over a T-shirt.  He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews
on a battered, reeking pipe.  As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup
of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.

						STANTZ
				 (on the phone)
			Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What
			have I got?  I've got alchemy, astrology,
			apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon
			intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic
			surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie
			sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've
			got it all -- what are you looking for? ...
			Don't have any.  Try the stockyards.

He hangs up.

						SPENGLER
			Who was that?

						STANTZ
			Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come
			up with anything?

						SPENGLER
				 (referring to the book)
			This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a
			flower cart took off by itself and rolled
			approximately half a kilometer over level
			ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.

						STANTZ
			You might want to check those Duke University
			mean averaging studies on controlled
			psychokinesis.

						SPENGLER
				 (going to the stacks)
			Good idea.

The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm
			looking for an aerosol love potion I could
			spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would
			make her unconditionally submit to an unusual
			personal request.

						STANTZ
			Oh, hiya, Pete.

						VENKMAN
			So, no goat hooves, huh?

						STANTZ
				 (strung)
			I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's
			up?  How's it going?

						VENKMAN
			Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and
			buy me a sub?

						STANTZ
				 (slightly evasive)
			Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.

Spengler steps out of the stacks.

						VENKMAN
			Egon!

						SPENGLER
			Hello, Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet
			those science chicks really dig that big
			cranium of yours, huh?

						SPENGLER
			I think they're more interested in my
			epididymis.

						VENKMAN
			I don't even want to know where that is.

Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.

						STANTZ
			Oh, your book came in, Venkman.  Magical
			Paths to Fortune and Power.

He hands Venkman the book.

						VENKMAN
			Great.
				 (reading the contents)
			So what are you guys working on?

						STANTZ
			Oh, just checking something for an old friend.

						VENKMAN
			Who?

						STANTZ

			Who?  Just -- someone we know.

						STANTZ
			Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!

						VENKMAN
			Hi, Dana.

Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.

She regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his
presumptuousness.

						DANA
			Hello, Peter.

						VENKMAN

			You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you
			didn't call me first.  I'm still into all

						DANA
			I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.

			I can see that you're still very bitter about

Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on
the baby and the immediate physical environment.

VENKMAN AND DANA

Venkman starts nosing around the apartment.  Dana follows him.

						VENKMAN
			So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he
			ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.

						DANA
			He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems,
			he got a good offer from an orchestra in
			England and he took it.

						VENKMAN
			He ditched you.  You should've married me,
			you know.

						DANA
			You never asked me, and every time I brought
			it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.

						VENKMAN
			Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to
			feel loved and desired, too.

						DANA
			Well, when you started introducing me as "the
			old ball and chain," that's when I left.

						VENKMAN
			I may have a few personal problems but one thing
			I am is a total professional.

He leaves her and crosses to Spengler.

SPENGLER

He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby
with a tape measure and calipers.

						VENKMAN
			What are you going to do, Egon?  Knit him a
			snowsuit?

Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.

						SPENGLER
			I'd like to have a stool specimen

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or
			professional reasons?

						VENKMAN
				 (picking up the baby)
			Okay, kid.  Up you go.

He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing
his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking
him.

						VENKMAN
			Help!  Please somebody help me!  Get him off!
			Quickly!  He's gone completely berserk!

Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.

						DANA
			What do you think?

						VENKMAN
			There's no doubt about it.  He's got his
			father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely
			ugly.  And smelly.
				 (resumes playing with the baby)
			You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the
			stinkiest baby I ever smelled.
				 (to Dana)
			What's his name?

						DANA
			His name is Oscar.

						VENKMAN
			Oscar!  You poor kid!

						DANA
				 (losing patience)
			Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you
			think there's anything unusual about him.

						VENKMAN
			Unusual?
				 (holds up the baby and
				 scrutinizes him)
			I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of
			experience with babies.

He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper
off.

						DANA

			I'll do it.

				 (to Dana, nostalgic)
			Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't

			There's our old cash machine.  And the dry

				 tear)
			We really had some good times, didn't we?

						DANA
			We definitely had a moment or two.

Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.

						DANA
			That's where the buggy stopped.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, let's take a look.

Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill.  Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.

						STANTZ
				 (reading the PKE meter)
			Is this the spot?

						DANA
			A little to the left.  Right there!  That's
			where it stopped.

Stantz reads the PKE meter.

						STANTZ
			Nothing.  Not a trace.

						SPENGLER
			Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

						VENKMAN
			What's that?

						STANTZ
			Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
			measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
			giga electron volts.

						SPENGLER
			That's a thousand million electron volts.

						VENKMAN
			I knew that.

Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the
lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING
WILDLY.

						STANTZ
			I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's
			something brewing under the street.

						DANA
				 (worried, to Venkman)
			Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic
			problem or something that makes me vulnerable
			to these supernatural things.

						VENKMAN
			You mean like the time you got possessed and
			turned into a monster terror dog?  No, not
			a chance.  Total coincidence.

Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the
street.  Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is
lit by strong work lights.

POLICE CAR

It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift
worksite and stops.  The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler
doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.

						FIRST COP
			How ya doing?

						SPENGLER
				 (reeking with guilt)
			Fine!  It's cutting fine now.

						FIRST COP
				 (curious)
			Why are you cutting?

						SPENGLER
				 (looking for one of the
				 others)
			Why are we cutting?  Uh - boss!

Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a
good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.

						FIRST COP
			What are you doing here?

						VENKMAN
				 (belligerent)
			What the hell's it look like we're doing?
			We're bustin out asses over here 'cause
			some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'
			better to do than make idiots like us work
			late on a Friday night, right?
				 (looks to Spengler for
				 agreement)

						SPENGLER
				 (with a "right on" fist)
			Yo.

The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.

						FIRST COP
			Okay, boys, take it easy.

They drive off.  Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders.

						SPENGLER
			You were supposed to help me with this.

						VENKMAN
			You need the exercise.

Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole.  Suddenly he hits metal.  They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.

						STANTZ
				 (examing it)
			NYPRR.  What the hell -- ?  Help me lift
			this.

They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss.

						STANTZ
				 (shining a flashlight into
				 the hole)
			Wow!  It's an old airshaft.  It just goes
			forever.

Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.

						SPENGLER
			Very intense.  We need a deeper reading.
			Somebody has to go down there.

Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.

						STANTZ
			Thanks, boys.

They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong
cable attached to a winch.  Ray calls out orders to them as he descends
deeper and deeper.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				 (his voice echoing in the
				 airshaft)
			Keep going -- more -- more --

INT.  HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent
in total darkness.

						STANTZ
				 (using a radio now)
			Lower -- lower --
				 (to himself)
			Gee, this really is deep.

Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts)
			Hold it!  Steady!

He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into
the tunnel below.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - NIGHT

He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with
rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled
Art Nouveau mosaics.  A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE
STATION.

STANTZ

He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,
and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.

						STANTZ
				 (reverently)
			This is it, boys, the end of the line.  Van
			Horne Station.  The old New York Pneumatic.
			It's still here.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.

						SPENGLER
				 (explaining)
			The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an
			experimental subway system.  Fan-forced
			air-trains, built around 1870.

						STANTZ
				 (over the walkie-talkie)
			This is about as deep as you can go under
			Manhattan without digging your own hole.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Stantz)
			What's the reading?

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely
high reading.

						STANTZ
				 (on the radio)
			Off the top of the scale.  This place is
			really hot.  Lower me to the floor.

As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight
down the wall of the station, then onto the floor.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts)
			Hold it!!  Stop!!  Whoa!!

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable
torrent of disgusting ooze.

As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely
amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in
the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING
through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,
and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain
-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad
and eerie symphony.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT

						STANTZ
				 (ranting on the radio)
			Oh, my God!  It's a seething, bubbling,
			psychic cess!  Interlocked tubes of plasm,
			crackling with negative GEVs!  It's glowing
			and moving!  It's -- it's a river of slime!!

STANTZ

He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he
can.  He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on
it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting
the pole.

SLIME

Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of
the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet.  He jerks his legs up
as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.

						STANTZ
				 (on the radio)
			Haul me up, Venkman!  Now!

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's
car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier.  A
burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two
cops.

						SUPERVISOR
				 (no nonsense)
			Okay, what's the story here?

Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the
belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex
hardhat.

						VENKMAN
			What, I got time for this?  We got three
			thousand phones out in the Village and about
			eight million miles of cable to check.

						SUPERVISOR
				 (not buying it)
			The phone lines are over there.
				 (points to the curb)

Venkman pops Spengler on the head.

						VENKMAN
			I told ya!

Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				 (filtered)
			Help!  Help!  Pull me up!  It's alive!  It's
			eating my boots.

Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie.

						FIRST COP
			You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.
			We checked.  Tell me another one.

Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.

						VENKMAN
			Gas leak?

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME

Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which
is now bubbling up the shaft after him.

						STANTZ
				 (shouting)
			Get me out of here!!

Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old,
rusting conduit.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping
through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright
FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT

One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the
buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks
out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
			Sorry.

INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over
the living room.  Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for
information about the blackout.  She listens to a special news report
for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door
and looks in.  Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz
standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of
the hallway.  He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.

						DANA
				 (surprised)
			Janosz?

						JANOSZ
			Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the
			neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to
			see if everything's all right with you --
			you know, with the blackout and everything?
			Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?

His affected concern is chilling.  She is frightened but conceals it
from him.

						DANA
				 (mechanically and cautiously)
	We're fine, Janosz.

He tires to look around her into the apartment.

						JANOSZ
			Do you need anything?  You want me to come
			in?

						DANA
			No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks
			anyway.

						JANOSZ
			Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night,
			Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs
			bite you.

						DANA
			Good night, Janosz.

She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there
staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.

INT.  HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like
headlights and he walks off down the hall.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY

The JUDGE, a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the
court to order.

						JUDGE
			I want to make one thing very clear before
			we go any further.  The law does not recognize
			the existence of ghosts, and I don't believe
			in them either, so I don't want to hear a
			lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and
			demons.  We're going to stick to the facts
			in this case and save the ghost stories for
			the kiddies.  Understood?

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler.

						STANTZ
			Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?

						SPENGLER
			His nickname is "The Hammer."

Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney LOUIS TULLY, lawyer,
CPA and former demonic possession victim.  Louis is desperately paging
through a mountain of legal textbooks.

						LOUIS
				 (nervous)
			I think you're making a big mistake here,
			fellas.  I do mostly tax law and some probate
			stuff occasionally.  I got my law degree at
			night school.

						STANTZ
			That's all right.  We got arrested at night.

SPECTATORS' GALLERY

Venkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.

						DANA
			I wish I could stay.  I feel personally
			responsible for you being here.

						VENKMAN
			You are personally responsible.  If I can
			get conjugal rights, will you visit me at
			Sing Sing?

						DANA
			Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.

						VENKMAN
			Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.

						DANA
			You mean you cough up hairballs all over
			the rug?

						VENKMAN
			I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.

						DANA
				 (sincerely)
			Good luck.

						VENKMAN
			Thanks.

She gives him a quick, unexpected kiss and exits.  Venkman savors it for
a moment then goes back to the defense table.

PROSECUTION TABLE

Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's principal aide, is goading the PROSECUTOR,
a very sober, humorless woman in her late thirties.

						HARDEMEYER
			How are you doing, hon?  Just put these guys
			away fast and make sure they go away for a
			long, long time.

						PROSECUTOR
			It shouldn't be hard with this list of charges.

						HARDEMEYER
			Good.  Very good.  The mayor and future
			governor won't forget this.

He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table
on his way out of the courtroom.

DEFENSE TABLE

The Ghostbusters look up as Hardemeyer approaches.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (gloating)
			Nice going, Venkman.  Violating a judicial
			restraining order, willful destruction of
			public property, fraud, malicious mischief
			-- smooth move.  See you in a couple years
			-- at your first parole hearing.

Herdemeyer exits.  Louis looks devastated.

						LOUIS
			Gee, the whole city's against us.  I think
			I'm going to be sick.

Spengler hands him a waste basket as the Prosecutor calls her first
witness.

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - DAY (LATER)

The Con Ed Supervisor is testifying.

						PROSECUTOR
			Mr. Fianella, please look at Exhibits A
			through F on the table over there.  Do you
			recognize that equipment?

EXHIBIT TABLE

Lying on the table are the basic tools of the Ghostbusting trade: three
proton packs and particle throwers, a couple of ghost traps, and various
meters and detection devices.

						CON ED
				 (o.c.)
			That's the stuff the cops found in their
			truck.

WITNESS STAND

She continues.

						PROSECUTOR
			Do you know what this equipment is used for?

						CON ED
				 (shrugs)
			I don't know.  Catching ghosts, I guess.

						PROSECUTOR
				 (to the Judge)
			May I remind the court that the defendants
			are under a judicial restraining order that
			specifically forbids them from performing
			services as paranormal investigators and
			eliminators.

						JUDGE
			So noted.

						PROSECUTOR
			Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the
			substance in the jar on the table marked
			Exhibit F?

PROSECUTOR

She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the
slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel.

						CON ED
			I been working underground for Con Ed for
			27 years and I never saw anything like that
			in my life.  We checked out that tunnel the
			next day and we didn't find nothing.  If it
			was down there, they must have put it there.

DEFENSE TABLE

Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz.

						STANTZ
				 (defensively)
			Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have
			been ten thousand gallons of it down there.

						SPENGLER
			It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal
			source.

						LOUIS
				 (nervously)
			Should I say that?

						SPENGLER
			I doubt that they'd believe us.

Louis moans and goes back to his notes.

												 WIPE TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER

Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him.

						LOUIS
			So like you were just trying to help out
			your old friend because she was scared and
			you didn't really mean to do anything bad
			and you really love the city and won't ever
			do anything like this again, right?

						PROSECUTOR
			Objection, your Honor.  He's leading the
			witness.

						JUDGE
			The witness is leading him.  Sustained.

						LOUIS
			Okay, let me rephrase that question.
				 (to venkman)
			Didn't you once coach a basketball team for
			underprivileged children?

						VENKMAN
			Yes, I did.  We were city champs.

						PROSECUTOR
			Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

						JUDGE
			Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything
			to ask this witness that may have some
			bearing on this case?

						LOUIS
				 (to Venkman)
			Do I?

						VENKMAN
			No, I think you've helped them enough already.

						LOUIS
				 (to the Judge)
			No, I guess not.
				 (to the Prosecutor)
			Your witness.

The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.

						PROSECUTOR
			So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court
			why it is you and your co-defendants took it
			upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the
			middle of the street.

						VENKMAN
			Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many
			holes already we didn't think anyone would
			notice.

The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.

						JUDGE
			Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in
			contempt.

						VENKMAN
			Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets
			me up like that I can't resist.

						PROSECUTOR
			I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were
			you digging the hole?  And please remember
			that you're under oath.

						VENKMAN
			I had my fingers crossed when they swore me
			in, but I'm going to tell you the truth.
			There are things in this world that go way
			beyond human understanding, things that
			can't be explained and that most people don't
			want to know about anyway.  That's where we
			come in.

						PROSECUTOR
			So what are you saying?  That the world of
			the supernatural is your special province?

						VENKMAN
			No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens
			and somebody has to deal with it.

The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.

												 WIPE TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

The trial is nearing its end.  The Judge calls on Louis to make his
summation.

						JUDGE
			Does the counsel for the defense wish to
			make any final arguements?

Louis rises.

						LOUIS
			Your honor, may I approach the bench?

						JUDGE
				 (impatient)
			Yes.

Louis crosses to the judge's bench.

						LOUIS
				 (to the judge)
			Can I have some of your water?

						JUDGE
			Get on with it, counselor!

						LOUIS
				 (scared)
			Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --
				 (he remembers there's no
				 jury)
			audience.  I don't think it's fair to call
			my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was
			a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in
			an elevator for about three hours and I had
			to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I
			don't blame them because once I turned into
			a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.

He goes back to the defense table and sits down.  Stantz and Spengler
hang their heads.  Venkman pats Louis on the back.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Louis)
			Way to go.  Concise and to the point.

JUDGE

He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.

						JUDGE
			That's it?  That's all you have to say?

						LOUIS
			Did I forget something?

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.

						JUDGE
			That was unquestionably the worst
			presentation of a case I've ever heard in a
			court of law!  I ought to cite you for
			contempt and have you disbarred.  As for
			your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz
			and Egon Spengler, on the charges of
			conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction
			of public property, I find you guilty on all
			counts.  I order you to pay fines in the
			amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to
			eighteen months in the city correctional
			facility at Ryker's Island.

STANTZ

He sees the activity in the jar

						STANTZ
			Uh-oh, she's twitchin'.

THE BENCH

The Judge continues

						JUDGE
			And on a more personal note, let me go on
			record as saying that there is no place in
			decent society for fakes, charlatans and
			tricksters like you who prey on the
			gullibility of innocent people.  You're
			beneath the contempt of this court.  And
			believe me, if my hands were not tied by the
			unalterable fetters of the law, a law which
			has become in my view far too permissive and
			inadequate in it's standards of punishment,
			I would invoke the tradition of our
			illustrious forebearers, reach back to a
			sterner, purer justice and have you burned
			at the stake!

He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily.  Then
he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.

SPECIMEN JAR

The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz anticipates big trouble.

						STANTZ
			Under the table, boys!

The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.

LOUIS

He stands up and looks around fearfully.

INT.  COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY

Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases.  All eyes turn to the
exhibit table.  Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO
APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.

JUDGE

He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and
recognizes them immediately.

						JUDGE
				 (in horror)
			Oh, my God!  The Scoleri Brothers!

SCOLERI BROTHERS

Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten
feet tall.  They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are
metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still
attached.  Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their
bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to
get at the Judge.

JUDGE

Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense
table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the
spectral intruders.

						JUDGE
				 (terrified)
			You've got to do something!

						VENKMAN
			Who are they?

						JUDGE
			They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them
			for murder.  They were electrocuted up at
			Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.

						VENKMAN
			Maybe they just want to appeal.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.

PROSECUTOR

She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge
with them.

						VENKMAN
			These boys aren't playing around.

						JUDGE
				 (desperately)
			You've got to stop them.  Please!

						LOUIS
				 (thinking like a lawyer)
			Violating a judicial restraining order could
			expose my clients to serious criminal
			penalties.  As their attorney I'd have to
			advise them against it.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They start punching through the jury box.

JUDGE

He is just about hysterical with fear.

						JUDGE
			All right!  All right!  I'm recinding the
			order.  Case dismissed!!
				 (he pounds his gavel on
				 the floor)
			Now do something!

						STANTZ
			Let's go to work, boys.

With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were
being displayed as evidence.  They strap them on hastily as the Brothers
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.

						VENKMAN
				 (slinging the pack onto
				 his back)
			Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

						STANTZ
				 (grabbing other gear)
			Okay, let's heat 'em up!

They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle
throwers.

						STANTZ
			All right, throwers.  Set for full neutronas
			on stream.

They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts
them.

						VENKMAN
			Hey!  Why don't you pick on someone your own
			size?

The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot
lightning at their new adversaries.

						STANTZ
				 (to the others)
			On my signal, boys.  Open 'em up -- Now!

They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.

						VENKMAN
			Spengs, take the door.  Ray, let's try and
			work them down and into the corner.

Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the
streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on
the floor.

						STANTZ
			Watch it!  I'm coming under you, Pete.

They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while
ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers.  Finally, Ray
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of
light energy.

						STANTZ
			Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --
			Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him
			down -- trapping -- trapping -- now!

He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the
traps which snap shut.

INT.  COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY

LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a
ghost inside each trap.

						VENKMAN
				 (checking the trap)
			Occupado.

INT.  COURTROOM - JUDGE - DAY (AFTER GHOST BATTLE)

He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and
looks around in total amazement.

LOUIS

He crawls out from under a chair.  Reporters and spectators get back on
their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.

PROSECUTOR

She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.

						SPENGLER
				 (to the Prosecutor)
			Brilliant summation.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of
them standing in the wrecked courtroom.

						VENKMAN
			Case closed, boys.  We're back in business.

The spectators cheer and applaud.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted
into place over the main entrance.  It's just like the original "No
Ghosts" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding
up two fingers.  Venkman enters the firehouse.

INT.  BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT

A man and his wife are lying in bed reading.  The man is played by Louis
Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,
is playing his wife.  They are both terrible actors.  Suddenly, a ghost,
actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom.  Janine
sees it and screams.

						LOUIS
			What is it, honey?

						JANINE
			It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know
			what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us
			alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.

						LOUIS
			Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.

He picks up the phone.

						JANINE
			Who are you going to call?

						LOUIS
				 (with a wink)
			Ghostbusters.

As he starts to dial, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the Ghostbusters
standing in the bedroom.  Their acting isn't much better than Louis and
Janine's.

GHOSTBUSTERS

Stantz speaks directly TO the CAMERA.

						STANTZ
			I'm Ray --

						VENKMAN
			I'm Peter --

						SPENGLER
			I'm Egon --

						STANTZ
			And we're the ...

						ALL
				 (together)
			Ghostbusters.

						STANTZ
			That's right -- Ghostbusters.  We're back
			and we're better than ever with twice the
			know-how and twice the particle-power to
			deal with all your supernatural elimination
			needs.

During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g. pretending to trap the
fake ghost.

						STANTZ
			Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.
				 (TO CAMERA)
			And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're
			giving you twice the value with our special
			half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.

						VENKMAN
			Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone
			crazy?

						STANTZ
			I guess so, Pete, because that's not all.
			Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them,
waiting for his cue.

						SPENGLER
			You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage

INT.  JACK HARDEMEYER'S OFFICE - DAY

Hardemeyer is watching the Ghostbusters commercial on a TV in his office.
He bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches OFF the TV.

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER)

The garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out
onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING.  Louis comes
running out after it.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor.
He sniffs around, following the smell.

						LOUIS
			Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really
			big --

He freezes.

INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV

Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing
down Louis's bag lunch.  Slimer looks up and sees Louis.

SLIMER AND LOUIS

They both scream and run off in opposite directions.

SLIMER

He passes right through a wall and disappears.

LOUIS

He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry.

						LOUIS
				 (screaming)
			Help!  There's a thing!

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER)

Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog
along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.

GHOSTLY JOGGER

A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.

EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME)

Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the
newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.

STANTZ

He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging
track.

GHOST JOGGER

He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.  As the
ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit
concealed control buttons.  A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a
glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.

						VENKMAN
				 (checking his watch)
			You know he ran that last lap in under six
			minutes?

						STANTZ
			If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic
			prospect.

The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap
dime-store Santa Claus hats.

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - ORREFORS GLASS STORE - DAY

The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the
Ghostbusters enter the store.

INT.  ORREFORS GLASS STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the
glass shelves and display tables.  Stantz and Venkman are talking to the
manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices
positioned in each corner of the store.

On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which
throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store.  The manager
watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air,
SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.
There is a long pregnant pause.

						STANTZ
				 (to the manager)
			So will that be cash or a check?

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Everyone else has gone home.  Dana is cleaning her brushes and putting
her supplies away.

VIGO PAINTING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vigo turns his head and watches Dana as she walks past the painting.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area.  We PAN
DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a
ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk.  Hanging from strings over the desk
are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken.

WALL

Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the
chicken bait.  He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to
the chicken.

LOUIS

His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal.

						LOUIS
				 (shouts)
			Gotcha!

DESK

The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy.  Slimer
dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down
on Louis's desk.

						LOUIS
				 (seeing the damage)
			Uh-oh.

He slinks off, defeated.

INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - SECURITY DESK - DAY

The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable TV on the security
desk.  Rudy, the Security Guard, is reading a National Enquirer with a
giant front-page headline: GHOSTBUSTERS SAVE JUDGE.  Venkman enters.

						VENKMAN
			I'm looking for Dana Barrett.

						SECURITY GUARD
			Room 304 -- Restorations.
				 (recognizing him)
			Hey!  Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.'
			I'm a big, big fan.  That used to be one of
			my two favorite shows.

						VENKMAN
				 (flattered)
			Thanks.  What's the other one?

						SECURITY GUARD
			'Bass Masters.'  It's a fishing show.  Ever
			see it?

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, really great.  Take it easy.

He exits.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer.  Janosz is
at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo.
Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana.

						VENKMAN
				 (looking at the Ver Meer)
			So this is what you do, huh?

						DANA
				 (glad to see him)
			Oh, hello, Peter.

						VENKMAN
			You're really good, you know.

						DANA
			I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it.
			It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about
			ten million dollars.

VIGO

He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.

VENKMAN

Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life,
holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.

						VENKMAN
			You know you can go to Art World and get
			these huge sofa-size paintings for about
			forty-five bucks.

He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.

						DANA
			I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk
			about art.

						VENKMAN
			As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell
			you that I haven't forgotten your problem
			and that we're still on the case.

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.

						JANOSZ
				 (smiling at Venkman)
			Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to
			your friend?

						DANA
			Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman.
			Peter, Janosz Poha.

Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.

						JANOSZ
				 (avoiding his gaze)
			Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on
			television.

						VENKMAN
			How are you?
				 (looking over at the Vigo
				 painting)
			What's that you're working on, Johnny?

Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go.  Venkman and Dana cross to
the Vigo painting.  Janosz steps protectively in front of it.

						JANOSZ
			It's a painting I'm restoring for the new
			Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait
			of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled
			most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th
			Century.

						VENKMAN
				 (staring at the painting)
			Too bad for the Moldavians.

						JANOSZ
				 (defensive)

			He was a very powerful magician.  A genius
			in many ways and quite a skilled painter.

						DANA
			He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
			I hate this painting.  I've felt very
			uncomfortable since they brought it up from
			storage.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want
			to hang in the rec room.  You know what it
			needs?
				 (picking up a brush)
			A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.

						JANOSZ
				 (with forced good will)
			We don't go around altering valuable
			paintings, Dr. Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			Well, I'd make an exception in this case if
			I were you.

Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting
			you.

						JANOSZ
			My pleasure.

Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially)
			I may be wrong, but I think you've got a
			little crush on this guy.

						DANA
			Good-bye, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (dragging his feet)
			I'd like to stay, but I really don't have
			time to hang around here.  I'll call you.
				 (calls out to Janosz)
			Later, Johnny!

He exits.

VIGO

Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab
area.

						STANTZ
			Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have
			something really amazing to show you.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Spengler)
			It's not that thing you do with your
			nostrils, is it?

Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among
the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a
Tupperware container.

						STANTZ
				 (to Venkman)
			We've been studying the stuff that we took
			from the subway tunnel.

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.

						VENKMAN
			And now you're going to eat it?

						STANTZ
			No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a
large Petri dish.

						STANTZ
			Now watch this.

He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.

						STANTZ
				 (simulating anger)
			You worthless piece of slime!!
				 (as the slime starts to
				 twitch and glow)
			You ignorant disgusting blob!!

SPECIMEN

It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.

						STANTZ
			You foul, obnoxious muck!!

STANTZ

He continues venting his rage on the slime.

						STANTZ
			I've seen some real crud in my time, but
			you're a chemical disgrace!!

The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the
Petri dish.

STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They turn to Venkman for his reaction.  He's dumbfounded.

						VENKMAN
			This is what you do with your spare time?

						STANTZ
				 (very excited)
			This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.
			A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this
			is, it clearly responds to human emotional
			states.

						VENKMAN
			'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff
			and sell it.

						SPENGLER
			We've found it at every event site we've
			been to lately.

						WINSTON
				 (poking at the slime)
			You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad
			vibes'?

						STANTZ
			Like a goat on garbage.

						STANTZ
			We're running tests to see if we can get an
			equally strong positive reaction.

						VENKMAN
			What kind of tests?

						STANTZ
				 (a little embarrassed)
			Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say
			supportive, nurturing things --

						VENKMAN
			You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

Spengler reacts as if he might be.

						STANTZ
			It really responds to music.
				 (to Spengler)
			Let's calm it down.

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to
the slime specimen.

SPECIMEN

It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.

						WINSTON
			Does it have any favorites?

						STANTZ
			It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,'
			'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small
			World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.

						STANTZ
			Watch this.

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's "HIGHER AND HIGHER"
BLASTS from the speakers.

TOASTER

It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.

VENKMAN

He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.

						VENKMAN
			I don't care what you say.  This could be a
			major Christmas gift item.

						WINSTON
			Right, and the first time someone gets mad,
			their toaster will eat their hand.

						VENKMAN
			So we'll put a warning on the label.

Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving.  Venkman looks
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the toaster)
			Go ahead.  I dare you.

Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand
and won't let go.  The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and
easily withdraws his hand.

						VENKMAN
			Just kidding.

INT.  DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet.  She's
wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby.  She
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water
temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.

						DANA
				 (talking sweetly to the
				 baby)
			Look at you.  I think we got more food on
			your shirt than we got in your mouth.

BATHTUB

The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the
bottom of the tub.  Dana reaches over and turns off the water without
looking into the tub.  When she turns away, both taps start to spin by
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.

DANA

Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath
into the tub.

BATHTUB

The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the
bubble bath.

DANA
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.  Dana screams, snatches the
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)

The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old
magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment.  Venkman is asleep on the
floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed
just short of the bedroom.  The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to
his feet and answers it.  He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,
wrapped in a baby blanket.

						DANA
				 (somewhat embarrassed to
				 be there)
			I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?

						VENKMAN
				 (surprised to see her)
			No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.
			Come on in.
				 (noting her apparel)
			Are we having a pajama party?

						DANA
				 (upset)
			Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

Venkman looks at her for a long moment.

						VENKMAN
			You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd
			have serious doubts.  But coming from you,
			I can't honestly say I'm surprised.

						DANA
			I must be losing my mind.  At the museum
			today I could have sworn that terrible
			painting of Vigo looked right at me.

						VENKMAN
			Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this
			nightgown?

						DANA
				 (distraught)
			I don't know what to do anymore.

						VENKMAN
			I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the
			bathtub.  You better stay here.

He exits to the bathroom.  She looks around the loft, amazed at the
disorder.  Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and
takes Oscar from her.

						VENKMAN
			Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.

He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts
tying it around him like a diaper.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the baby)
			This is Joe Namath's old number, you know.
			You could get a lot of chicks with this.
			Just don't pee in it.

						DANA
			Peter, what about the bathtub?

						VENKMAN
				 (grabs the phone and dials)
			We'll take care of that.
				 (on the phone)
			Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right
			away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --
			tried to eat the kid.

						DANA
			It was full of this awful pink ooze.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Ray)
			Sounds like another slime job ... No,
			they're all right.  They're here now ...
			Right ... Let me know.

He hangs up.

						VENKMAN
			They're going over there right now.  You
			might as well make yourself at home.  Let
			me show you around.
				 (he crosses to the kitchen area)
			This is the cuisine de maison --

It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the
counters are littered with all sorts of food trash.  He grabs a big open
Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.

						VENKMAN
				 (looking at the sink)
			We may have to wash some of these if you get
			hungry --
				 (he looks in the fridge)
			-- but there's no food anyway so forget
			about it.  I have all kinds of carry-out
			menus if you feel like ordering.

He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then
crosses to the bathroom.

						VENKMAN
			Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy
			up a few things.

						DANA
			Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have
			to do any of this, you know.

He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING
and more items going into the Hefty bag.

						VENKMAN (O.S.)
			The shower works but it's a little tricky.
			They're both marked "Hot."  It takes a little
			practice, but at least this one won't try
			and eat you.

He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his
shoulder.

						VENKMAN
			Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.
			But the bed's good and I just changed the
			sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In
			fact, I think you should definitely plan on
			spending the night here.

						DANA
			Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping
			arrangements?

						VENKMAN
			For me it's best if I sleep on my side and
			you spoon up right behind me with your arms
			around me.  If we go the other way I'm
			afraid your hair will be getting in my face
			all night.

						DANA
			How about you on the sofa and me in bed with
			the baby.

						VENKMAN
			Or we could do that.

						DANA
			Thank you.
				 (she picks up Oscar)
			Poor baby.  I think I should put him down
			now.

						VENKMAN
			I'll put him down for you.
				 (taking the baby)
			You are way too short!  And your belly-button
			sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to
			your poor mother!

Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living
room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.

						VENKMAN
			Did you find anything at Dana's?

						STANTZ
			Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in
			and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up
			some interesting stuff on this Vigo character
			you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the
			Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,
			Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

						SPENGLER
				 (reads from xerox of entry)
			"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"

						VENKMAN
			A hundred and five years?  He really hung
			on, didn't he.

						STANTZ
			And he didn't die of old age either.  He was
			poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
			disemboweled, drawn and quartered.

						WINSTON
			I guess he wasn't too popular at the end
			there.

						SPENGLER
			No, not exactly a man of the people.
				 (reads)
			"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
			Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the
			Unholy."

						STANTZ
			This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in
			all the Black Arts, and listen to this
			prophecy.  Just before his head died, his
			last words were, "Death is but a door, time
			is but a window.  I'll be back."

						VENKMAN
			That's it?  "I'll be back?"

						SPENGLER
			It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.

INT.  MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.

						RUDY
			Hey, Dr. Venkman.  What's going on?

						VENKMAN
			We're just going up to Restorations for a
			minute.

						RUDY
			Oh, I can't let you do that.  Mr. Poha told
			me not to let you up there anymore.

						VENKMAN
				 (with mock seriousness)
			Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but
			I think you can be trusted.  Tell him, Ray.

						STANTZ
				 (very official)
			Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic,
			subfusionary flux in this building.

						RUDY
			We got a flux?

						WINSTON
			You got a flux and a half.

						STANTZ
			Now if you don't want to be the --
				 (he counts)
			-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock
			from a planar rift, I suggest you get down
			behind that desk and don't move until we
			give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters
head upstairs.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter.  He
rushes over and stops them at the door.

						JANOSZ
			Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.

						VENKMAN
			I know.

						JANOSZ
			Then why have you come?

						VENKMAN
			We got a major creep alert and we're just
			going down the list.  Your name was first.

						STANTZ
				 (to Spengler and Winston)
			Let's sweep it, boys.

They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you
			from, Johnny?

						JANOSZ
				 (nervous)
			The Upper West Side.

						SPENGLER
				 (consulting his PKE meter)
			This entire room is extremely hot, Peter.

						JANOSZ
			What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			We'll know when we find it.  You just sit
			tight.  This won't take long.

STANTZ

Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to
the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman
comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.

						VENKMAN
			This is the one that looked at Dana.

						JANOSZ
			It must be the chemical fumes in the studio.
			People start imagining things --

						VENKMAN
				 (interrupts)
			I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing
			theory.  If she says it looked at her, it
			looked at her.
				 (to Vigo)
			Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking
			to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking
			to you.

They watch the painting for any sign of movement.

VIGO

His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.

STANTZ AND VENKMAN

Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Vigo)
			Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby.
			Just have fun with it.
				 (to Stantz)
			Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish
			up and get out of here.

						STANTZ
			I'll get one more reading.

Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.

VIGO

His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.

STANTZ

He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle
transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks
the spell.

						WINSTON
				 (looking at the painting)
			Now that's one ugly dude.

						STANTZ
				 (coming back to his senses)
			Huh?  What?

						WINSTON
			You finished here?

						STANTZ
				 (distracted)
			What?  Yeah.

						WINSTON
			Are you all right?  You coming down with
			something?

						STANTZ
			No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for
			a second there.  Let's go.

They head for the door.

JANOSZ

He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.

						JANOSZ
			So you see, everything is in order, is it
			not?

						VENKMAN
			Not.  Don't leave town and report any change
			in your address to the proper authorities.
			We'll be back.

They exit.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.

						SPENGLER
			There's definitely something going on in

						WINSTON
			I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, that's a safe bet.
				 (to Stantz)
			You and Spengman see what else you can dig
			up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.
			Those two were made for each other.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse.  Stantz is at the
wheel.  His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense.  Stantz
swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.

						STANTZ
				 (to another driver)
			Idiot!
				 (honking)
			Move it, you jerk!

Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously
through traffic.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Winston looks at Ray, concerned.

						WINSTON
			Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray?

Stantz turns on him.

						STANTZ
				 (viciously)
			Are you telling me how to drive?

						WINSTON
			No, I just thought --

						STANTZ
			Well don't think!

He HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue.  Pedestrians leap to safety as
Stantz runs a red light.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.

						WINSTON
				 (to Stantz, really worried
				 now)
			Are you crazy, man?  You're going to kill
			somebody!

Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.

						STANTZ
			No, I'm going to kill everybody!

He swerves off the road.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car heads right for a big tree.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel
and steps across to stomp on the brakes.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car skids into the tree and stops.  The Ghostbusters stumble out
dazed and shaken, but unhurt.  Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the
others, completely at a loss.

						STANTZ
				 (himself again)
			What happened?

						VENKMAN
			You just picked up three penalty points on
			your driver's license.

						WINSTON
			Are you all right?

						STANTZ
			Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest
			thing.  I knew what I was doing but I
			couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling
			came over me and -- I don't know -- I just
			felt like driving into that tree and ending
			it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.

They inspect the damage to the car.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially, to
				 Spengler)
			Watch him, Egon.  Don't even let him shave.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)

There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman
enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small
suitcase of Dana's.

						VENKMAN
				 (calls out)
			I'm home!

He looks around the large open loft.

						VENKMAN
				 (to himself)
			I knew it.  She cleaned.

He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom.  The door is
half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through
the transparent vinyl curtain.  He closes the bathroom door and looks at
the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling
off.  Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the
bathroom wrapped in a towel.  She jumps back into the bathroom.

She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.

						VENKMAN
			Are you all squeaky clean now?

						DANA
				 (humoring him)
			Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything
			at my apartment?

She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.

						VENKMAN
				 (through the door)
			Nothing.  They stayed there all night, went
			through your personal stuff, made a bunch of
			long-distance phone calls and cleaned out
			your refrigerator.  And didn't find anything.

Dana opens the bedroom door.

						DANA
			They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub
			... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do
			I do now?

						VENKMAN
			Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a
			babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you
			need it.

						DANA
			I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar
			in a strange place with someone I don't know.

						VENKMAN
			It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's
			one of my most valuable employees.

						DANA
			Does she know anything about babies?

						VENKMAN
			Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?
				 (handing her the flowers)
			Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your
			clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I
			brought along some interesting possibilities.

						DANA
			Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.

She smiles and closes the door again.  He opens the closet and starts
looking for his good suit.

						VENKMAN
			Did you happen to see some shirts on the
			floor in here?

						DANA (O.S.)
			I put them in your hamper.  I thought they
			were dirty.

						VENKMAN
				 (shaking his head)
			I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first,
			okay.  I have more than two grades of
			laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels
			between clean and dirty.

He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.

						VENKMAN
			These aren't so bad yet.  You just hang them
			up for a while and they're fine.

												 CUT TO:
INT.  FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING

Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.
Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs.  She starts
primping and freshening up her makeup.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME

Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once
and for all.  He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.

						LOUIS
				 (to himself)
			Okay, Stinky, this is it.  Showdown time.
			You and me, pal.  You think you're smarter
			than I am?  We'll see about that.
				 (loud)
			Oh, hello, Pizza Man!  Oh, two larges!  I
			only ordered one.  Oh, pepperoni and
			pineapple.  My absolute favorite.  I guess
			I'll have to eat these both by myself.

THE CEILING

Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging
upside down.

LOUIS

He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.

						LOUIS
				 (quietly)
			Okay, let's boogie!

He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a
gash across the ceiling.

THE STAIRS

Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and
strikes the wall behind her.  Slimer disappears.

						LOUIS
				 (embarrassed and apologetic)
			Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do
			that.  It was an accident.

						JANINE
			What are you doing up here?

						LOUIS
			I was trying to get that smelly green thing.
			The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the
			fifth Ghostbuster.

						JANINE
			Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if
			you're already an accountant?

						LOUIS
			Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls
			in sick or gets hurt.

Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.

						JANINE
			Have you made any plans yet?  You know
			tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

						LOUIS
			No, I celebrate at the beginning of my
			corporate tax year which is March first.
			That way I beat the crowds.

						JANINE
			That's very practical.  I hate going out on
			New Year's Eve, too.

There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.

						JANINE
			Well, good night, Louis.

						LOUIS
				 (on an impulse)
			Janine, do you feel like maybe getting
			something to eat on the way home?

						JANINE
			I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd
			babysit.
				 (seductively)
			Do you want to babysit with me?

						LOUIS
			Oh, sure, that sounds great.

They exit.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)

There is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it.  He's dressed
for the evening and looking very dapper.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing
there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and
miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection
jars and photographic equipment.  They look like they're rigged out for a
major spelunking expedition.

						VENKMAN
				 (ushering them in)
			Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat
			barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?

						STANTZ
			We're going down into the sewer system to
			see if we can trace the source of the
			psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you
			might want to come along.

						VENKMAN
			Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going.
			I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

						SPENGLER
			You know, animals and lower life forms often
			anticipate major disasters.  Given the new
			magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous
			breeding surge in the cockroach population.

						VENKMAN
			Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.
				 (calls out)
			Dana?  The boys are going down under the
			sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon
			thinks there might even be some kind of big
			roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about
			dinner and go with them instead?

Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.

						STANTZ
			Wow.

Dana looks curiously at their outfits.

						DANA
			Hi.

They nod and wave back.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Ray and Egon)
			I think we're going to have to pass on the
			sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find
			out.

						STANTZ
				 (on his exit)
			Okay, but you're missing all the fun.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER)

Stantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,
guided by a very old map of the underground city.

						STANTZ
			This is it.  Van Horne Station.  Right where
			the old transit map said it would be.

They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.

						STANTZ
			Let's get a sounding on the depth of that
			flow.

Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of
it attached to his utility belt.

						STANTZ
			Stand back.

He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and
casts it out into the middle of the flow.  The plumb bob sinks and
Spengler reads the depth.

						SPENGLER
			Six feet -- seven -- eight --

						STANTZ
			That's it.  It's on the bottom.

						SPENGLER
			Nine feet -- ten --

						WINSTON
			Is the line sinking?

						SPENGLER
			No, the slime is rising.

Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the
platform and around his boots.

						STANTZ
				 (alarmed)
			Let's get out of here, boys.

He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.

Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger
than all three of them.  As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and
closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his
belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt.  Spengler lets go in time
but Winston doesn't.  He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.
Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in
after him.

INT.  ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)

Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling
caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.

						VENKMAN
				 (very intimate)
			Here's to -- us.

She sighs and drinks.

						VENKMAN
			So -- are you making any New Year's
			resolutions?

						DANA
			I want to stop getting involved with men who
			aren't good for me.

						VENKMAN
			Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,
			or could you hold off for a few days maybe?

						DANA
			For one night in your life, do you think
			it's possible for us to be completely real?

						VENKMAN
			All right, you want to be real?  So tell me
			why did you dump me?

						DANA
			Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had
			to protect myself.  You really weren't very
			good for me, you know.

						VENKMAN
			I'm not even good for me.

						DANA
			Why do you say things like that?  You're so
			much better than you know.

						VENKMAN
			Thank you.  If I had that kind of support
			on a daily basis, I could definitely shape
			up by the turn of the century.

						DANA
				 (already feeling the
				 effects of the champagne)
			So why don't you give me a jingle in the
			year 2000?

						VENKMAN
			Let me jingle you right now.

He leans over to kiss her.

						DANA
			Maybe I should call Janine.

						VENKMAN
			Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way
			with children.

They kiss.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.

						JANINE
				 (looking around)
			I can't believe a person could actually live
			like this.

						LOUIS
				 (to the baby)
			So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in
			a small mining operation and then one day a
			beautiful princess came to live with them.

						JANINE
			It's really not a bad place.  It just needs
			a woman's touch.

						LOUIS
				 (continuing)
			So they bartered room and board in exchange
			for housekeeping services, which was a good
			deal for all of them because then they didn't
			have to withhold tax and social security,
			which I'm not saying is right but it's just
			a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can
			finish this later if you're tired.

Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.

						JANINE
			You're really good with children, Louis.  I
			can tell.
				 (as he returns)
			Why don't you come here and sit with me?

						LOUIS
			Okay.

He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.

						JANINE
				 (getting close)
			Motherhood is a very natural instinct for
			me.  I'd like to have a baby myself.
			Wouldn't you?

						LOUIS
				 (gulps)
			Tonight?

EXT.  STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below.  It slides away,
and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.
They are exhausted and covered with slime.

						WINSTON
				 (uncharacteristically
				 angry)
			Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to
			do -- drown me?

						STANTZ
				 (unusually mean)
			Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were
			too stupid to drop that line.

						WINSTON
				 (shoves him)
			You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll
			punch your lights out.

						STANTZ
			Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead
			and try it.

Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.

						SPENGLER
			If you two are looking for a fight, you got
			one.
				 (putting up his fists)
			Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me,
			sucker.

						STANTZ
				 (squaring off)
			Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had
			it with you.

They grab each other and start to tussle.  Suddenly Spengler comes to his
senses and pulls them apart.

						SPENGLER
				 (forcefully)
			Strip!  Right now!  Get out of those clothes!

He starts yanking off his slicker and waders.  Bewildered, Stantz and
Winston start doing the same.  Spengler helps pull off their clothes and
throws them into the open manhole.  Now wearing only long underwear, they
seem to return to normal.

						WINSTON
			What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill
			you.

						STANTZ
			Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff
			is like pure, concentrated evil.

Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the
museum.

						SPENGLER
			And it's all flowing right to this spot.

			Can I help you?

Stantz looks around and spots Venkman.

						STANTZ
			That's all right, I see him.

They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.

VENKMAN

He's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston
coming toward him through the restaurant.

						STANTZ
				 (very excited)
			You should've been there, Venkman.
			Absolutely incredible!

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, sorry I missed it.
				 (noting their attire)
			I guess you guys didn't know about the dress
			code here.  It's really kind of a coat and
			tie place.

						STANTZ
			It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under
			it actually.

						WINSTON
			Rivers of the stuff!

						SPENGLER
			And it's all flowing toward the museum.

He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and
lands on a well-dressed diner.

						STANTZ
				 (calls out)
			Sorry!

						DANA
			Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.

Venkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues
aside.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially)
			Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights.
			Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?

						SPENGLER
				 (to Venkman)
			This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.
			It's hot and it's ready to pop.

MAITRE D'

He hurries through the restaurant with two city COPS right behind him and
makes straight for Venkman's table.

						MAITRE D'
			Arrest these men.

						COP
				 (recognizing them)
			Hey!  It's the Ghostbusters.  You're out of
			uniform, gentlemen

Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look.

						STANTZ
				 (self-conscious)
			Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but
			forget that.  We have to see the mayor as
			soon as possible.

						COP
			Look, Doc, why don't you just go home.
			You'll get a good night's sleep and then you
			can give the mayor a call in the morning.
			Come on.

He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.

						STANTZ
			We're not going anywhere with you.  I told
			you we have to see the mayor now.

						COP
				 (grabbing Stantz)
			I'm warning you.  You can come along
			peaceably or --

						VENKMAN
				 (grabs the Cop)
			Hey, don't be an idiot.  This is serious.

						COP
				 (angry)
			Look, pal, keep this up and you're going
			with them.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, yeah?

						COP
				 (has had enough)
			Yeah, let's go.  You're all under arrest.

The Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the
restaurant.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Dana)
			Finish your dessert -- it's already paid
			for.  I'll call you.

They all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners.

EXT.  ARMAND'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The police car is parked right behind Ecto-2.  Spengler stops at the

						SPENGLER
			Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy.
			This is a matter of vital importance.

Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags.

						COP
			What are you doing?

						VENKMAN
			I just want to get your names right for when

			No, nobody called.

Dana frowns.

						DANA
			Is everything all right with Oscar?

						JANINE
			Oh, he's fine.  He's such a good baby.  He

City.

INT.  GRACIE MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

The Ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are
ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors.  The
butler knocks lightly, then opens the door to reveal the MAYOR sitting in
front of the fireplace in his well-appointed private study, flanked by
Jack Hardemeyer, both in tuxedoes.  The Ghostbusters enter.

INT.  STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of
his formal reception.  He frowns at their bizarre attire.

						MAYOR
			All right -- the Ghostbusters.  I'll tell
			you right now; I've got two hundred of the

			You've got two minutes.  Make it good.

						STANTZ
			You get enough negative energy flowing in a

			on a hotplate.

						WINSTON
			Tell him about the toaster.

						VENKMAN
			I don't think he's ready for the toaster.

						MAYOR
				 (shaking his head)
			Being miserable and treating other people
			like dirt is every New Yorker's God-given
			right.  What am I supposed to do -- go on
			television and tell eight million people
			they have to be nice to each other?  I'm
			sorry, none of this makes any sense to me,
			and if anything does happen we've got plenty
			of paid professionals to deal with it.  Your

The mayor exits, leaving the Ghostbusters to Hardemeyer.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (smirking)
			That's quite a story.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, I think the Times might be interested,

			I'm telling you, we're not crazy.  He is!

HARDEMEYER

He laughs off the remark.

Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby.
Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes.

LOUIS AND JANINE

They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition.

EXT.  VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION

A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling
on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.  Her face looks
remarkably like Janosz Poha's.  The nanny extends her hand to the BABY
who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it.

DANA

She watches in helpless horror.

						DANA
				 (screams)
			No!!

GHOST NANNY

She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and
smiles at Dana.  The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny
shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.

DANA

She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through
the window assisted by Louis and Janine.

						DANA

			You're wasting valuable time!  We have reason

						PSYCHIATRIST
			Yes, tell me about the slime.

						WINSTON
			It's potent stuff.  We made a toaster dance
			with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his

The psychiatrist looks at Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			Don't look at me.  I think they're nuts.

INT.  MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in
eerie white light.  Oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the
painting of Vigo.  Dana enters cautiously and sees the baby.  Seeing no
one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the
baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and
intact.

						JANOSZ (O.S.)
			I knew you would come.

Startled, Dana turns at the sound of his voice as Janosz steps out from
behind the Vigo painting.

						DANA
				 (defiantly)
			What do you want with my baby?

						JANOSZ
			No harm will come to the child.  You might
			even say it's a privilege.  He will be the
			vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you --
			well, you will be the mother of the ruler
			of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?

						DANA
			If this is what the world will be like, I
			don't want to live in it.

						JANOSZ
				 (confidentially, indicating
				 Vigo)
			I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.

						DANA
			Everybody has a choice.

						JANOSZ
			Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look.
			That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there.
			He's Vigo!

						DANA
			I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my
			baby.

Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms,
floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.

DANA

She turns and looks at Vigo, for the first time feeling his power.

						JANOSZ
			You will see.  It's all for the best.

The Ghostbusters are sitting in the dayroom, a dingy lounge for patients

wire mesh covering the windows.

						STANTZ
			This is it. boys.  It's starting.  Shit-storm

Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.

						SHERMAN
			I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I

			Why can't you just have them released?
			You're a doctor.

			You were the one who got me in.

			I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she

						SHERMAN
			Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion

						LOUIS
			I'm telling you, we're all going to be in

HOTEL ENTRANCE

A well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps
toward the revolving door.  She looks up at the sky and frowns.

						WOMAN
				 (shrewish)
			I told you we should have stayed in Palm
			Beach.  The weather here gets stranger every

						MAN
			Yes, dear.

She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of
her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat.  The doorman nods
courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs.

WOMAN

She yelps in pain.

						WOMAN
				 (to the doorman)
			Something just bit me!

The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat
comes alive.  MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and
YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.  Reacting quickly, the
doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and
starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.
The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)(LATER)

ECTO-2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum.  Hundreds of
spectators are already there gawking at the building as the Ghostbusters
jump out and gape at the sight that greets them.

EXT.  MUSEUM THEIR POV - BUILDING

The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime.
CITY WORKMEN and FIREMEN are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches,
jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make
a dent.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They size up the situation as they don their proton packs.

						STANTZ
			It looks like a giant Jello mold.

						VENKMAN
			I hate Jello.

They stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to
the museum.

						STANTZ
				 (to the Fire Captain)
			Okay, give it a rest, Captain.  We'll take
			it from here.

						FIRE CAPTAIN
				 (skeptical)
			Be my guest.  We been cutting here for three
			hours.  What the hell's going on?  You know
			the Titanic arrived this morning?

						VENKMAN
			Well, better late than never.

The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the
Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers.

						SPENGLER
				 (monitoring valences)
			Full neutronas, maser assist.

They adjust their settings and prepare to fire.

						STANTZ
			Throw 'em!

They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building
with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the firemen)
			Okay, who knows "Cumbaya?"

A few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.  Venkman
grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum.

						VENKMAN
			All right.  Nice and sweet --
				 (starts singing)
			Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya --

Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding
hands and swaying to the music.

						ALL
				 (singing)
			Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord,
			cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya.

Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that
they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime.

						STANTZ
			Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't
			get through this stuff.

						VENKMAN
			Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say
			supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?

						SPENGLER
			It won't work.  There's no way we could
			generate enough positive energy to crack
			that shell.

						STANTZ
			I can't believe things have gotten so bad
			in this city that there's no way back.
			Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy.
			And there are too many people who'd just as
			soon step on your face as look at you.  But
			there've got to be a few sparks of sweet
			humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We
			just have to mobilize it.

						SPENGLER
			We need something that everyone can get
			behind, a symbol --

His eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a
line drawing of the Statue of Liberty.

						STANTZ
				 (he sees it, too)
			Something that appeals to the best in each
			and every one of us --

						SPENGLER
			Something good --

						VENKMAN
			And pure --

						WINSTON
			And decent.

EXT.  THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives
with a police escort.  Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor
himself and they cross to the museum entrance.

Hardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the
Ghostbusters.

						HARDEMEYER
			Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff
			together, get back in that clown car and get
			out of here.  This is a city matter and
			everything's under control.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for
			you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law
			in there and he's got my girlfriend and her
			kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when
			you're partying uptown, this guy's going to
			come to life and start doing amateur head
			transplants.  And that's just round one.

						MAYOR
			Are you telling me there're people trapped
			in there?

						HARDEMEYER
				 (to his assistant)
			This is dynamite.  Call A.P., U.P.I., and
			C.N.N. and get them down here right away.
			When the police bring this kid out I want
			them to hand it right to the mayor and I
			want it all on camera.

						STANTZ
			Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by
			midnight, you're going to go down in history
			as the man who let New York get sucked down
			into the tenth level of hell.

The Mayor stops to consider the situation.

						MAYOR
				 (to the Fire Captain)
			Can you get into that museum?

						FIRE CAPTAIN
			If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe.

The Mayor turns to Venkman.

						MAYOR
			You know why all these things are happening?

						VENKMAN
			We tried to tell you last night, but Mr.
			Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony
			bin.

Hardemeyer flips out.

						HARDEMEYER
			This is preposterous!  You can't seriously
			believe all this mumbo-jumbo!  It's the
			Twentieth Century, for crying out loud!
				 (viciously, to Venkman)
			Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff
			is or how you got it all over the museum,
			but you better get it off and I mean right
			now!

He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in
amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily
through the slime curtain.  Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the
slime.

						MAYOR
				 (to Venkman)
			Okay, just tell me what you need.

hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators.
Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them.

						VENKMAN
			Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

						WINSTON
			Wonder what?

						VENKMAN
			If she's naked under that toga.  She's
			French, you know.

						SPENGLER
			There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons

Stantz is looking worried.

Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to
various relays on the interior surface of the statue.  Venkman and Stantz
are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase.
They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks
and gives the order.

			Okay, boys.  Let's frost it.

They begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho-reactive
slime.

			Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really

STANTZ

He plugs the main cable lead into a transformer.

						STANTZ
			It's all yours, Pete.

			There's not much time left.

Venkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat.

He hits "Play" on the Walkman and "HIGHER AND HIGHER" BOOMS from the huge
SPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior.

			Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.

With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from
head to toe, blowing him into the corner.  Then they turn to Vigo.

VIGO

He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the
knees down.  He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash
his magic powers.

They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been
neutralized by the good will of the people.

			Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?

						STANTZ
				 (smiles lovingly)
			Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, no.  We've got to live with this?

They pull him to his feet.

						STANTZ
			I love you guys.  You're the best friends
			I've ever had.

He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well.  Venkman recoils
in disgust.

						VENKMAN
			Hey, I just had this suit cleaned.
				 (indicating Janosz)
			Take care of the wiggler, will you.

Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.  She hugs Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			What is this -- a love in?
				 (notes the symbols painted
				 on the baby's body)
			Hey, sailor.  I think the tattoos are a
			little much, don't you?

He picks up the baby.

						DANA
				 (to Venkman)
			I think he likes you.  I think I do too.

						VENKMAN
			Finally came to your senses, huh?

They hug and kiss.

SPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ

They help Janosz to his feet.  He's dazed but unhurt.

						JANOSZ
				 (restored to normalcy)
			What happened?

						STANTZ
				 (calmly)
			Sir, you had a violent, prolonged,
			transformative psychic episode.  But it's
			over now.  Want a coffee?

						JANOSZ
				 (extremely nice)
			That's very kind of you.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Stantz)
			He's fine, Ray.  Physically intact,
			psychomagnetherically neutral.

						JANOSZ
			Is that good?

						WINSTON
			It's where you want to be.

As they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by
Vigo's self-portrait.

						SPENGLER
			Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or
			Brunelleschi.

						WINSTON
				 (staring at it)
			There's something very familiar about this
			painting.

INT.  MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT

It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four
archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby.  One holds a harp,
one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword.  Most
remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,
Spengler and Winston.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A city bus pulls up near the museum and Louis steps off.  He waves his
thanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel.

						LOUIS
				 (to Slimer)
			Okay, so Monday night we'll get something
			to eat and maybe go bowling?  Can you bowl
			with those little arms?

SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.

						LOUIS
			Okay, I have to go save Dana.  I'll see you
			later.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)

The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come
out the main entrance with Dana and the baby.  Everybody starts singing
"Auld Lang Syne."  Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and
finds the Ghostbusters.

						LOUIS
			Am I too late?

						STANTZ
			No, you're right on time.

Stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him.

EXT.  MUSEUM ENTRANCE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime.  He looks at the
celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (weepy)
			Happy New Year, everybody!

He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne."

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT (LATER)

The Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind
the museum, her toga up over her knees.  The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.
The Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.

						VENKMAN
			She's all right.  She's just sleeping it off.

						MAYOR
				 (stricken)
			We just had it restored.

						VENKMAN
			This probably isn't a good time to bring
			this up, but the last time we did a job for
			the city you stiffed us.

						STANTZ
				 (handing the Mayor an
				 invoice)
			This is a bill for tonight's job.

The Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.

						MAYOR
			What!  This is way too much.
				 (hands the bill back to
				 Venkman)
			We won't pay.

Venkman looks at the Statue.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Stantz)
			I think she looks pretty good here, don't
			you?

						STANTZ
			Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

Realizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.

				MAYOR
		All right, all right.  If you can wait until
		Monday I'll issue you a check.

				SPENGLER
		Sorry.  No checks.  Company policy.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY (WEEKS LATER)

The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she
belongs.  The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.

				VENKMAN
			(looking up at the statue)
		Pretty impressive, huh?

				SPENGLER
			(musing)
		It's probably the first thing my
		grandparents saw when they came to this
		country.

				VENKMAN
		From where -- Neptune?

				SPENGLER
		They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.

				VENKMAN
		Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.

				STANTZ
			(in a similarly reflective
			mood)
		My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still
		have the pictures they took of the statue
		from the boat when they arrived.

				VENKMAN
		Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to
		America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I
		recall.  How about you, Winston?

						WINSTON
			My people weren't taking any pictures from
			those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't
			any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome
			them, either.  What are you, Dana?

						VENKMAN
			Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here
			since the year 12.

						DANA
			That's not true.  It was 1620.

						VENKMAN
			Same difference.

						STANTZ
			What's your story, Pete?

						VENKMAN
			Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish,
			some German, some French, Dutch -- the women
			in my family slept around.  And that's what
			made this country great.

						DANA
			That's a terrible thing to say.

						VENKMAN
			So what?  It's a free country.
				 (looking up at the Statue)
			Thanks, Lib.

They all look up at the Statue.

EXT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - HEAD OF STATUE - DAY

Slimer flies out one of the observation windows, THEME MUSIC KICKS IN and
the CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY FROM the island TO a HIGH SHOT of the
Statue, lower Manhattan and the shining sea beyond.

											FADE OUT.

          1   INT. BILLY OFFICE (BREWSTER KEEGAN INVESTMENT BANK)- 4:50 PM

                                                                         1
              BILLY CARVER (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting
              at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex-
              girlfriend.

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                     Billy Boy!
              J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters
              the office.

                                  J.D.
                     Get your ass ready! It's almost five
                     o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his
                     drink on!
              J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.

                                  J.D.
                     Oh God. Give me that.     I'm burning it
                     once and for all.
              J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as
              the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.

                                  BILLY
                     Don't!

                                  J.D.
                     Dude, it's been six months.    You have to
                     move on.
              BILLY nods knowingly.

                                  J.D.
                     You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot
                     chick riding your jock all night long.

                                  BILLY
                     You're such a romantic, J.D.

                                  J.D.
                     It would help get your mind off of Sarah.
              BILLY ponders this for a moment.

                                  BILLY
                     Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other
                     women, I wouldn't even know what to do.
                     I've been out of the game so long.

                                  J.D.
                     Billy, you come out with me tonight, and
                     I promise you'll get laid.

                                  BILLY
                     Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson
                     needs me to update the financial models
                     for his meeting with the foreign
                     investors.

                                  J.D.
                     So what? It's Friday!      You have all
                     weekend to do that.

                                  BILLY
                     No I don't. The Germans are taking an
                     earlier flight back, so the meeting's
                     been moved to tomorrow.
              J.D. thinks for a moment.

                                  J.D.
                     Well, why don't you just get somebody
                     else to do your work then?

                                  BILLY
                     Who?
              J.D. gets a big smile on his face.    He has an idea.

          2   INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - 4:55 PM                                 2
              HAROLD LEE (22 years old, the typical Asian-American
              workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up
              his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day.
              BILLY and J.D. approach...

                                  BILLY
                     Harold, listen, I need you to update
                     these models for me.

                                  HAROLD
                            (confused)
                     But aren't you supposed to...

                                  BILLY
                     I know, but something came up. I have to
                     meet with some clients tonight, so I
                     won't be able to get to it. It's your
                     responsibility now. Okay?
              Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to
              protest, J.D. steps forward...

                                  J.D.
                     And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine
                     o'clock sharp.

                     With all the downsizing going on around
                     here, we wouldn't want to have to tell
                     Berenson that you've been slacking. He's
                     just dying to figure out who he should
                     fire next.

                                  HAROLD
                     Uh...okay...no problem...
              BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk.

          3   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - 5:00 PM                    3
              BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot.

                                   BILLY
                     Wow!   I can't believe how easy that was!

                                  J.D.
                     Dude, how do you think I get all my shit
                     done? I'm telling you -- those Asian
                     guys love crunching numbers. You
                     probably just made his weekend.
              The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE.

          4   INT. J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE                                       4
              Billy and J.D. enter the car.

                                  J.D.
                     Now get ready. It's time we embark
                     on...Operation Get Some!
              And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes
              the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy
              song kicks in.
              Intercut:

          5   INT/EXT. J.D'S CONVERTABLE                                    5
              Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through
              the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick
              in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it.
              When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats
              in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner.
              J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his
              car zooms out of the parking lot.

          
              QUICK BOOM UP from J.D.'s Convertible and PUSH IN to Harold
              standing at a window watching as Billy and J.D. zoom off.
              He looks at the stack of papers they gave him...

          7   INT. DR. WOODRUFF'S OFFICE - NYU MEDICAL SCHOOL                  7
              KUMAR PATEL (22, Indian, Funky Hair) is answering questions
              from his NYU Medical School interviewer, DR. Woodruff (middle
              aged, erudite, very professional). Kumar has NO ACCENT.
              He's American.

                                  KUMAR
                     Mononucleosis or mono is an infection
                     caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
                     Symptoms may include fever, sore throat,
                     headaches, white patches on the back of
                     your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness
                     and loss of appetite.

                                  DR. WOODRUFF
                     Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're
                     one of the best applicants I've ever
                     interviewed. Not that it's a surprise.
                     Your father is very respected in his
                     field. You know he and I had some pretty
                     wild times when we were in med school.

                                    KUMAR
                     Really?

                                  DR. WOODRUFF
                     Yeah. We started our own basketball team--
                     the Hemoglobin Trotters...
                            (cracking up)
                     Yeah, we were crazy.
              Kumar nods and smiles.   Woodruff finally stops laughing...

                                  DR. WOODRUFF
                     Anyway-- just one more question.
                            (reading from a clipboard)
                     What are some potential symptoms of
                     pancreatitis?

                                  KUMAR
                     Let's see. There might be epigastric
                     tenderness, diffuse abdominal
                     tenderness...
              Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a
              gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody
              smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls
              out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Dr. Woodruff)
                 I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second?
          Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.

                              KUMAR
                        (into the phone)
                 Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking.
                        (listening)
                 Oh, hey.
                        (listening)
                 Nothing important. I can talk. What's up?
          Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of
          coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office.
          Intercut:

          INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - SIMULTANEOUS
          Harold is talking on his office phone...

                              HAROLD
                 I'm not gonna be able to partake in our
                 usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta
                 stay late at the office.

                              KUMAR
                        (into the phone)
                 Fuck that shit! We had plans!
          Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.

                              HAROLD
                 I know, but I gotta get this work done.

                              KUMAR
                 Oh come on! When has getting high ever
                 prevented you from finishing your work?
          Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply
          slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt.
          Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.

                              HAROLD (O.S.)
                 Listen, I'd love to go home, but...

                              KUMAR
                 No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter
                 of the finest herb in New York City, and
                 I'm not smoking it alone.

                              KUMAR (cont'd)
                 So you're just gonna have to chill the
                 fuck out, bring your work home, and
                 prepare to get blazed, because in a
                 couple of hours I expect both of us to be
                 blitzed out of our skulls. Got it?...Okay
                 good. See you later.
          Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down.      Dr. Woodruff is
          stunned.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Dr. Woodruff)
                 Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More
                 symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased
                 bowel sounds, possibly fever,
                 dehydration, and sometimes even shock.

                              DR. WOODRUFF
                        (livid)
                 Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a
                 proper interview. Do you actually believe
                 after the way you've behaved that I would
                 ever even consider recommending you for
                 admission?

                                KUMAR
                 No.    I'd actually be pretty surprised.
          Dr. Woodruff is flustered.   He doesn't know how to react.

                              KUMAR
                 Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad
                 will keep paying for my apartment. I'm
                 not really planning on going to med
                 school.

                              DR. WOODRUFF
                        (confused)
                 But...you have perfect MCAT scores!

                              KUMAR
                 Well, I'm not an idiot.
          Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words.
          Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr.
          Woodruff's desk. He picks it up.

                                KUMAR
                 Wow!    Is this your daughter?
          A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's
          hands.

               Harold shuts down his laptop. He then puts the laptop along
               with all his paperwork into a bag and leaves the office.

          9    EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT                                9
               Harold walks to the end of the parking lot, where his car is
               parked. As he walks, the strap of his laptop bag breaks and
               falls to the ground. Harold is frustrated as he picks it up.

          10   EXT. PARKING LOT EXIT GATE                                  10
               After other cars zoom through uninterrupted, the ELDERLY
               PARKING ATTENDANT stops Harold and checks his ID before
               letting him leave.

          11   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING PARKING LOT - 6:21 PM               11
               Harold's driving his WHITE INFINITI G20. He finds a spot...

                                    HAROLD
                      Yes!   Right in front...
               Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he
               starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND.
               The jeep is loaded with "alternative" stickers, and has a
               KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof.
               Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car.

                                   HAROLD
                             (frustrated, to himself)
                      Those assholes.
               The driver, COLE (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud
               mouth), puts down his window...
               COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK
               FRIENDS, who all laugh at Harold.

                                   COLE
                             (mock Asian accent)
                      This is America, dude! Learn how to
                      drive!

                      Better ruck tomorrow!
               Frustrated, Harold turns around and continues driving...

                He ends up parking far from the building. He has to parallel
                park. He's anal with his parking, going in and out a bunch
                of times, until the car is positioned perfectly in the spot.

          11B   EXT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING                  11B
                Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He
                walks up the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building...
                Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he
                sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of
                Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators.
                HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl.
                Harold takes a deep breath...

                                    HAROLD
                       Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous.

          11C   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY) - DAY                       11C
                Harold enters the building and walks over to Maria. They
                give each other a friendly smile. We hear a "BING" sound,
                indicating the elevator has arrived. The doors open and
                Harold and Maria walk inside.

          12    INT. ELEVATOR                                                12
                HAROLD and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes
                up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak...

                                    HAROLD
                       So Maria, what's been going on?

                                    MARIA
                       Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week.
                       How about you?

                                    HAROLD
                       My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I
                       caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy
                       who works next to me decided to bathe for
                       a change.

                                      MARIA
                       Really?

                                    HAROLD
                              (deadpan)
                       Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of
                       that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And
                       the guy next to me still smells like
                       crap. But a man can dream, right?

          

                               DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   9.

          

          
               Maria laughs.   Harold's pleased that his joke worked.

                                   HAROLD
                      So what are you up to tonight?

                                   MARIA
                      Actually, I'm probably gonna work out a
                      little bit, clean up the apartment, and
                      then go over to my boyfriend's place.
                      He's cooking me a really nice dinner.

                                   HAROLD
                             (disappointed)
                      Really?

                                    MARIA
                             (smiling)
                      Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of
                      that.
                             (beat)
                      I'll actually probably just sit on my
                      ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch
                      Blind Date.

                                   HAROLD
                             (playful)
                      That sounds awful.
               Harold laughs, as does Maria.    They smile at each other...

                                   HAROLD
                      Well, if you want some company, maybe you
                      could sit on your ass at my place.

                                     MARIA
                               (flirty)
                      Maybe.

          
               We hear the "BING" of the elevator...

          13   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING(LOBBY)                                 13
               We're back in the lobby. EVERYTHING THAT JUST HAPPENED WAS A
               FANTASY. Harold and Maria enter the elevator.

          14   INT. ELEVATOR                                                  14
               HAROLD and MARIA stand silently while the elevator goes up.
               It's clear Harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have
               the courage. They reach their floor and exit the elevator.

               MARIA walks over to her apartment and goes inside.

                                     HAROLD
                      Bye.

          16   INT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT - 6:30 PM                  16
               Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment. The place
               is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a
               poster of "BILLY MADISON."

                                     HAROLD
                      Kumar?

                                   KUMAR (O.C.)
                      Yeah, I'm in here!
               Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's
               Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the
               floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap
               posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a
               Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar
               is not in the room, however.

                                     HAROLD
                      Kumar?

                                     KUMAR (O.C.)
                      In here...
               Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA
               furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN
               FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a "clipping sound"
               coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked
               and appalled. Harold walks inside...

                                   HAROLD
                      Kumar, what the hell are you doing!

                                   KUMAR
                      I'm trimming my pubes.
               Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple
               more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR.

                                   HAROLD
                      Why aren't you doing this in your room!

                                   KUMAR
                      The mirror's in here.
                             (re: his crotch)
                      Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai
                      tree!

                                   HAROLD
                      I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on.

                                    KUMAR
                       Chill out. It makes my Johnson look
                       bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll
                       end up with pubes like my dad. You've
                       seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right?
                HAROLD notices something...

                                    HAROLD
                       Are those my scissors? Oh my God!     I
                       trim my nose hair with those!

                                    KUMAR
                       Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with
                       them for the past six months.

                                    HAROLD

                       GET THE HELL OUT OF MY ROOM!
                Kumar puts the scissors down and EXITS THE ROOM. Harold
                shakes his head and sets up his laptop on his desk...

                Kumar puts on some boxers and a T-shirt (I love Bush: the
                pussy not the president).

                                    KUMAR
                              (calling out to Harold)
                       So what the hell is your problem, anyway?

                                    HAROLD (O.C.)
                       Other than my roommate's boney ass?

          17    INT. HAROLD'S BEDROOM                                        17
                Harold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working.

                                    HAROLD
                              (calling out)
                       One of the senior analysts asked me to do
                       a bunch of his work for him tonight.
                Kumar walks back into Harold's room...

                                    KUMAR
                       I assume you gave him the appropriate "go
                       fuck yourself."

                                    HAROLD
                       If by "go fuck yourself" you mean "no
                       problem sir" then yes, he got the message
                       loud and clear.
                KUMAR shakes his head in disgust...

                                   KUMAR
                      Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me
                      today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say
                      "no" once in a while. Now lets get high.

                                    HAROLD
                      No.   I got a lot of work to finish.
               Kumar shuts Harold's laptop.

                                   KUMAR
                      Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to
                      get that shit done later. Come on, let's
                      smoke a couple joints.
               Harold thinks for a moment and then caves...

                                   HAROLD
                      One joint.

                                   KUMAR
                      One and a half. Now let's do this...
               Kumar exits the room...
               HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see
               organized in rows of suits and button downs.

          18   INT. LIVING ROOM                                           18
               Kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds
               AN M.C.A.T. TEST PREP BOOK. Kumar lifts open the cover--
               inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana.
               Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy.
               The phone next to the book starts to ring. Kumar doesn't
               care. He lets it ring until the answering machine picks up.

                                   MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT
                             (on the answering machine)
                      Kumar...it is daddy. I hope your
                      interview today was good. I'm calling to
                      remind you that you have another one
                      tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from
                      Cornell at 10:00 a.m. Do not be late!
               Kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the M.C.A.T.
               book and starts rolling a fat blunt...

                                   MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT
                      It is very important you show up on time!
                      Mommy and I will be very upset if you do
                      not go. Good luck, Kumar. Remember, the
                      meeting is at ten o'clock. Bye bye.

               Harold (still wearing his button-down shirt, only now
               untucked) enters the living room. Kumar is now licking the
               blunt.

                                   HAROLD
                      Don't you think you should take at least
                      one of your interviews seriously? At some
                      point your dad's gonna get really pissed.

                                   KUMAR
                      So what? It's not like there's a
                      shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My
                      dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor.
                      Just because everyone in my family went
                      to med school, doesn't mean I have to.

                                   HAROLD
                      Well, then what are you going to do?

                                   KUMAR
                      I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm
                      gonna smoke this fat blunt, get
                      ridiculously high, and then get something
                      to eat.

                                   HAROLD
                      Sounds like a plan.

               HAROLD takes the first hit off the blunt. He nods to Kumar,
               as if to say "that's good shit." Kumar takes the blunt from
               Harold and inhales...

               Harold and Kumar are now smoking out of an ENORMOUS BONG,
               while watching TV. The room is filled with smoke.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION
               It's an episode of "The Router Workshop."

                      I think we've already seen this one.
               Harold changes the channel...

          ANGLE - TELEVISION
          It's an anti-marijuana commercial. Two teenagers are
          listening to rock music in a house without parents. One
          teenager (blonde) passes a joint to the other (brown haired).

                                 BLONDE HAIRED KID
                    Come on, dude. Just take one hit.       Don't
                    you want to be cool?
          Nervously, Brown Haired Kid takes a hit of the joint. Right
          after he exhales, he walks over to his DAD'S GUN RACK and
          takes out a LONG RIFLE...

                                 BLONDE HAIRED KID
                    Hey man, what are you doing?

                                   BROWN HAIRED KID
                    I'm so high!    Nothing can hurt me!
          The Brown Haired Kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth.
          We see Blonde Haired kid in slow motion go "Nooooo!" BANG!

          WE HEAR A GUNSHOT AS THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK...

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Marijuana kills.

          ANGLE -    HAROLD AND KUMAR
          They're laughing their asses off at the commercial.

                                 KUMAR
                    I love that shit!
          Harold continues flipping channels...

          ANGLE- TV
          We see a News report

                        (mock opening an envelope)
                 ...Harold Lee! Come on down! Take a bow!

                              HAROLD
                 Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie!
                 It's a classic! It's a beautiful story
                 about someone who feels unnoticed,
                 unappreciated, unloved...

                               KUMAR
                 Hey look!   It's you!
          Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN
          CANDLES--[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie]
          Kumar laughs.   Harold isn't amused.
          We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he
          does for the grandparents].

                              KUMAR
                 Hey, when are you gonna start doing some
                 chores around here?
          Harold gives Kumar a "don't even joke" look. He then
          violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it. Kumar
          laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke...

                              HAROLD
                 We're so high right now.

                              KUMAR
                 We're not low.

                              HAROLD
                 I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as
                 balls.

                                KUMAR
                 No shit!    Let's eat!
          HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that
          have been left on the floor...

                              KUMAR
                 Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight.

                              HAROLD
                 What about KFC?

                               KUMAR
                 Nah, we've been there too many times.
                        (beat)
                 I want something we haven't had in
                 awhile. Something different. Something
                 that'll really hit the spot. I want the
                 perfect food...

                      Are you hungry?
               HAROLD and KUMAR turn their attention to the TV, where they
               see A WHITE CASTLE COMMERCIAL taking place. In the
               commercial, we see DOZENS OF TINY BURGERS lined up in a row.

                                   VOICE ON TV
                      Then come to White Castle and try our
                      Slyder Special-- six burgers, fries, and
                      a soft drink for only 2.99.
               HAROLD and KUMAR start salivating, as they see THE STEAM RISE

               FROM THE BURGERS ON THE T.V.

                                   VOICE ON TV
                      Imagine all those burgers in your stomach
                      right now. Mmmmmh....
               HAROLD and KUMAR move closer to the TV to smell the burgers.

                                   VOICE ON TV
                      Don't you like food that's tasty and
                      delicious?
               Almost in a trance, HAROLD and KUMAR nod agreeingly.

                                   VOICE ON TV
                      Then what are you waiting for? Head over
                      to White Castle. It's what you crave.
               The commercial ends. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other--
               this is clearly an emotional moment for both of them.

          22   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - 7:45                        22
               HAROLD and KUMAR exit their apartment.

                                   HAROLD
                      You're sure you know how to get there?   I
                      haven't been to White Castle in ages.

                                   KUMAR
                      I'm telling you, there's one right around
                      the corner from that multiplex in New
                      Brunswick.
               They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment.
               On the side of the doorway is a MEZUZAH IN THE SHAPE OF A
               NAKED WOMAN. Harold and Kumar walk in without knocking...

               HAROLD and KUMAR walk into an apartment that looks almost
               identical to theirs. (Instead of a "BILLY MADISON" poster,
               there's one of "HAPPY GILMORE.")

          Sitting on the couch is ROSENBERG (a seemingly "nice Jewish
          boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and GOLDSTEIN (a more
          depraved Jewish boy, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the
          OLSEN TWINS-- underneath the picture we see the words,
          "FINALLY LEGAL ON JUNE 13, 2004"). Both of them are taking
          bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching TV as Harold    
          and Kumar enter...

                 Wait-- we're watching The Gift on HBO.

                               KUMAR
                 No waiting.   We're starving...
          Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing
          a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg & Goldstein's coffee
          table.

                              KUMAR
                        (scolding Harold)
                 ...Put that down! We're not eating `til
                 we get to White Castle.
          Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as
          soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and
          Goldstein, he slips it his pocket.

                 You would never think a sweet, innocent
                 girl like her would ever take her top
                 off. Which is precisely why we have to
                 watch her do it.

               HAROLD presses the "down" button. KUMAR notices that Harold
               has his LAPTOP BAG on his shoulder...

                      some of my work done in the car.
               Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty.

                                   KUMAR
                      Shit, I forgot my cell phone.

                                   HAROLD

               As Harold and Kumar enter, we hear a DOOR SLAM behind them.
               They turn around and see MARIA locking her door. She hasn't
               noticed Harold and Kumar yet.

                                   KUMAR

                Harold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the "door closed"
                button repeatedly. The door closes before Maria sees them.

                       her if she wanted to go to White Castle.
                Harold doesn't say anything.   He looks down in shame.

                                    KUMAR
                       You're worthless.

                       It doesn't matter. The only girls
                       interested in me are girls I have no

                       throwing a party at her dorm tonight.

          A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a

                 the manned booths and tell them what
                 happened.

          Kumar can't take it anymore. Just as Harold is about to get
          out of the car, Kumar hits the gas and screeches away.

          38   EXT. HIGHWAY                                                38
               We see Harold's Infiniti swerve onto the Newark EXIT...

          39   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI - 9:00 PM                            39
               HAROLD and KUMAR drive through the dangerous streets of
               Newark. They're very quiet, until Kumar breaks the silence.

                                   KUMAR
                      That was the last of our weed.

                                   HAROLD
                      Look, I get a little paranoid sometimes.

                                   KUMAR
                      Now we're in Newark of all places.    You
                      know we're gonna get shot.

                                   HAROLD
                      Maybe it's not as bad as they say.    It's
                      probably just a bunch of hype.
               They look out the window and see another ASIAN and INDIAN guy
               (Daniel and Shankar) walking down the street. Suddenly,
               THREE HOODS jump out from an alley and start beating the
               living shit out of Daniel and Shankar.
               Kumar gives Harold a dirty look.

                                   HAROLD
                      Let's get the hell out of here.
               KUMAR continues driving. He makes a turn. All of a sudden, he
               stops short, causing he and HAROLD to jerk forward quickly.

                                    HAROLD
                      What the...

          40   EXT. MARTIN LUTHER KING BLVD                                40
               Directly in front of Harold's Infiniti, A BASKETBALL GAME IS

               GOING ON BETWEEN A BUNCH OF HUGE BLACK DUDES, RIGHT IN THE
               MIDDLE OF THE STREET! (There are hoops on both sides.)
               The BASKETBALL PLAYERS briefly look over at Harold's Infiniti
               before continuing their game.

          41   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                      41

                                   HAROLD
                      Dude, we are NOT driving through that
                      basketball game!

                              KUMAR
                 We have to if we want to get out of here.
          Kumar points to a sign indicating that the HIGHWAY is ahead.

                              HAROLD
                 Forget about it. No way.

                              KUMAR
                 Come on. How do you know they're not
                 peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys?
          With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS
          HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently
          bumps chests with his teammates.

                              HAROLD
                 Turn the car around.

                              KUMAR
                 Why? Are cars not allowed to go through
                 when a game's going on? When we were
                 kids, we used to move to the side when we
                 were playing in the street.
          The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.

                              HAROLD
                 For some reason, I don't think this is
                 the same thing.

                              KUMAR
                 I'm going through.
          KUMAR begins inching forward.

                                HAROLD
                 Don't!
          The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside.

                                KUMAR
                 Look.    They're moving.   I told you.
          Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar,
          they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all
          times. Harold is scared shitless. He then notices the
          HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN holding the basketball.

                              HAROLD
                 Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us.

                              KUMAR
                 How do you know?

                                     HAROLD
                      Look at him!
               The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN has an ESPECIALLY ANGRY FACE.

                                     KUMAR
                      Oh fuck.
               KUMAR puts the pedal to the metal and ZOOMS AWAY FROM THEM.

          42   EXT. MARTIN LUTHER KING BLVD                                  42
               The BASKETBALL PLAYERS watch the car speed away. AFTER A

               COUPLE SECONDS, THEY ALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND START

               LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY! A RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER TURNS TO

               THE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN...

                                   RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER
                      Man, you scared the shit out of them!
                      Make that face again!

                                   HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN
                      Okay, okay, okay...
               THE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN suppresses his laughter and
               tries to make the face. He bursts out laughing again.

                                    HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN
                      Shit.   I can't do it.
               His friends laugh harder.      He tries to regain his composure.

                                    HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN
                      Hold up.   Hold up...
               He manages to make his angriest face for two seconds, before
               bursting out laughing again.

          43   EXT. HIGHWAY - 9:45 PM                                        43
               We see Harold's Infiniti back on the highway, driving fast...

                                   HAROLD
                      That was close, dude.

          44   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                        44
               KUMAR sees a HIGHWAY SIGN-- "NEW BRUNSWICK-- NEXT EXIT."

                                   KUMAR
                      Rold, check it out!      We're almost there!

                                     HAROLD
                      Yes!    Thank God! I'm starving!

               We see Harold's Infiniti take the exit...

          46   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (NEW BRUNSWICK) - 9:55 PM              46
               Harold's Infiniti drives down a street, loaded with mini-
               malls and fast food joints...

          47   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                      47
               HAROLD and KUMAR are looking for the White Castle...

                                   HAROLD
                      Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like
                      twenty of those burgers.

                                   KUMAR
                      I'll see your twenty and raise you five
                      orders of fries.

                                   HAROLD
                      God, where the hell is this place?

                                   KUMAR
                      Don't worry, we'll find it.
               HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead...

                                   HAROLD
                      There's the multiplex!

                                   KUMAR
                      That means the White Castle should be
                      just around the corner...

               HAROLD AND KUMAR'S MOUTHS DROP! INSTEAD OF WHITE CASTLE,

               THEY SEE A BURGER SHACK. THEY'RE IN TOTAL SHOCK.

                                   HAROLD
                      What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That
                      doesn't look like a White Castle to me!

                                   KUMAR
                      We gotta get to the bottom of this!

               KUMAR drives right up to the PICK UP WINDOW, where we see a
               chubby BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE...

          

                         DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   27.

          

          

                              BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                 I'm sorry. You have to order at the
                 drive thru menu...

                              KUMAR
                 What happened to the White Castle?

                               BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                 Excuse me?

                              KUMAR
                 There used to be a White Castle right in
                 this spot. Where is it?

                              BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                        (remembering)
                 Oh yeah. There was a White Castle here.
                 Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad
                 news, but Burger Shack bought this
                 location four years ago.
          HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, devastated.

                              KUMAR
                 Please tell me there's another White
                 Castle in town.

                               BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                 Nope.

                              HAROLD
                 Are you sure?

                              BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                 Do I look like the type of guy who would
                 be unsure about something like this?
          HAROLD and KUMAR are freaking out.

                               KUMAR
                 Shit.   What are we gonna do?

                              HAROLD
                 I don't know. Should we just eat here?

                              KUMAR
                 Do you really think that'll satisfy us?
          The BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE senses their desperation.

                              BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                 There's a 24 hour White Castle in Cherry
                 Hill, about forty-five minutes away.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Harold)
                 I can make the trip if you're willing to.

                              HAROLD
                 Kumar, I have a shitload of work to
                 finish. And you have that med school
                 interview in the morning.

                              KUMAR
                 Forget about the med school interview.
                 It's a non-issue.

                               BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                 If I may interject for a moment...
                        (beat)
                 I've been an employee here for three
                 years now, and if there's one thing I've
                 learned, it's that when you're craving
                 White Castle, the burgers here simply
                 won't cut it.
                        (in his own little world)
                 In fact, just thinking about those tender
                 little White Castle burgers and those
                 grilled onions makes me want to burn this
                 place to the ground and re-build a White
                 Castle in its place.
                        (back to reality)
                 If I were you, I'd suck it up and make
                 the trip.
          KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case.
          HAROLD is clearly torn. We sense that this is an important
          moment for the guys...

                              KUMAR
                        (enticing Harold)
                 You can always do your work in the car.
          HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.

                                HAROLD
                 Let's do it.

                              KUMAR
                 Then it's settled. No matter what, we're
                 not ending this night without White
                 Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?
          KUMAR puts his hand out.   HAROLD shakes it.

                                HAROLD
                 Agreed.

                      Wise choice. Besides, you wouldn't want
                      to go near our special sauce tonight.
                      Some of the guys and I added an extra
                      ingredient, if you know what I mean.
               HAROLD and KUMAR look confused.

                                   BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                      I'll give you a hint...
                             (whispering)
                      It's semen.
               We hear Harold and Kumar scream in disgust as Harold's
               Infiniti zooms out of the drive thru...

                                   KUMAR
                      White Castle, here we come. I just wish
                      we had some more pot. I'm almost
                      completely sober right now.
               HAROLD ignores this. He's TYPING FEVERISHLY ON HIS LAPTOP--
               trying to get his work done. Meanwhile, Kumar notices a sign
               on for the PRINCETON EXIT.

                                   KUMAR
                      Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here.
               Kumar takes the exit.

                                     HAROLD
                      Why?

                                   KUMAR
                      We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into
                      finding us some weed.

                                     HAROLD
                      Oh no.    I'm not seeing Cindy.

                                   KUMAR
                      Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the
                      phone all the time.

                                   HAROLD
                      She calls me. Then she rambles on about
                      her East Asian Students club or whatever.

                      And I have to pretend like I actually
                      give a shit, or she'll call me a twinkie.

                                    KUMAR
                      A twinkie?

                                   HAROLD
                      You know, yellow on the outside, white on
                      the inside.

                                   KUMAR
                      Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our
                      weed out the window, so now it's your
                      duty to make sure we're high as shit by
                      the time we're eating those burgers.

                                   HAROLD
                      Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy
                      doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us.

                                   KUMAR
                      As long as she buzzes us into a dorm,
                      we're set. Give me ten minutes in there
                      and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy.

                                   HAROLD
                      No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim.

          51   INT. CINDY KIM'S DORM ROOM - 11:OO PM                        51
               HAROLD is sitting on a bed, next to CINDY KIM (very cute,
               prim and proper, Korean girl). Sitting on the floor are A
               DOZEN ASIAN STUDENTS-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy
               clothes, etc). Harold is kind of creeped out by them.

                                   CINDY
                      I'm so glad you showed up, Harold!

                                  HAROLD
                            (unenthusiastic)
                      Yeah. Me too.

                                   CINDY
                      Did you like the Hibiscus petals I glued
                      to the envelope I sent you?

                                     HAROLD
                      Uh, yeah.    They were...nice.
               Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises
               his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to
               Cindy. "Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?"
               Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while...

                                   HAROLD
                             (to Kenneth)
                      Uh, yes?

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   31.

          

          

                              KENNETH
                 Kenneth Park. Class of 2004. Is it true
                 you're an analyst at Brewster Keegan?

                              HAROLD
                 Yeah, I'm a junior analyst.

                               KENNETH
                 Awesome!
          KENNETH high-fives with the nerdy Asian student next to him.
          He then raises his hand again. HAROLD rolls his eyes...

                               HAROLD
                 Yes?

                              KENNETH
                 Uh, this is actually a two-part question.
                 I'm applying for a summer internship at
                 Brewster Keegan, and I was wondering a)
                 what it's like being an investment banker
                 and b) if you would write me a
                 recommendation.

                              HAROLD
                 What it's like being an investment
                 banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's
                 pretty...
          HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian
          students. He can't bear to tell them the truth...

                               HAROLD
                 ...awesome?
          All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other.

                              HAROLD
                 As for the recommendation, I may be able
                 to make a call or two...
          CINDY looks at her watch...

                              CINDY
                 Actually Harold, we should be getting to
                 the party. We can discuss all this stuff
                 there. It's just down the hall.
          All the Asian students get up...

                              HAROLD
                 Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait
                 for Kumar...

                                    CINDY
                       You'll see him when we're done. Trust me,
                       you're gonna love this. Kenny's mom
                       dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae.
                Kenneth looks proud of himself.

                                     HAROLD
                       Nice.
                CINDY grabs HAROLD's hand and drags him away.

          52    INT. DORM HALLWAY - 11:15 PM                                 52
                KUMAR is standing in the hallway, accosting random students.
                He sees one RANDOM STUDENT walk by...

                                    KUMAR
                       Hey! You know where I can get some
                       chronic?
                The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated...

                                    KUMAR
                       What kind of Ivy League school is this?

          52A   EXT. PRINCETON DORM - 11:16 PM                             52A
                Kumar exits the dorm, and walks throughout the quad, asking
                random students for drugs. Eventually, a HIPPIE-LOOKING
                STUDENT (Phish t-shirt, Birkenstocks) taps KUMAR on the back.

                                    HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                       Heeey, Man. Lookin' to toke up?
                KUMAR breathes a sigh of relief...

                                    KUMAR
                       Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime
                       of your finest herb.
                The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A
                GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck...

                                    KUMAR
                       Oh my dear sweet lord...
                Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his
                hand away...

                                     HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                       Yo, man!   Not cool! This is my baby,
                       man!

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     33.

          

          
          Hippie Asshole sizes Kumar up and then gives Kumar him a
          measly dime bag...

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                 That'll be eighty bucks.

                              KUMAR
                 Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops,
                 bro!
          The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar.

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                 I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel
                 like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy
                 it. That's cool with me. I can find lots
                 of people who want to get high. I can
                 smoke it myself, man.

                              KUMAR
                 Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are
                 you?

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                 One who understands the concept of supply
                 and demand, dude.
          Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a
          couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes
          out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole.

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                        (laughing like a prick)
                 Dumbass.
          Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE,
          BLUE EYES, BIG BREASTS, BRITISH ACCENTS) approach carrying
          take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making
          their deal.

                              CHRISTY
                 Hey, you guys about to smoke?
          KUMAR and HIPPIE ASSHOLE turn and see THE TWINS.   They're
          both floored by their hotness.

                             HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                       (to the Twins)
                 Yeah. Wanna come back to my place?

                              KUMAR
                 Please. Like they want to go listen to a
                 bunch of Phish records while you read
                 your lame ass poetry.

                                bag of weed)
                        Ladies? Wanna get high and have some fun?
                CHRISTY and CLARISSA look at each other. They like this dude.

                           CHRISTY                           CLARISSA
                Sure!                           Sure!

                                     HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                               (butting in)
                        Hey, my poetry isn't lame! It's actually
                        quite good.
                The girls clearly aren't convinced. The ignore him and turn
                to Kumar. Hippie Asshole is oblivious to the fact he's not
                part of the crowd.

                                     CHRISTY
                               (re: bag of food)
                        We're just gonna eat before this gets

                        in our room in twenty minutes?

                                     CLARISSA
                        We're in room 109.

                                      KUMAR
                        109.   Got it. I'll see you later.

                                     HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                        Yeah, see you there.
                THE TWINS walk away. Kumar's excited. Hippie Asshole tries
                to pound fists with Kumar like they're all of a sudden
                friends. Kumar snubs him and runs off.

                                     HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                        Not cool, man.

                Kumar runs down the hall and finds HAROLD walking with CINDY
                and the ASIAN STUDENTS. He runs over to them...

                                     KUMAR
                        Rold! Rold! You gotta come quick!
                        There are these two filthy pussies who
                        are just aching to get boned by us.
                KUMAR notices that CINDY is appalled by his choice of words.

                                     KUMAR
                        Uh...I mean...there are two very lovely,
                        young pussies who would like to have a
                        chat with you and I.

                                     CINDY
                      Sorry.    Harold's coming with us.

                                   KUMAR
                      That's bullshit. He's coming with me.
                      Isn't that right, Rold?
               CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her.

                      Fuck that!
               KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room,
               and returns a few moments later dragging an ASIAN FRESHMAN in
               his pajamas. He pushes the Asian Freshman over to Cindy...

                                   KUMAR
                      Here-- this is Harold's understudy.     You
                      can do whatever you want with him.
                             (to Harold)
                      Let's go.
               KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY
               looks pissed as she watches HAROLD being taken away from her.

          53   INT. DORM HALLWAY (DIFFERENT WING) - 11:30 PM                53
               KUMAR takes the first puff of a joint.

                                   KUMAR
                      I can't believe you were gonna ditch me
                      for the Joy Luck Club. You know what
                      their parties are like.

                                   HAROLD
                      Look, what do you want me to say?     I was
                      under pressure.

                                   KUMAR
                      Just say "no"! That's all it takes.      Now
                      take a hit of this.
               Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens
               and a SECURITY GUARD enters the hall. He sees HAROLD and
               KUMAR with drugs.

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                      Hey, what are you two doing?!
               HAROLD and KUMAR start running down the hallway.

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                      Hey, get back here!
               HAROLD and KUMAR duck around the corner.     They see a door to
               the WOMEN'S BATHROOM.

                                     KUMAR
                      Quick.    In here.
               The guys rush into the WOMEN'S BATHROOM.

          54   INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM                                          54
               HAROLD and KUMAR try to decide where to hide.

                                     HAROLD
                      Shit!    What if he finds us?

                                   KUMAR
                      Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for
                      us in the women's bathroom.
               Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom.

                                     KUMAR
                      Shit!    Get in that stall!
               There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD
               RUNS INTO STALL NUMBER TWO (the middle one). KUMAR sees the
               BATHROOM DOOR START TO OPEN. He also runs into STALL NUMBER
               TWO and shuts the door behind him.
               The guys struggle to STAND ON THE TOILET BOWL.    Harold's
               laptop bag keeps smacking Kumar.
               CHRISTY and CLARISSA (THE TWINS) enter the bathroom.       They're
               in mid-conversation.

                                   CHRISTY
                      Hurry up, I want to go smoke pot with
                      that cute Indian bloke.

               INTERCUT:
               IN STALL NUMBER TWO, KUMAR'S ears perk up, as we see HAROLD
               and KUMAR both standing on the toilet bowl. From Kumar's POV,
               he sees CHRISTY and CLARISSA through the crack of the door.

                                   CLARISSA
                      It'll be a few minutes, I'm about to have
                      the worst case of the taco shits.
               KUMAR is clearly upset to hear this.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES      MAY 28 2003   37.

          

          

                              HAROLD
                        (whispering)
                 Ew...gross.
          CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door.
          The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to
          look over at that stall.

                               CHRISTY
                 Oh great.   Now I think I have to go.
          CHRISTY enters STALL NUMBER THREE and shuts the door.
          The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to
          turn their attention to the other stall. They then look at
          each other grossed out.
          From above, we see HAROLD and KUMAR struggling, while the
          girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls.

          WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF DIARRHEA HITTING THE BOWL.

                                CLARISSA
                 Ahhhhh!
          HAROLD and KUMAR look horrified.      There is silence for a few
          seconds until....

                              CHRISTY
                 Hey Clarissa. Do you wanna play battle
                 shits?
          We see HAROLD quizzically mouth "battle shits?"

                              CLARISSA
                 Oh my God. We haven't played that since
                 back in camp!
          HAROLD and KUMAR look confused.

          WE HEAR A LOUD FARTING NOISE, THEN THE SOUND OF SHIT HITTING

          THE WATER...

                                CHRISTY
                 Wait for it.    Wait for it.    Ahhhhh!

                                CLARISSA
                 Hit!
          HAROLD and Kumar look terrified.

          55   EXT. DORM COMMON ROOM                                        55
               Meanwhile, CINDY has left the other students and is roaming
               the hallways, looking for Harold. She sees Hippie Asshole
               walking by, counting Kumar's money...

                                   CINDY
                      Have you seen a Korean guy around here?

                                   HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                      Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of
                      them in this dorm.
                             (to himself, but audible)
                      `Tard.
               Cindy can't help but feel a little stupid.

          56   INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM                                        56
               We hear the sound of diarrhea splattering against the bowl.

                                    CLARISSA
                      Hit!
               We see HAROLD dry heave.
               We hear the sound of diarrhea hitting the bowl again.
               CLARISSA smiles.

                                   CHRISTY
                      You sank my destroyer! Scag!
               KUMAR almost pukes as HE DROPS THE POT INTO THE TOILET BOWL.

                                    HAROLD
                              (whispering)
                      Shit!

               THEY SEE THE MARIJUANA UNPROTECTED FLOATING IN THE TOILET.

               WE THEN HEAR THE MOST DISGUSTING DIARRHEA SOUND YET.

                                   HAROLD

                      I CAN'T TAKE THIS!
               With that, HAROLD runs out of the stall and exits the
               bathroom. The girls look shocked.

                                   CHRISTY
                      Who was that?
               KUMAR looks nervous. He quickly bolts from the bathroom.

                                   CLARISSA
                      Christy, are you still here?

                Silence until...We hear a SUPER LOUD FART.    CHRISTY starts
                laughing.

                                     CLARISSA
                       Damn!   You sank my battle shit!

          57    EXT. HALLWAY                                                   57
                Harold and Kumar run down the dorm hallway, grossed out.    As
                they run, they suddenly see--

          57A   INT. COMMON ROOM                                            57A
                Harold and Kumar stop in their tracks when they see the EAST
                ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in full blast. All the
                "nerdy" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each
                other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP.
                Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the
                dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot. Kenneth jumps off the
                couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT BROWNIES.

                                    KENNETH
                       Pot brownies for everyone!
                Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air. People grab at
                them. Harold and Kumar can't believe it.
                Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth...

                                     CUTE ASIAN CHICK #1
                       Hey, K-dog!   Can we have some brownies?

                                    KENNETH
                       To tell you the truth, I'm running low.
                       But a quick titty flash may persuade me.
                The Korean chicks look at each other. "Should we?" "Okay!"
                They lift up their shirts and bras, revealing their boobs.

                                    KUMAR
                       Dude, I'm starting to think you made a
                       mistake by not going to this party...
                Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY
                GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHER

                SECURITY GUARD (#2)--

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                       Hey, you!
                The guys turn and see the guards running at them. HAROLD AND

                KUMAR RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN DOWN THE HALLWAY, WITH THE

                GUARDS CHASING AFTER THEM...

               Further down the hall, they pass the party. The partygoers
               watch as the guys run by, except for Kenneth, who makes a
               quick grab at one of the topless girl's boobs. When she
               notices, Kenneth quickly looks away, as if he did nothing.
               Cindy Kim notices Harold...

                                     CINDY KIM
                      Harold!
               They keep running, past the bathrooms, where Christy and
               Clarissa exit...

                                     CHRISTY AND CLARISSA
                      Kumar!
               They continue running.
               The guards are still running after Harold and Kumar, who see
               the EXIT DOORS just ahead. Suddenly, the Hippie Asshole
               walks by, blocking their path.

                                   HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                             (to himself)
                      Where the hell is 109, man?
               Harold is about to avoid him, but Kumar grabs Harold close
               and the two of them BASH INTO THE Hippie Asshole-- KNOCKING

               HIM ON HIS ASS.
               Harold and Kumar burst out the doors and EXIT THE DORM...
               The Security Guards run by the Hippie Asshole, but stop when
               they see his backpack, which is half-open, and is exposing
               THE GIANT BAG OF WEED. The Security Guard picks it up...

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                      Well, well, well. What have we here?

                                   HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                             (reaching for the bag)
                      Aw, dude! Don't take it! It's mine!
               He continues to protest as SECURITY GUARD #2 holds him down.

          58   EXT. DARK ROAD (PRINCETON) -11:45 PM                         58
               Harold's car races down a road in the middle of a FOREST.

                                   KUMAR
                             (using his fingers)
                      I can't believe it. We were this close
                      to getting high and getting laid.

                                   HAROLD
                      Oh, come on, you always exaggerate.    We
                      weren't gonna get laid.

                                   KUMAR
                      Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex
                      with us! And what about Cindy?! She was
                      looking hot tonight! The fact that you're
                      not into her just might make you gay!

                                   HAROLD
                      I know Cindy's cute, it's just...

                                    KUMAR
                      What?   You'd rather have Maria?
               From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head.

                                   HAROLD
                      Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end
                      up with Cindy anyway. It's just more
                      practical. Now can we drop this and get
                      our asses to White Castle?

                                    KUMAR
                      Fine.
               Suddenly, KUMAR pulls the car over to the side of the road...

                                   HAROLD
                      Now what are you doing?

                                   KUMAR
                      Daddy needs to urinate.
               Harold rolls his eyes.

               KUMAR gets out of the car (leaving the car door open). He
               walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards
               until HE FINDS A NICE BUSH. HE UNZIPS HIS PANTS AND STARTS

               PEEING ON THE BUSH..

                                    KUMAR
                      Oh yes!   Yes, that's nice.

               As he types, A RACCOON JUMPS INTO THE CAR AND CRAWLS INTO THE
               BACK SEAT. HAROLD doesn't see this.

          62   EXT. BUSH NEAR DARK ROAD                                     62
               KUMAR is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF
               NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants
               and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR!
               Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The
               Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that
               Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple
               seconds, until he can't take it anymore...

                                   KUMAR
                      Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask
                      you...why are you peeing here?

                                   CREEPY GUY
                      What do you mean?

                                   KUMAR
                      Why did you decide to piss here right
                      next to me? Why not that bush over there?

                                   CREEPY GUY
                      Well, this looked like a good bush to pee
                      on. Why'd you choose this bush?

                                   KUMAR
                      Nobody was here when I chose this bush.

                                   CREEPY GUY
                             (getting heated)
                      So you can pee here and nobody else can,
                      is that it?

                                   KUMAR
                      I was just saying....

                                   CREEPY GUY
                      Is this like your special bush or
                      something?

                                    KUMAR
                      No, I just...
                             (beat)
                      You know what? Forget about it. I'm not
                      in the mood to get stabbed right now.
               The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate
               next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy
               Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package.

                                    CREEPY GUY
                      Nice pubes.

               KUMAR gets into the car and shuts the door.     He hits the gas
               and continues driving down the dark road...

                                   HAROLD
                      Do you even know where you're going?

                                   KUMAR
                      I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But
                      don't worry. Once we get on the highway,
                      we'll be there soon.

                                      HAROLD

               It starts to rain...

                      What's the big deal?

                      okay? After all the shit we've been                            
                      through tonight, I don't know how much
                      more of this I can take.

               AT THAT MOMENT, THE RACCOON JUMPS OUT FROM UNDER HAROLD'S

               SEAT, CRAWLS OVER THE LAPTOP, ONTO HIS CHEST, AND STARTS

               BITING HIS NECK...

                                      HAROLD

                      AHHHHH!!!     FUCK!!!!
               KUMAR turns and sees the raccoon on Harold.

                                      KUMAR
                      Holy shit!
               HAROLD tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck.     KUMAR
               tries to help him.

               HAROLD FINALLY GETS THE RACCOON OFF OF HIM. He holds it as
               far away from his face as possible. The raccoon's arms and
               legs are scurrying around-- trying to escape.

                                   KUMAR
                      How the hell did that get in here?

                                   HAROLD
                      Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have
                      rabies now or something!

                                 KUMAR
                           (looking at Harold's neck)
                    Don't worry. He didn't even break your
                    skin. You'll be fine.

          SUDDENLY, THE RACCOON COUGHS UP BLOOD ONTO HAROLD'S SHIRT.

                                 HAROLD
                    Oh, that's not good!

          HAROLD TURNS THE RACCOON AWAY FROM HIM.          THE RACCOON COUGHS

          UP BLOOD ONTO KUMAR.

                                 KUMAR
                    Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer
                    raccoon away from me!!!

          KUMAR SWERVES THE CAR IN A PANIC, AS HAROLD OPENS HIS WINDOW.

          KUMAR WATCHES AS HAROLD CHUCKS THE RACCOON OUT THE WINDOW.

                                 KUMAR
                    Thank Christ!
          Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF

          HEADLIGHTS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM!

                        HAROLD                                KUMAR
          Shit!!!                                Shit!!!
          KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD
          and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch
          nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins
          walking over to them.

                                   HAROLD
                    Uh-oh.
          KUMAR rolls down his window.         The DRIVER peers inside...

                                 GOLDSTEIN
                    What the hell do you think you were
                    doing? You almost killed us!
          GOLDSTEIN sees that it's HAROLD and KUMAR.

                                   GOLDSTEIN
                    Holy Shit!

                    Goldstein?
          HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief.

                           (to his car)

                      Oh no! No more detours! Let's just stick
                      with the plan and get to Krispee Kreme.

                      weird shit we've been through the last
                      couple hours.
               Harold and Kumar look at each other-- "if they only knew..."

               Kumar is sitting in the waiting room. He hides his head in a
               jittery manner, as if he's hiding from someone. Next to him
               are DANIEL and SHANKAR, who are both badly beaten and nursing
               their wounds. They all make eye contact. It's weird.

          Harold enters the room with a band-aid on his neck...

                              HAROLD
                 I don't have rabies.
          Kumar stands up quickly.

                              KUMAR
                 Great, let's get out of here.
          Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT...

                               MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (O.S.)
                 Kumar!!!
          Kumar know that voice all too well...

                               KUMAR
                 Shit.

          
          KUMAR turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS
          BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five
          years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire.

                              HAROLD
                 Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come
                 to the hospital.
          Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.

                              KUMAR'S FATHER
                        (thick accent)
                 I hope you are here to apologize for what
                 you did in your interview today. Dr.
                 Woodruff is a very good friend of mine,
                 and let's just say he was not at all
                 amused by your antics...and neither am I.

                              SAIKAT
                        (no accent)
                 What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar?
                 Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a
                 beamer. And I get laid whenever I want.
                 You can have all that too, if you'd just
                 get off your ass and go to med school.

                              KUMAR
                 Eat my balls, Saikat.

                              SAIKAT
                 God, you're 22 years old already! When
                 are you gonna grow up and stop with this
                 post-college rebel bullshit? Like your
                 life is so tough.
          Kumar doesn't have a response.   Saikat's right.

                              KUMAR'S FATHER
                 I will not tolerate this business from
                 you any longer. You have one more
                 interview tomorrow and it is the last one
                 I'm setting up for you.

                              KUMAR'S FATHER (cont'd)
                 If I hear from Dr. Wein that you were
                 anything short of spectacular, I'll
                 completely cut you off!

                              KUMAR
                 Oh, come on, dad!

                              KUMAR'S FATHER
                 "Daddy will not be coming on anything!"
                 You will be there and you will behave!
                 I've put too much time and effort into
                 you to let you go and fuck it all up.
          KUMAR lowers his head.   He's been put in his place.

                              KUMAR
                 You're right. I'm sorry.
          KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug.   He even gives SAIKAT a hug.

                              KUMAR
                 It won't happen again.

                               KUMAR'S FATHER
                 Good.   I'll speak with you tomorrow.
          KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he
          and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned...

                              HAROLD
                 Wow. So I guess you're going to med
                 school after all, huh?

                              KUMAR
                 Fuck that! Like I care what my dad
                 thinks. I can't wait to see the look on
                 his face when he finds out I skipped the
                 interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me
                 off? Fine! I don't need his money!

                              HAROLD
                        (extremely confused)
                 But...you just hugged him...

                              KUMAR
                 I just needed to get my hands on these...
          KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS.

                              KUMAR
                 Two words-- medical marijuana.
          HAROLD shakes his head in disgust.

          74A   INT. DOCTOR'S LOUNGE                                       74A
                Using the SCAN CARDS, Harold and Kumar walk into a room where
                there are loads of medical supplies, including SCRUBS. Kumar
                grabs a couple and hands one to Harold. They put them on...

                                    KUMAR
                       Look, I'm telling you, they see   an Indian
                       and Asian guy wearing these and   they'll
                       just assume we're doctors. Then   we walk
                       right into the pharmacy and get   the weed.
                Harold does not appear happy he's doing this.

          75    INT. HALLWAY                                                75
                HAROLD and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks)
                walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway...

                                    HAROLD
                       If we get caught, you're taking the
                       blame. This wasn't my idea.

                                    KUMAR
                       We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna
                       get toasted and then we're gonna eat
                       delicious White Castle-- just like we
                       planned.
                All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked
                out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled, touchy
                feely).

                                    MALE NURSE
                       Dr. Patel, thank God I found you!    I need
                       your help immediately!
                The NURSE drags them to a nearby emergency room...

          76    INT. EMERGENCY ROOM                                         76
                The scene is very fast paced, with several YOUNG MEDICAL
                TECHNICIANS rushing around. Harold is confused and concerned
                as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a patient...

                                    HAROLD
                              (whispering to Kumar)
                       What the hell's going on here?

                                    KUMAR
                       He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry.
                       Leave the talking up to me.
                On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST.
                He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   50.

          

          

                              MALE NURSE
                 The patient was brought in by EMS five
                 minutes ago. He has three gunshot wounds
                 with entry in the anterior abdomen. No
                 exit wounds.
          HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENT'S chest.

                               HAROLD
                 Oh shit!   This guy's gonna die!!!

          THE PATIENT HEARS THIS AND LOOKS NERVOUSLY AT HAROLD.

                              MALE NURSE
                 It's a good thing I found you two. All
                 the other surgeons are working on other
                 patients...
          The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument.

                              HAROLD
                 Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all
                 wrong. We're not doc...
          KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.

                              KUMAR
                 What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we
                 need to sedate the patient first or else
                 he could go into cardiac arrest.
          HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.

                              MALE NURSE
                 Alright. I'll get the anesthesiologist.
          The NURSE is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him.

                              KUMAR
                 Hold on. What we should probably use is
                 marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate
                 the patient for surgery.

                              MALE NURSE
                        (confused)
                 Marijuana? But why...

                              KUMAR
                 We don't have time for questions! We
                 need marijuana now! Get as much of it as
                 possible! Like a big bag of it!
          KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands.

          

                         DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   51.

          

          

                              MALE NURSE
                 But doctor, we don't have marijuana in
                 this hospital.
          HAROLD gives KUMAR a dirty look.

                               KUMAR
                         (to himself)
                 Shit.
          Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest.
          Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous...

                              MALE NURSE
                 We're losing him! You gotta do something!

                              KUMAR
                        (disappointed)
                 Very well. I guess we'll have to do this
                 the old fashioned way.
          KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face.
          Harold gives Kumar a look-- "What the fuck are you doing?"

                              KUMAR (CONT'D)
                 First, we need to clear his C-spine. I
                 want stat x-rays of the chest and
                 abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and
                 start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we
                 need 2 units of O neg on board.
          Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing
          bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe
          what's going on.
          Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's
          gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate
          begins speeding up to an insane pace.

                             MALE NURSE
                 Doctor! The patient is desatting!
          Kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...

                              KUMAR
                 Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed
                 lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat!
          After a couple seconds go by...

                              KUMAR
                 What's taking so long?

          

                             DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   52.

          

          
               The NURSE hands KUMAR what is essentially a LARGE NEEDLE!
               Kumar directs the needle in the direction of the Patient's
               chest. It's a tense moment. The Patient is scared. So is
               Harold. The Nurse looks hopeful. Kumar looks determined.
               With a quick thrust, Kumar jabs the needle into the Patient's
               chest, causing a rush of air! The Patient breathes easier.
               His heart rate drops back to normal.

                                   MALE NURSE
                      Great catch doctor! His sat is up to 94!
               Kumar is cool and collected. He turns to the YOUNG MEDICAL
               TECHNICIANS who have been aiding the surgery.

                                   KUMAR
                             (casual)
                      Will one of you guys put the chest tube
                      in and wrap this up?
               A chorus of "yes, doctors."

                                   KUMAR
                             (taking off his gloves)
                      Well, it looks like my work here is done.
               Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his
               face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous.
               He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT, who is just
               barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits...

                                   KUMAR (CONT'D)
                      Say, you wouldn't happen to know the
                      quickest way to get to the White Castle
                      in Cherry Hill from here, do you?

          77   EXT. TOWN STREETS - 1:00 AM                                  77
               Harold's car is cruising down some streets lined with stores.

          78   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       78
               Harold is very excited. Kumar is proud of himself, but
               playing it cool.

                                   HAROLD
                      I'm telling you. That was amazing!    Even
                      your dad would've been impressed!

                                   KUMAR
                             (nonchalant)
                      Yeah. It wasn't bad.

                       HAROLD
          This is perfect! We're back on the road.
          We have directions now. The rain let up.                
          And guess what...

          HAROLD clicks on the "SAVE" option on his laptop...

                               HAROLD
                 I'm officially done with my work.
                        (beat)
                 I'm telling you, things are finally
                 starting to go our way.
          While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his
          surroundings and notices something...

                              KUMAR
                 Hey, check it out!     Your movie's playing.
          Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater
          we see: "JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00.

          SIXTEEN CANDLES - 11:00.

                              KUMAR
                 And look who went to see it...
          Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA
          standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it.

                               HAROLD
                 Holy shit.

                              KUMAR
                 You see? You thought you two had nothing
                 in common. But it turns out you both
                 have the same lame taste in movies. Hey,
                 you wanna see if she wants to come with
                 us to White Castle?

                                HAROLD
                 No way.    Forget about it.   Just drive.
          Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his
          undivided attention.

                              KUMAR
                 Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an
                 hour from home. And who do we see, but
                 your dream girl standing outside a
                 theater playing your favorite movie. I
                 mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic
                 comedy, and I was your annoying gay
                 friend, this would be the moment I'd tell
                 you "this is a sign."

                               HAROLD
                 Stop it.

                              KUMAR
                 Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy
                 Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina
                 Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you
                 yourself said things are starting to go
                 our way...

                              HAROLD
                 Let's just go!
          KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN.

                              HAROLD
                 What are you doing?!

                              KUMAR
                        (calling out)
                 Hey Maria!
          MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN

          REACHES DOWN WITH HIS HAND TO HIT THE GAS PEDDLE. THE CAR

          STARTS PEELING OUT...

                              KUMAR
                 Hey, get your hand off the gas!
          Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas.   Just then,

          THE CAR BEGINS SHAKING INTENSELY...

                              KUMAR
                        (looking up)
                 Oh shit!
          Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING

          DOWN A DIRT AND ROCK COVERED HILL.
          KUMAR grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car
          safely. HAROLD is bumping around on the way down the hill.
          Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD.

                              HAROLD
                 You asshole! My car's probably all
                 scratched up now!

                              KUMAR
                 Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us
                 off the road!

                              HAROLD
                 I told you I didn't want to speak to her!
                        (composing himself)
                 Whatever. Let's jut get back on the
                 highway.

                                    KUMAR
                      Fine.
               KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a "POP!"   Harold and
               Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated.

          79   EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - 1:15 AM                               79
               HAROLD examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby.
               There's not another car in site.

                                   HAROLD
                      Godammit. You know how to change a flat?

                                   KUMAR
                      Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know
                      how to change a tire.
               Harold looks in his trunk for the spare.    It's missing.

                                   HAROLD
                      Where's my spare tire?

                                   KUMAR
                      I don't know.

                                   HAROLD
                      Shit, where the hell is it?
               Kumar suddenly remembers...

                                   KUMAR
                      Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we
                      got baked and started throwing shit off
                      that bridge to see if it would float?

                                   HAROLD
                      What bridge? What the hell are you
                      talking about?

                                   KUMAR
                             (realizing)
                      Oh shit. That's right. I was with
                      Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day.
                      My bad.

                                    HAROLD
                      Your bad?   What are the hell are we gonna
                      do now?!
               Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their
               direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops
               in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins
               walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon
               as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES.

               It's the UGLIEST MAN OF ALL TIME-- he's in his fifties,
               wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, HE HAS LARGE
               BUMPS AND BOILS ALL OVER HIS FACE. Harold and Kumar jump
               back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him.

                                   UGLY MAN
                      You boys need some help?
               The UGLY MAN takes off his mesh cap. Even his haircut is
               freaky. He has a SKULLET (A MULLET BUT WITH NO HAIR ON TOP).
               HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, freaked out.

          80   EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:20 AM                                    80
               The UGLY MAN'S TRUCK tows Harold's Infiniti down a dirt road.

               The UGLY MAN is driving. KUMAR is in the front seat, on the
               passenger side. HAROLD is sandwiched between them.

                                   HAROLD
                      Thanks for helping us out.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded
                      there and thought to myself, "what would
                      Jesus do?"
               Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a
               JESUS CHRIST bobble-head doll on the dashboard...

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      So, you boys worship Christ?
               The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.

                            HAROLD                           KUMAR
               Uh...Yeah.                        Sure, he's great.

                                   UGLY MAN
                      Great. Good to hear it. The name's
                      Randy...but everyone calls me Freak Show.

                                   KUMAR
                      I'm Kumar. This is Harold.     Good to meet
                      you, Mr...Freak Show.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      Pleasure's all mine.
               After a while, HAROLD starts to notice that they're driving
               in the middle of a dark woods. It looks very sketchy.

                                   HAROLD
                      So where exactly are we going?

                              FREAK SHOW
                 Don't worry. My place isn't too far from
                 here. Once we get there, I'll have your
                 ride fixed up in a jiffy.
          The guys silently continue driving, until KUMAR notices a

          RASH OF BOILS ON FREAK SHOW'S NECK.

                              KUMAR
                        (whispering to Harold)
                 Eww-- check out those boils on his neck!
          HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at
          FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.

                              KUMAR
                        (whispering)
                 Oh my God! You gotta look!     One of
                 them's actually pulsating!

                              HAROLD
                        (whispering)
                 Will you shut up? He's right next to me!
                 He can hear you!
          KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL.

                              KUMAR
                        (whispering)
                 Now there's some sort of puss! It's the
                 most disgusting thing I've ever seen!

                              HAROLD
                        (whispering)
                 What's the matter with you? You think
                 that just because you're whispering, he
                 can't hear what you're saying? He's two
                 feet away from us. He can hear this
                 entire conversation. He can hear me
                 talking right now.

                              KUMAR
                        (whispering)
                 Don't worry, he can't hear anything.    Not
                 with all that crust in his ear.
          HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then
          looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard
          a thing. Harold seems relieved.

                              FREAK SHOW
                 I heard every word you said.
          FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't
          know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact
          that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.

               HAROLD (with laptop in tow) and KUMAR stand by their car, as
               FREAK SHOW brings out some tools and a new tire from his
               house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere.

                                     FREAK SHOW
                        Now it's gonna take me a little while
                        here, so if you boys like you can go
                        inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have
                        something to drink, watch tv-- anything
                        you want. Mi casa es su casa. Just
                        don't do anything Jesus wouldn't do.
               FREAK SHOW gives HAROLD a pat on the back and starts changing
               the tire. KUMAR and HAROLD look at each other. Slowly, they
               walk towards FREAK SHOW's house...

                                     KUMAR
                        Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck
                        his wife?

                                     HAROLD
                        He couldn't have said that.

                                     KUMAR
                        But he did! It may have been in mid-
                        sentence, but it was still clear as day.
               They reach the front door and are about to enter...

                                     HAROLD
                        Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What
                        do you think his wife is gonna look like?

          83   INT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE                                      83
               HAROLD and KUMAR walk inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL
               TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy
               Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.

                                     LIANE
                        Hi. I'm Freak Show's wife, Liane.    Would
                        you boys like some pink lemonade?
               HAROLD and KUMAR can't move.   They're awestruck.

                                     LIANE
                        Let me go bring in a pitcher.
               LIANE   leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she
               turns   on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG
               ABOUT   JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house.
               There   are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with
               Freak   Show and Liane's wedding picture...

                              HAROLD
                 Okay. It's official.     We've entered the
                 Twilight Zone.

                              KUMAR
                 Dude, Liane is fucking hot!

                              HAROLD
                 She's not ugly.
          LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade.    She pours them
          drinks and hands them the glasses...

                               KUMAR
                 Thanks.
                        (beat)
                 So, tell me Liane-- how are things
                 between you and Freak Show presently?

                              LIANE
                 Oh, never been better.    We love each
                 other very much.
          KUMAR looks disappointed.    HAROLD, however, is intrigued...

                              HAROLD
                 Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak
                 Show...end up with a woman like yourself?

                              LIANE
                 Well, I met him at choir practice `bout
                 four years ago. Freak Show was very shy
                 back then-- you know, because of all the
                 hideous boils on his face and neck. But
                 he had the most amazing voice -- like a
                 baby canary.
          Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we
          talking about the same Freakshow?"

                              LIANE
                 Well, one day after Easter service, I
                 told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and
                 he just mustered up some courage and
                 asked me out. The rest is history. And
                 we've been in love ever since.
          HAROLD ponders this for a moment.    He and KUMAR begin
          drinking their lemonade.

                              LIANE
                 So you boys gonna fuck me or what?
          HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They
          look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold.

                              KUMAR
                 Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes
                 first?

                              HAROLD
                 Wait a second-- what about Freak
                 Show...and this whole Christian thing you
                 guys have going on?

                              LIANE
                        (a little offended)
                 Oh, so just because we're passionate
                 about our Lord, you assume we don't know
                 how to have a good time?

                              HAROLD
                 No, I just...
          Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and
          Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window,
          where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.

                               HAROLD
                 Nevermind.
                        (to Kumar, swinging his
                         hand)
                 Okay, rock, paper, scissors...

                              LIANE
                 Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do
                 me at the same time.

                              HAROLD
                 Huh?

                               LIANE
                 Come on.   Give me the double stuff.
          HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused.

                              KUMAR
                 I'm not sure we quite understand...

                              LIANE
                 I want you both inside me simultaneously.
          HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and
          kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE...

                              KUMAR
                 Um, are we talking about one hole or two?

                              LIANE
                 However you want to do it.

                              HAROLD
                 Sorry, no thank you.

                               KUMAR
                        (to Harold)
                 Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad.
                        (beat)
                 Shotgun anus!

                              HAROLD
                 Forget it! I don't want our balls
                 rubbing against each other. No way!
          KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation...

                              KUMAR
                 What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow
                 jobs!?

                              LIANE
                 Well...okay.
                        (to Harold)
                 Can you help me with this...?
          Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous
          and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and
          puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar,
          who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the
          cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her
          shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her
          breasts.

                              LIANE
                        (to Harold, re: breasts)
                 Do you want to play with them?
          Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...

                              HAROLD
                 Okay, let's do that.
          Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts.
          Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold
          starts to massage her chest.
          AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a
          particularly threatening TIRE-IRON...

                              FREAK SHOW
                 Hey boys-- I changed your tire...
          FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE...

                              FREAK SHOW
                 What the hell are you doing with my wife!

                                   HAROLD
                             (scared shitless)
                      Uhh...you said outside that we can have
                      sex with her!
               FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar!

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      I most certainly did not say that!

                                    KUMAR
                      No.   You did. We both heard you.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                             (calming down)
                      Are you sure?

                                    KUMAR
                      Positive.
               FREAK SHOW ponders this.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      Oh...my mistake then.

                                    KUMAR
                      No problem.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      Well, since we're all here, why not make
                      it a foursome?

               FREAK SHOW PULLS HIS PANTS DOWN AND PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND

               HAROLD AND KUMAR...

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      Who wants the first reach-around?

               HAROLD and KUMAR burst out the front door and run towards
               their car. They get in and peel out as fast as they can.

          85   EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:45 AM                                     85
               Harold's Infiniti is driving down a dusty trail in the woods.

          86   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       86

                                   KUMAR
                      Okay, let's agree never to talk about
                      what just happened.

                                    HAROLD
                      Agreed.

               KUMAR searches for some clue of where they are.

                                   KUMAR
                      Dude, I have no idea where we are.
               All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead.

                                   KUMAR
                      Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up?

                                   HAROLD
                      And get chopped to bits?     Are you crazy?
               Kumar pulls over to the side of the road...

                                   KUMAR
                      Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know
                      how to get us back on the highway.

                                   HAROLD
                      Fuck that! It's my car! We're not
                      picking up a hitchhiker!
               The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car.

                                   NEIL
                      Yo, man, thanks for picking me up.
               HAROLD and KUMAR look at NEIL and then look at each other.
               THEY ARE IN COMPLETE SHOCK. Harold is no longer angry.

                                   HAROLD
                             (to Neil)
                      Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil
                      Patrick Harris?

                                      NEIL
                      Yep.

                                   KUMAR
                      Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was
                      my favorite TV show growing up! You were
                      my idol!

                                    NEIL
                             (curt)
                      Hey, that's great. Do you think we could
                      get going? I'm bored as shit back here.

                                   KUMAR
                      So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you
                      ever get it on with Wanda off the set?

                                   NEIL
                      Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on
                      that show.

                                   KUMAR
                      Even the chick who played the hot nurse?

                                   NEIL
                      No, I didn't go all the way with her.

                                   HAROLD
                      Hey, you don't know how to get back on
                      the highway, do you?

                                   NEIL
                      I don't even know where the fuck I am
                      right now. I was at this party earlier
                      tonight, and this dude hooked me up with
                      some killer X. Somehow I ended up
                      getting thrown out of a moving car, and
                      I've been tripping balls ever since.
               HAROLD and KUMAR both find this to be quite strange.

                                   KUMAR
                      Well, our night's been pretty crazy too.
                      We've been driving around for hours,
                      trying to get to White Castle, but we
                      keep getting sidetracked.

                                   NEIL
                      Dude, forget White Castle.   What we need
                      is some pussy.

                                   HAROLD
                      Huh?

                                   NEIL
                      It's a fucking sausage fest in here.
                      Let's get us some poon-tang. Then we'll
                      go to White Castle.

                                   KUMAR
                      You don't understand, Neil. We've been
                      craving these burgers all night.

                                   NEIL
                      I've been craving burgers too.   Fur
                      burgers, that is.

                                   (MORE)

                      Let's pick up some trim at a strip club.
                      The Doogie line always works on
                      strippers.
               HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- weirded out.

                                   KUMAR
                      Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop
                      and get directions.
               KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET
               leading up to a gas station in the distance...

          89   EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE - 1:50 AM                  89
               HAROLD and KUMAR get out of the car.   NEIL is still in the
               backseat. The car is still running.

                                   HAROLD
                      We'll be right back, Neil.
               NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start
               walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE.

                                   HAROLD
                      What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
                      Why's he so horny?

                                   KUMAR
                      I don't know. But we can't let him
                      interfere with our quest.
               Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have
               to jump out of the way. Cole parks the jeep and exits with

               TWO OF THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS.

                                   COLE
                      Late night math league meeting, homos?

                                   EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                             (to Cole)
                      Extreme!

                                   HAROLD
                             (upset)
                      Oh shit. These idiots.
               Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk
               into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them...

          90   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE                                        90
               HAROLD and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and
               the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from
               the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a
               HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS
               SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests...

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    66.

          

          

                              INDIAN CASHIER
                        (to Cole and the punks)
                 Please...the pies...do not...
          Cole and the Punks ignore him.    Harold and Kumar then
          approach the Indian Cashier...

                              HAROLD
                 Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get
                 onto the highway from here?
          The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Harold)
                 He probably can't speak English...

          KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE
          CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the
          directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to
          explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It
          sounds like it's very complicated.
          Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO
          MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK
          AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store.
          Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the
          CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches
          nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...

                              KUMAR
                 Who knew that learning Hindi would
                 actually pay off? The guy says the
                 highway's just down the road. We should
                 be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes.
          HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...

                               HAROLD
                         (to Kumar)
                 Huh?   Oh, good.

                              COLE (O.S.)

                 EXTREME KAYAKING!!!
          HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and
          look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY

          THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH

          THE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR...
          In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid-
          air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS,

          GLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC.
          The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR,
          and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief.

          

                          DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003    67.

          

          
          The kayak lands on the floor.     COLE gets out and celebrates
          with his friends.

                                 COLE
                    That was so fucking extreme, man!

                                 EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                    Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten--
                    one being not so extreme, ten being
                    extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine
                    point five.
          Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy
          throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves,
          bothering other customers.
          The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI.
          Extreme   Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of
          various   kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an
          other.    Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS.
          He goes   apeshit over his find.

                                 EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                    Extreme Cheddar!
          He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth,
          getting the chips all over the place.
          The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling.      Cole picks up the
          Cashier...

                                 COLE
                    Extreme Cashier!!!
          Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER
          around and around.

                                 HAROLD
                    Somebody should do something.

                                 KUMAR
                           (to Cole)
                    Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy
                    alone and go jerk off to some
                    snowboarding videos or something.

                                  EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS
                    Oooooooooh!
          Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the
          floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get
          their asses kicked.

          

                              DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   68.

          

          

                                   HAROLD
                             (to Kumar)
                      I didn't mean you should do something.
               Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face.
               Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior.
               It's a tense moment.
               Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit
               Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground
               without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks
               don't know what to think as their leader is shown up.
               Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as
               if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back,
               doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard,
               this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...

                                    KUMAR
                              (pissed off at himself)
                      Shit.
               Cole and the Punks burst out laughing.

                                   COLE
                      Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking
                      with me one more time. Just try it!
               Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest.

                                   KUMAR
                             (to Kumar, embarrassed)
                      Come on, lets get out of here.
               Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated.   With their
               leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating.

                                   COLE
                             (like Apu)
                      Thank you, come again!

          91   EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE                           91
               HAROLD and KUMAR walk back towards their car...

                                   HAROLD
                      Kumar-- you okay?

                                    KUMAR
                      Yeah, I just hate those dicks.
                             (beat)
                      Fuck it. At least now we know where we're
                      going. I'm so friggin' hungry...

               SUDDENLY, WE HEAR A CAR ENGINE START.    HAROLD AND KUMAR STOP

               WALKING AND LOOK OVER AT KUMAR'S CAR.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   69.

          

          THEY SEE NEIL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, TURNING THE KEY. THEY

          WATCH AS HE PUTS THE CAR INTO DRIVE, HITS THE GAS, AND TAKES

          OFF, DRIVING THROUGH A SIGN, AND GETTING ON THE ROAD...
          Harold and Kumar stand there for fifteen seconds, without
          saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the
          distance. Eventually, Harold breaks the silence...

                               HAROLD
                        (calm)
                 Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking
                 car?

                              KUMAR
                 I think he did.

                              HAROLD

                 FUCK!!!!!!
                        (to Kumar)
                 You! You had to pick up a hitchhiker!

                              KUMAR
                 Rold, calm down!

                              HAROLD
                 Why the hell did you leave the keys in
                 the car?!

                              KUMAR
                 I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a
                 trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to
                 know that he'd fuck us over?

                              HAROLD
                 This is all your fault! This whole
                 fucking night! You know I leased that
                 car! They're gonna make me pay for it!
          Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.

                              KUMAR
                 Where are you going?

                              HAROLD
                 I'm going to call the police!   I don't
                 want to talk to you anymore!
          Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and
          throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face.
          "Extremes" all around!

                              KUMAR
                 There's a pay phone across the street, if
                 you don't want to deal with those
                 assholes.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   70.

          

          
          Harold turns around and walks back towards the street. Kumar
          walks with him, keeping his distance. They reach the street.
          On the other side, he sees AN ORANGE "DON'T WALK" SIGN LIT
          UP. Harold presses the "WALK" BUTTON on the post next to him.

                              KUMAR
                 So after you talk to the cops we're still
                 going to White Castle, right?

                              HAROLD
                 I'm not speaking to you.
          Harold waits for the "DON'T WALK" sign to change. It
          doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE "WALK" BUTTON REPEATEDLY.

                              KUMAR
                 You know, pressing the button a bunch of
                 times doesn't make the sign change any
                 faster. The computer responds to the
                 first press. Every press after that is
                 extraneous.

                              HAROLD
                 Thank you, Mr. Wizard.
          HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't
          change, he begins pressing the button again.

                              HAROLD
                 Jesus Christ! When are they gonna
                 fucking develop button technology that'll
                 understand urgency?
          The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the
          left and then to the right. The street is completely empty
          and there is no place for a police car to hide.

                              KUMAR
                 This is ridiculous.   Just walk across.

                              HAROLD
                 It'll change in a second.
          They stand there for another ten seconds.   It doesn't change.

                              KUMAR
                 Come on, there's not a car in sight!

                              HAROLD
                 Alright fine. You want me to cross?
                 I'll cross. Just leave me alone!
          Harold starts walking angrily across the street.

                              KUMAR
                 Finally.

          

                         DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   71.

          

          
          Before Kumar has a chance to follow, a POLICE CAR FROM OUT OF

          NOWHERE FLASHES ITS LIGHTS AND STOPS HAROLD DEAD IN HIS

          TRACKS.

                               HAROLD
                 Shit!
          Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as
          OFFICER PALUMBO (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the
          car and walks over to them...

                              HAROLD
                        (looking at cop's name-
                         tag)
                 Good evening. Is there a problem,
                 Officer...Palumbo?

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Is there a problem? Ever hear of
                 jaywalking?

                              HAROLD
                 Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise
                 I'll never do it again.

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Yeah, like I give a fuck. I'm writing
                 you up a ticket.
          OFFICER PALUMBO begins writing a ticket.    Kumar walks over,
          flabbergasted...

                               KUMAR
                 A ticket?!   Are you serious?
          Harold motions Kumar to "shut the fuck up!"

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                        (to Kumar, unthreatened)
                 Who the fuck are you, shitwad?

                              HAROLD
                        (stepping in front of
                         Kumar)
                 Let me apologize for my friend. I promise
                 I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm
                 glad you're here. You know the TV show
                 Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie
                 Howser just stole my car and...

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Pipe down and give me your ID.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Officer Palumbo)
                 Wait. Hold on.

                              KUMAR (cont'd)
                 How can you give him a ticket for
                 jaywalking? I mean, look at this street!
                 He wasn't causing traffic or anything!

                              HAROLD
                 Kumar, shut up...

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                        (to Kumar)
                 Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on
                 a cop who could bust your ass.

                              KUMAR
                 Bust my ass?!

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass.
                        (to Harold)
                 What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with
                 like three o's and shit. What happened to
                 good old fashioned American names like
                 Dave, Jim...
          Harold points to his ID.

                              HAROLD
                 Harold.
          Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo.

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Yes. Harold. That's a great name.    You
                 should be proud of that name, son.

                              HAROLD
                 Thank you.
          OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk
          away.

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 As you were, ladies.
          Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it.

                              KUMAR
                 220 dollars!? Are you crazy?
          Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.

                              HAROLD
                 Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't...

                              KUMAR
                        (to Officer Palumbo)
                 No, no, no. I understand what's going on.

          

                             DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   73.

          

          
               Harold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block
               him. Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement
               towards him.

                                   OFFICER PALUMBO
                      Hey, hands down! No sudden moves!
               Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with
               Palumbo improvising little responses.

                                   KUMAR
                      Let me guess. You were probably the big
                      asshole in your high school, right?
                      You'd pick on guys like us every day.
                      But then graduation came, and we went to
                      college and you went nowhere, so you
                      thought, "How can I still give them shit?
                      I know! I'll become a cop!" Well,
                      congratulations. Your dream's come true.
               Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed.
               Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to
               Palumbo.

                                   KUMAR
                             (to Officer Palumbo)
                      Hey, while you're at it, why don't you
                      write him up another ticket? Or better
                      yet, arrest him. Lock him up!
               With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees
               Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends
               up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!

                                      HAROLD
                      Oh shit.

          92   INT. JAIL CELL - 2:30 AM                                    92
               The CELL DOOR SLAMS.    Harold is behind bars.

                                   HAROLD
                             (calling out)
                      Hey, are you gonna do something about my
                      car? Hello?
               Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE
               ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check.

                                   OFFICER PALUMBO
                      Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your donation
                      to our Police Charity is very
                      appreciated.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     74.

          

          

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S MOM
                 Well, thank you for being so
                 understanding about Bradley. I promise
                 you he won't ever do it again.

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the
                 talk we had, right Brad?
          Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look.

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                        (shaken)
                 Mom-- please take me home...
          The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a
          frightened child.
          Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we
          see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's
          WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on
          Harold...
          Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars...

                              HAROLD
                 Can I at least give you my car's licence
                 plate number?
          Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...

                              RADIO   ANNOUNCER
                 The search for the   escaped cheetah
                 continues tonight.   It was last spotted in
                 Randolph Township,   heading South...
          Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him
          is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold
          sits down, across from Tarik.
          While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the
          cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it.

                              HAROLD
                 So what are you in here for?

                              TARIK
                 For being black.

                               HAROLD
                 Come on.   Seriously.
          TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his
          Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.

          

                         DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   75.

          

          

                              TARIK
                 I am serious. You wanna know what
                 happened?
          Harold nods.

                              TARIK
                 I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble,
                 and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black
                 man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore,
                 since I'm black, it was probably me,
                 right?
          Harold shrugs his shoulders.

                              TARIK
                 Well that was the logic the cop used. I
                 told him I haven't even been to Newark in
                 months. Then he pointed a gun at me and
                 told me to stop resisting arrest. I
                 said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything."
                 So he starts beating me with his gun,
                 screaming at me, telling me to stop
                 resisting.

                               HAROLD
                 Holy shit.   What did you do?

                              TARIK
                 I kept saying, "I understand that I'm
                 under arrest. Please stop beating me."
                 But that didn't work. Then another cop
                 showed up. Then another. When it was
                 all said and done, it took nine cops to
                 bring me in here.

                              HAROLD
                 That fucking blows!
          Tarik nods and continues reading his book.    Harold sees that
          Tarik is remarkably relaxed.

                              HAROLD
                 I don't understand how you're able to be
                 so calm about all this.

                               TARIK
                 Son, I'm fat. I'm black. I can't dance.
                 And I have two gay fathers. I've had
                 people messing with me my whole life.
                        (beat)
                 I learned a long time ago, there's no
                 point in getting all riled up every time
                 a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time.
                 Because in the end, the universe tends to
                 unfold as it should.

          

                             DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   76.

          

          
               Harold takes this all in.

                                   TARIK
                      So what are you in here for?

                                   HAROLD
                      Assaulting an officer.

                                   TARIK
                      They tried to pin that shit on you too?

                                   HAROLD
                      No. I actually did hit the cop. But
                      only because I was trying to hit my
                      friend. Well, ex-friend.

          
               Suddenly, OFFICER REILLY hangs up the phone on his desk. He
               shouts out to the other officers in the room:

                                   OFFICER REILLY
                      Hey, listen up guys! Multiple gun shots
                      fired in Millbrook Park! It sounds bad!

                                   OFFICER PALUMBO
                      Finally, some action! I'm going!
               Another cop, OFFICER MARTONE, gets up...

                                   OFFICER MARTONE
                      No-- I'm going!
               All six officers in the room jump out of their desks and run
               for the door. Harold and Tarik can't believe it.

          93   EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS                            93
               We see the officers get into their POLICE CARS and drive off.

          94   INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS                                 94
               Harold and Tarik are now left all alone in their cell.

                                   HAROLD
                      That was strange.
               Suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a VENTILATION
               SHAFT on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks.

                                   HAROLD
                      What the hell was that?

                                  KUMAR (O.C.)
                            (from inside the shaft)
                      Rold? Is that you?

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   77.

          

          
          Although his voice is muffled, we can hear Kumar's words.
          Tarik is very confused.

                              HAROLD
                        (shouting out)
                 Kumar?! What the fuck are you doing?!

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 Are the cops still there?

                               HAROLD
                 No, they...   Wait a second, did you...

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 I called and made up some story about a
                 shooting in Millbrook park...

                              HAROLD
                 Jesus Christ! What did you do that for?!

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust
                 you out, and we'd get over to White
                 Castle.

                              HAROLD
                 Forget it! I don't want to get in any
                 more trouble! I'm already in here because
                 of you!

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 Hey, fuck you! What did you want me to
                 do? Stand there and take the hit? You
                 know, I've never taken a swing at you
                 before. Never.

                              HAROLD
                 Well, I never got your car stolen!

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 Look, Rold, I'm sorry. But you're not
                 the only one dealing with shit. My dad's
                 cutting me off, remember?

                              HAROLD
                 Hey asshole, I'm in jail! Don't bitch to
                 me about your problems! Just leave me
                 alone. I don't want your help.

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 You don't want my help? Fine!    I'm outta
                 here!

          We hear a couple banging sounds from the ventilation shaft.
          Then a couple more. Then a couple more. Pouting, Harold
          pretends to ignore it.

                                KUMAR (O.C.)
                 Uh...Rold?    How do I get out of here?
          Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.

                              HAROLD
                 How the hell should I know?

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 This isn't good.
          We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE

          VENTILATION SHAFT BREAKS OFF THE CEILING AND KUMAR FALLS OUT

          ONTO THE GROUND...

                              HAROLD
                 Jesus Christ.
          Tarik shakes his head.

                                KUMAR
                 Ow...my ass.
          Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell.

                              KUMAR
                 You sure you don't want to get out?

                              HAROLD
                 And become a fugitive? Are you nuts?
                 The guy has all my information.
          Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report,
          Harold's I.D., and his laptop.

                               KUMAR
                 So what? We'll take everything he wrote
                 down about you and leave.
                        (beat)
                 Unless you want to stay here all night
                 and not be able to hand your work in
                 tomorrow.
          Harold thinks about this for a second.

                                HAROLD
                 Fine.    Hurry up.
          Kumar smiles.   He begins searching for a key.

               Kumar finds A BIG METAL KEY RING on Palumbo's desk...

                                   KUMAR
                      Yes! I was hoping it would be one of
                      these big ring of keys. Now I get to try
                      all of them to see which one will...

                                   HAROLD
                      Kumar, hurry the fuck up!
               Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple
               keys, when he suddenly smells something...

                                   KUMAR
                      What's that smell?
               Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on
               Officer Reilly's desk.

                                   HAROLD
                      Kumar?...Kumar!
               Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a
               romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the BAG OF WEED...

               It's a beautiful, sunny day in the park, as KUMAR pushes THE
               BAG OF WEED on a swing, like young lovers do in movies...

               KUMAR has his arms around THE BAG OF WEED as he helps it
               swing the golf club. It's a hole in one! KUMAR TURNS THE

               BAG OF WEED AROUND AND GIVES IT A KISS.

               CARICATURE SKETCH ARTIST. The Artist reveals his sketch to
               Kumar and The Bag of Weed. It obviously looks ridiculous.

                 THE BAG OF WEED is holding a box containing pictures and
                 memorabilia of it's relationship to the HIPPIE ASSHOLE. The
                 Bag of Weed throws the box in a GARBAGE CAN.
                 Kumar lights a match and throws it in the can, setting it
                 aflame. He and the bag of weed face each other and kiss...

                 BAG OF WEED starts to go under the covers. We watch, as the
                 sheets move up and down. KUMAR STARTS TO HAVE AN ORGASM...
                 THE BAG OF WEED comes up from under the covers. Kumar gives
                 it a kiss. THEN, HE GOES UNDER THE COVERS. We see THE BAG

                 OF WEED START TO TREMBLE AND SHUDDER IN ECSTASY...

                 KUMAR (wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is
                 frustrated as he looks at his BILLS. THE BAG OF WEED (wearing
                 a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a MUG OF

                 COFFEE. IT GIVES KUMAR THE COFFEE. KUMAR TAKES A SIP. IT'S

                 TOO COLD. HE SPITS IT OUT AND SLAPS THE BAG OF WEED...

                 DEPRESSED, THE BAG OF WEED WALKS AWAY FROM THE TABLE...
                 KUMAR hears THE BAG OF WEED crying from the other room.   He
                 obviously feels guilty...

                 KUMAR GETS UP AND RUNS OVER TO THE BAG OF WEED. HE PICKS IT

                 UP, GIVES IT A KISS, AND EMBRACES IT WITH ALL OF HIS SOUL...

                Kumar walks away from the cell, goes over to the desk, picks
                up the bag of weed and caresses it...

                                    HAROLD
                       What the hell are you...
                Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room,
                pushing a black man wearing pajamas (NATHANIEL BANKS).
                Nathaniel seems very gentle. He's even wearing a turtleneck
                sweater.

                                    OFFICER PALUMBO
                              (to Nathaniel)
                       You thought you could get away with this,
                       huh?

                                    NATHANIEL
                       Where am I? I was in bed.         I didn't fire
                       any gun, I swear...
                Suddenly, Officer Reilly looks over to the jail cell...

                                 (pointing)
                       Look!
                All the cops turn to the cell. Kumar is still holding the
                weed. He doesn't know what to do. Harold is scared shitless.

                                   OFFICER PALUMBO
                             (re: Tarik)
                       Shit! Jackson's trying to escape!
                Tarik looks up from his book...

                       What?     Oh, not again!
                The cops handcuff Nathaniel to the leg of a desk, and run
                over to the jail cell, ignoring Kumar and the weed.

                                    OFFICER PALUMBO
                       Stop trying to escape!

                       I'm sitting down!
                They turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm
                into the room. Harold stands back, confused. Tarik leans
                against the wall, ready to be handcuffed. The cops grab him
                and throw him down against the bed.

                In the midst of all the action, Kumar grabs Harold and pulls
                him out of the cell. HAROLD GOES OVER TO PALUMBO'S DESK AND
                PICKS UP HIS WALLET AND LAPTOP, along with the police report.
                They start running out of the room. Kumar's still clinging
                to the weed.

                HAROLD and KUMAR (still clinging to the weed) burst out the
                door and run down the steps. They race through the street
                and start heading towards a FOREST.

                                      KUMAR

                HAROLD and KUMAR have stopped running.   They start catching
                their breath.

                                    HAROLD
                       Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking

                Suddenly, they hear what sounds like A COYOTE'S HOWL.

                                    HAROLD
                       What was that?

                                    KUMAR
                       Just a coyote. Don't worry.

                 That's only because they sound scary. In

                 take a coyote down.

          The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.

                              HAROLD
                 We're gonna die.

                              KUMAR
                 Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to
                 eating zebras and shit. They're not
                 known for eating humans.

          WITH THAT, THE CHEETAH WALKS OVER TO A NEARBY BUSH AND DRAGS

          OUT A HALF-EATEN HUMAN CORPSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN DEVOURING.

                 Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign.
                 But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll
                 probably leave us alone.
          HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins
          walking directly over to HAROLD...

                              HAROLD
                        (whispering)
                 This isn't working.

                               KUMAR
                 Shhh.
          Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON

          WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAROLD'S GROIN AREA.

                              HAROLD
                        (eyes closed, screaming)

                 HE'S MAULING ME! HE'S MAULING ME!
          HAROLD continues screaming for the next TEN SECONDS.
          Eventually, he calms down and looks at the CHEETAH.

                THE CHEETAH IS NOT EATING HAROLD.    HE'S EATING THE BEEF JERKY

                THAT HAROLD HAD IN HIS PANTS.

                                    KUMAR
                              (annoyed)
                       I thought I told you not to take that
                       jerky!
                HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't
                been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins
                licking Harold's face in friendship.

                                      HAROLD
                       He likes me.
                Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up...

                                    KUMAR
                       Dude, I think I have an idea.

                                      HAROLD
                       What is it?

                                    KUMAR
                       I'll tell you, but first we have to get
                       really high.
                Kumar opens the bag of weed.
                Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse.   We see smoke
                coming up from below. Pan back down...

                Harold and Kumar are now sitting on top of the CHEETAH,
                smoking joints. Kumar has a belt around the cheetah's neck
                like reigns on a horse.

                                    HAROLD
                       Has it come to this?    Are we really gonna
                       ride this cheetah?

                                    KUMAR
                       Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on
                       the planet. It's as good as a car.
                Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away.

                                    HAROLD
                       This is either a really smart move, or by
                       far the stupidest thing we've ever done.
                HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on.    Kumar puts the
                bag of weed under his shirt...

                              (like to a snow dog)
                       Mush! Mush!

                SUDDENLY, THE CHEETAH DARTS OUT LIKE LIGHTENING WITH HAROLD

                AND KUMAR ON IT'S BACK. EVEN THOUGH IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO

                SENSE, WE SEE THE CHEETAH ZOOMING PAST STREETS AND FORESTS.

                HAROLD AND KUMAR ARE BOUNCING UP AND DOWN AS IT RACES ACROSS

                A MAJOR HIGHWAY...

                                    HAROLD
                       Dude, am I just really high or is this is
                       actually working?!

                                     KUMAR
                       Both!

                                    HAROLD
                       This is great! We'll be at White Castle
                       in no...

                SMACK! A BRANCH HITS HAROLD IN THE FACE, KNOCKING HIM OFF THE
                CHEETAH. Harold lands on the ground-- his head bleeding.
                His eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious...

                THE LAND OF BURGERS is an OZ-like world-- the entire terrain,
                with all it's rolling hills, IS MADE UP OF HAMBURGERS. Music
                plays as HAROLD and MARIA skip through THE LAND OF BURGERS,
                holding hands.
                Along the way, they run by...
                The BLACK GUYS from the BASKETBALL GAME, all waltzing with
                each other, in white tuxedos. HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK GUY
                gives Harold the same scary look from before....
                FREAK SHOW is shoveling some burgers from the ground into a
                wheelbarrow. He waves to Harold and Maria. He then takes out
                a CHAINSAW and starts cutting off the arm he's waving with.
                KUMAR and the MALE NURSE, who are playing Twister, while
                getting high. After a spin of the wheel, Kumar reluctantly         
                gets in a position where it looks like he's taking the Male
                Nurse from behind. Kumar's not happy.
                Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill,
                UNTIL HAROLD IS ON TOP OF MARIA. Harold picks up a burger
                from the ground. Maria does the same. They proceed to feed
                each other their burgers. They munch on them, looking into
                each other's eyes...

                                    MARIA
                       I love you, Harold.

                                    HAROLD
                       I love you, Maria.
                MARIA gets up and runs away. HAROLD playfully chases her.
                Maria runs over to a FRENCH FRY TREE. SHE PLUCKS A COUPLE

                FRENCH FRIES FROM THE BRANCH AND FEEDS THEM TO HAROLD.             

                                    COLE (O.S.)
                       Wow, you guys are really extreme...
                HAROLD turns and sees COLE KAYAKING DOWN A NEARBY STREAM...

                                    COLE
                       ...extremely gay that is.

                SUDDENLY, AN ARROW GOES RIGHT THROUGH COLE'S NECK! BLOOD

                STARTS GUSHING OUT. HE FALLS OFF THE KAYAK, INTO THE WATER.
                HAROLD is shocked. He turns around and sees MARIA, HOLDING A
                CROSSBOW. She smiles at him. HE THEN JUMPS ON TOP OF HER

                AND THEY BEGIN MAKING LOVE ON TOP OF THE BURGERS...

                                    MARIA
                       Oh Harold! Yes! Yes! Oh, God-- you
                       have the biggest dick of all time! It's
                       so long! And wide, for that matter!
                Suddenly, Harold turns and sees the BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                lying down near them. He is staring at them, with no
                expression on his face, with his hand down his pants--
                rubbing his penis furiously. Harold is disturbed.

                                    MARIA
                       Don't worry about him...
                MARIA rolls over so SHE'S ON TOP OF HAROLD. SHE STARTS

                LICKING HIS FACE, LIKE A DOG. WHEN SHE DOESN'T STOP LICKING,

                HAROLD STARTS GETTING A LITTLE CONFUSED...

                AWAY FROM HIM...

                              HAROLD
                 What the hell are you doing?!!!

                              KUMAR
                 I'm sorry! You've been out cold for the
                 past half-hour! I figured that maybe if
                 I did some gay shit you'd wake up.
          HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he
          sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves.

                              HAROLD
                 What happened to the cheetah?

                              KUMAR
                 It ran away. But forget about that. I
                 have some bad news and some worse news.

                              HAROLD
                        (nervous)
                 Tell me the worse news first.

                              KUMAR
                 I checked out some road signs. The
                 cheetah took us in the wrong direction.

                                HAROLD
                 That sucks.    What's the bad news?

                              KUMAR
                 Your laptop is completely destroyed.
          Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag,
          broken in pieces.

                                HAROLD

                 WHAT????????

                              KUMAR
                 It smashed against a tree when you fell
                 off the cheetah.

                              HAROLD
                 Why the hell didn't you say that THAT was
                 the "worse news"?

                              KUMAR
                 Well, the laptop really only effects you.
                 Whereas the White Castle situation
                 effects both of us equally.

                They stand there, watching silently as NEIL drives off.
                Harold is now drenched. Muddy water drips from his hair and
                clothing. He gives Kumar a dirty look. Kumar knows he
                shouldn't push Harold any further.

                        Fucking asshole.
                 Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something
                 through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and
                 points...

                                        HAROLD
                        Look!
                 Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside,
                 sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five
                 cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down...
                 Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY
                 FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first
                 bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT.
                 HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly...

                              HAROLD
                        (yearning)
                 I want that.

                                KUMAR
                 What?    A chocolate cream filled?

                               HAROLD
                 No.  I want that feeling.
                        (beat)
                 The feeling that comes over a man when he
                 finally gets exactly what he desires.
                        (beat)
                 I NEED that feeling.

                              KUMAR
                 Are you saying what I think you're
                 saying?

                              HAROLD
                 We gotta go to White Castle.
          KUMAR gives HAROLD a hug.

                                KUMAR
                 Yes!    I knew you had it in you!
          Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else
          is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table...

                              KUMAR
                 Is that Cindy Kim?
          Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein.
          Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of
          donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are "an item."

                              KUMAR
                 You should have boned her when you had
                 the chance.
          Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head
          by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold.

                              HAROLD
                        (to Cole)
                 Hey, why don't you just leave us alone?

                             COLE
                 Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it,
                 Mr. Miagi?
          Cole gets in the CRANE POSITION a la THE KARATE KID...
          Harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at Cole's little
          racist routine. He then lets out a little laugh...

                                    HAROLD
                       Nothing.
                Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee
                Kreme entrance. Kumar follows. In the background Cole and the
                Punks are laughing about what a "pussy" Harold is.

                                    KUMAR
                              (pissed off, but
                               powerless)
                       Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit!

                                    HAROLD
                              (totally calm)
                       Don't worry. The universe tends to
                       unfold as it should.
                Kumar gives a "What the fuck is he talking about?" look.

                                    HAROLD
                       Besides, I have a plan.   Follow my
                       lead...

                                    KUMAR
                       Your lead?
                Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads
                towards the YELLOW JEEP at a brisk pace. KUMAR follows.

                SUDDENLY, HAROLD SNATCHES COLE'S KEYS FROM THE HOOD OF THE

                JEEP AND RUSHES INSIDE THE DRIVER'S SIDE.
                One of the Extreme Sports Punks sees Harold doing this...

                                     EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                       Hey, Cole!   Look!
                Cole turns to see Harold in his car. Kumar is about to get
                in the passenger's side. Cole and the Punks start running
                towards the car! Kumar sees this and quickly gets inside.
                HAROLD puts the car in reverse, nearly hitting the punks.

          114   INT. COLE'S YELLOW JEEP                                     114
                Harold is shifting gears...

                                    KUMAR
                       What the hell are you doing?!

                                    HAROLD
                       I'm stealing their car.

                                    KUMAR
                       This is your plan?

                                    HAROLD
                       It's working isn't it?

                Harold drives the car out of the parking lot.   Cole and the
                Punks give chase on their skateboards.

                                    KUMAR
                              (laughing)
                       Hey, slow down to like 25 mph, so they
                       think they have a chance to catch up.

          115   EXT. ROAD                                                   115
                Harold drives COLE'S JEEP down at a speed just slow enough
                for COLE and the PUNKS to think that they have a chance...

          116   INT. COLE'S YELLOW JEEP                                     116
                Kumar then sticks his head out the window...

                                    KUMAR
                              (in thick Indian Accent)
                       Thank you, come again!
                Harold guns it-- leaving Cole and the Punks in the dust.

                We see Cole and the Punks watching in disbelief as Harold and
                Kumar drive off with their car.

                                    EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                       Dude, that was so NOT extreme!

                                    COLE
                       I know Extreme Sports Punk #1, I know.
                The Extreme Sports Punks walk away, leaving Cole by himself.

                HAROLD and KUMAR are laughing and slapping five.

                                    KUMAR
                       Victory is sweet! Nice job, Roldy!

                                    HAROLD
                       I had to do something.
                KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air...

                                     KUMAR
                       Wait.   Do you smell that?
                KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He
                reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. It's
                a WHITE CASTLE bag. He pours out the contents and we see
                EMPTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER CARTONS fall onto Kumar's lap.

                                    KUMAR
                       Those assholes got to have White Castle?!

                                    HAROLD
                       This world is so unfair.

                                    KUMAR
                       Don't worry . Forget about that. We
                       have a car now. We're back in the game.
                       Pretty soon we'll be eating our own White
                       Castle. Want me to drive?

                                    HAROLD
                       No. I've got everything under control. We
                       should be able to get there with enough
                       time for me to get my work done after our
                       feast. Just find us some tunes.
                A tape is resting in the tape deck.   KUMAR pushes it in...
                HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other amazed that COLE has some
                lame chick song on his tape.

                                    KUMAR
                       Those guys are fucking posers!

                We see COLE'S YELLOW JEEP speeding along the highway. We see
                signs indicating they're getting closer to Cherry Hill...

                Harold and Kumar are now listening to another lame chick
                song. While they aren't fully embracing the song, it's clear
                they're kind of enjoying it.

                lame chick song.

                They're speeding down a road lined by forests on both sides.
                We see the Jeep speeds by a COP CAR...

                OFFICER BRUCKS (middle-aged, tough, toothpick in his mouth)
                sees the yellow jeep speed by. He reloads his rifle...

                HAROLD and KUMAR are still singing...
                All of a sudden, HAROLD and KUMAR hear a POLICE SIREN.

                                      KUMAR
                       Oh shit!
                KUMAR turns around and sees the police car behind them.

                       I found them. And I'm gonna need back-up.

                Kumar buckles his seat belt.   HAROLD MAKES A SHARP TURN...

                The YELLOW JEEP goes around a turn in the road and then CUTS

                INTO THE FOREST, DISAPPEARING IN THE WOODS...
                We then see the COP CAR go around the turn. It passes by the
                point where HAROLD and KUMAR entered the forest.

                From OFFICER BRUCKS'S POV, we see that he has a long stretch
                ahead, with no cars in sight.

                                    OFFICER BRUCKS
                       What the hell?
                He puts his foot on the brakes, bringing the car to a
                screeching halt.
                OFFICER BRUCKS gets out of the car and looks around wondering
                where the YELLOW JEEP went. HE THEN HEARS THE SOUND OF

                BRANCHES CRACKING IN THE WOODS...

                Harold is holding onto the wheel for dear life. Kumar is
                scared as shit. They're both bouncing up and down.

                                    KUMAR
                       Where the hell are we going?!

                                    HAROLD
                       Just hold on!

                Harold and Kumar are still bouncing up and down...

                                    KUMAR
                       It's a good thing I have an empty
                       stomach, or else I'd puke right now!

                                     HAROLD
                        Don't worry. We're gonna make it.
                        Everything's gonna be...

                THEY NOTICE THEY'RE ABOUT TO DRIVE OVER THE EDGE OF A CLIFF.

                            HAROLD                             KUMAR
                Shit!                               Fuck!

                HAROLD HITS THE BRAKES AS HARD AS HE CAN...

          138   EXT. CLIFF - 6:40 AM                                        138
                We see the jeep stop just short of the cliff. Harold and
                Kumar get out of the jeep and walk over to the edge of the
                cliff and look down. IT'S A VERY STEEP DROP.

                SUDDENLY, KUMAR SEES SOMETHING OUT IN THE DISTANCE...

                                    KUMAR
                              (pointing)
                        Rold! Look out there!

                HAROLD LOOKS TO WHERE KUMAR IS POINTING-- IT'S A WHITE CASTLE

                WAY DOWN BELOW, ABOUT A MILE AWAY.

                THEY THEN HEAR A POLICE SIREN COMING FROM BACK IN THE WOODS.

                                      HAROLD
                        Oh shit!   We're trapped!
                Kumar notices something...

                                     KUMAR
                        Not necessarily.
                KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER...

                                     HAROLD
                        No. No way. Not a chance.       I'd rather
                        turn myself in than die.

                                     KUMAR
                        Dude, it's okay. I used to hang-glide
                        with my dad all the time when I was kid.
                        I know how to do it.

                                     HAROLD
                        You hang-glided? I don't remember that.

                                     KUMAR
                        We did it on our trips   to India. I
                        swear. I know exactly    what I'm doing.
                        I've even done it with   two people at the
                        same time. My brother    and I did it.

                              KUMAR (cont'd)
                 Just hold onto the outside bars and let
                 me take care of the rest.

                              HAROLD
                 No, Kumar. I'm not risking my life over
                 a bunch of hamburgers.
          KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye...

                              KUMAR
                 You think this just about the burgers,
                 huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about
                 far more than that.
          KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto
          the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The
          scene is very picturesque...

                              KUMAR
                 Our parents came to this country,
                 escaping persecution, poverty, and
                 hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very,
                 very hungry. And they wanted to live in
                 a land that treated them as equals. A
                 land where their kids could study and get
                 into good colleges. A land filled with
                 hamburger stands. And not just one type
                 of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with
                 different sizes, toppings, and
                 condiments. That land was America.

          THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER...

                              KUMAR
                        (turning to Rold)
                 You think this is just about the burgers?
                 No. This is about achieving what our
                 parents set out for. This is about the
                 pursuit of happiness. This is about the
                 American dream.
          KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.

                               KUMAR
                 And so we've reached this point. The
                 point which all men eventually have to
                 face. The point of no return.
                        (beat)
                 We can stay here, get arrested and end
                 our hopes of ever going to White Castle.
                 Or we can take the hang-glider and make
                 our leap towards freedom. I leave the
                 decision up to you.
          From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are
          getting closer. Harold turns back, facing Kumar...

                                    HAROLD

                HAROLD AND KUMAR ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE CLIFF,

                HOLDING THE HANG-GLIDER. THE SIRENS ARE GETTING LOUDER...

                                    HAROLD
                       Hurry up...they're almost here!

                                    KUMAR
                       Grab onto the end of the bars and hold on
                       tight.
                HAROLD does as he's told. They are both holding onto the
                bars (Harold behind Kumar).

                                    KUMAR
                       Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. On
                       the count of three, we're gonna run to
                       the edge of the cliff. When I say
                       "jump," launch yourself forward as if you
                       were diving into a pool, got it?

                                    HAROLD
                              (nervous)
                       I think so.

                                    KUMAR
                       Don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine.
                       Are you ready?
                HAROLD's too nervous to speak.   KUMAR gets into position.

                                    KUMAR
                       Okay, here goes. One...two...three!
                HAROLD and KUMAR START RUNNING TOWARDS THE CLIFF.

                                    KUMAR
                       Good job, Rold! Keep running!

                THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER...

                                    KUMAR
                       Rold, there's something I gotta tell you.
                       I've never hang-glided before.

                                    HAROLD

                       WHAT???

                                    KUMAR

                       JUMP!!!

                HAROLD AND KUMAR JUMP OFF, JUST AS THE COP CAR ARRIVES.

                 The hang glider coasts through the air for a couple seconds.

                 THEN, SUDDENLY, THE GUYS START GOING DOWN AT A SHARP ANGLE!

                             HAROLD                            KUMAR

                 AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!                   AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

                 JUST THEN, THE HANG GLIDER CATCHES ONTO THE WIND AND STARTS

                 GLIDING THROUGH THE SKY.

                                       HAROLD

                        jump off a cliff?

                 OFFICER BRUCKS gets out of the car, holding his rifle and
                 runs over to the jeep. He looks inside...

                                     OFFICER BRUCKS
                               (to the walkie-talkie)
                        It appears they've escaped. They ditched
                        their jeep.
                 OFFICER BRUCKS opens the front door of the car and peers
                 inside. He notices THE BAG OF WEED ON THE DASHBOARD. He
                 opens it and TASTES SOME WEED in the same way a drug cop
                 would taste cocaine during a bust.

                                     OFFICER BRUCKS
                               (to the walkie-talkie)
                        Good news. I found enough dope in the
                        car to send those skateboard punks to
                        jail for the next couple years. Looks
                        like they've terrorized their last
                        convenience store.
                 Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth
                 is strangely appealing. He thinks for a beat as he eyes the
                 bag of weed. He then takes another taste of it. He looks
                 again at the bag. Like Kumar, we can tell that he's in
                 love...

                 Our triumphant heros are gliding across the morning sky.
                 Harold and Kumar look down as they soar above the trees...

                                     HAROLD
                        Dude, we're so high right now.

                                     KUMAR
                        We're not low.
                 They continue gliding though the sky for a while...

                                       HAROLD
                        Hey, Kumar?

                        Yeah?

                        How are we gonna get down?

                                     KUMAR
                        Uh...well...I guess it's just gonna go
                        down at some point.

                                     HAROLD
                        That's a great answer. Made me feel
                        really comfortable. Thanks a lot.
                 KUMAR looks down as they fly over a playground.

                                     HAROLD
                        Is it a problem if we fly into birds?

                                     KUMAR

                 Because we're about to!
          KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYING

          STRAIGHT TOWARDS THEM.

                               KUMAR
                 Oh shit!
          HAROLD AND KUMAR FLY RIGHT INTO THE CROWS.   Numerous birds
          collide with their faces...

                 Ahhhh!   My eyes! Don't peck out my eyes!

          THE BIRDS CAUSE THE HANG-GLIDER TO GO AGAINST THE WIND,

          SENDING HAROLD AND KUMAR DOWN FAST. THEY ARE SCREAMING AND

          YELLING AS THEY PLUMMET...

                              KUMAR
                 We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

                               HAROLD
                 I hate you!   I hate you so much!

          THE HANG-GLIDER FALLS STRAIGHT INTO A TREE AND GETS CAUGHT IN

          THE BRANCHES. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SAVED.

                               KUMAR
                 We're gonna live! Ha! Ha! We're gonna
                 live!
                        (beat)
                 You see, Rold? That wasn't so bad.

          SNAP!!! THE BRANCH BREAKS OFF, SENDING HAROLD AND KUMAR

          STRAIGHT DOWN. THEY FALL ABOUT THIRTY FEET, THUMPING ON

          BRANCHES AS THEY FALL...

          SMACK!!! THEY HIT THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY START ROLLING

          DOWN A HILL. THEY CONTINUE ROLLING...ROLLING...ROLLING...

          FINALLY-- THEY STOP ROLLING WHEN THEY HIT HARD PAVEMENT.
          HAROLD gets up before he can catch his breath...

                              HAROLD
                        (breathing heavily)
                 That's it...I'm gonna kill you...

          HAROLD GRABS KUMAR BY THE NECK AND STARTS CHOKING HIM!

                              KUMAR
                 Stop...I...can't...breathe...

                              HAROLD

                       Rold...look!

                HAROLD TURNS AROUND. HE RELEASES KUMAR FROM HIS GRIP. KUMAR

                STARTS CATCHING HIS BREATH. HAROLD STANDS UP. SOON AFTER,

                KUMAR STANDS UP. KUMAR THEN PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HAROLD...

                                    KUMAR
                       We made it, dude.

                FROM HAROLD AND KUMAR'S POV, WE SEE THE WHITE CASTLE IN FRONT

                OF THEM. THEY ARE STANDING IN THE PARKING LOT. HAROLD AND

                KUMAR SLOWLY WALK OVER TO THE ENTRANCE.

                THEY BOTH LOOK AT EACH OTHER-- THEY'RE TOO HAPPY TO SMILE,

                BUT THEIR EYES SAY IT ALL. THEY ENTER THE RESTAURANT...

          142   INT. WHITE CASTLE - 7:00 AM                                  142
                Harold and Kumar walk inside. Their shirts are torn and
                tattered, their bodies are scratched up, and they're covered
                in dirt. Everyone in the restaurant turns and stares at them.
                They approach the counter, where A TEENAGER STANDING...

                                    TEENAGER
                       Looks like you guys had some night, huh?
                Harold and Kumar look at each other, and then back at the
                teenager. Their expressions are stone cold...

                                    HAROLD
                       I want thirty slyders. I want five french
                       fries. I want four large Cherry cokes.

                                      KUMAR
                       Same.    Only make mine Diet Cokes.

                                    TEENAGER
                       Wow. That comes to...forty-two dollars
                       and seventy-five cents.
                HAROLD and KUMAR take out their WALLETS.     THEY OPEN THEM UP.

                THE WALLETS ARE EMPTY!

                                    HAROLD
                       Hey...hey...hey...where's my money?!

                              KUMAR
                 You don't have money?! Shit, I gave all
                 mine to that asshole at Princeton! Fuck
                 that hippie fuck! This can't be
                 happening! We're so close and we're
                 fucking broke!

                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                 Let me take care of it.
          HAROLD and KUMAR turn around and see NEIL PATRICK HARRIS
          finishing his coke. He throws it in the trash. HAROLD and
          KUMAR are stunned.

                              KUMAR
                 What are you doing here?

                              NEIL
                 You guys kept talking about White Castle
                 last night. It made me start craving it
                 too.

                              HAROLD
                 Where's my fucking car you prick!

                              NEIL
                 Yeah. Sorry about that. Like I said, I
                 was tripping balls last night. I don't
                 know what came over me. Your car's out
                 in the parking lot. Here are the keys.
          NEIL tosses HAROLD the car keys.

                              KUMAR
                 Do you realize what we had to go through
                 after you stole the car?

                              NEIL
                 I know. It was a dick move on my part.
                 That's why I'm paying for your meal.
          Harold and Kumar look at each other, relieved.

                              HAROLD
                 Thanks, I guess.
          NEIL hands them some cash...

                              NEIL
                 Here's fifty for the meal, and two
                 hundred for the car.

                              HAROLD
                        (concerned)
                 What happened to the car?

                              NEIL
                 I made some love stains in the back seat.
                 You'll see. Anyway, take it easy guys.
                 I'll see you around.

                              HAROLD
                 Where are you going?

                              NEIL
                 Wherever God takes me.
          With that, NEIL walks out of the restaurant.   HAROLD and
          KUMAR look at each other, confused.

                              TEENAGER
                 Hey guys...it's gonna take a little while
                 to make all those burgers. You might as
                 well sit down.
          HAROLD and KUMAR walk over to a booth and take a seat.

                              KUMAR
                 Dude, we're here. Isn't it great?

                              HAROLD
                 I know. I can't believe we made it. AND
                 we got the car back! If we can just get
                 out of here in a half hour, I can get
                 back to my office and get the work done.

                               KUMAR
                 Hey, look!
          KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant.    On the
          screen we see A MORNING NEWS SHOW.

                 What happened last night was a complete

                 less than justice...

                 those black bastards think they're gonna
                 get away with this, they've got another
                 thing coming! Me and my white buddies
                 are gonna [bleep] them up!

                HAROLD and KUMAR have finished their meals. They both look
                full and satisfied. Harold takes one last sip of his soda.

                                    HAROLD
                       Oh...that hit the spot.

                       It was the best meal of my life.

                       afraid being just another nerdy Indian

                HAROLD pretends to be listening to KUMAR-- BUT HE IS MORE
                FOCUSED ON BILLY AND J.D., who get out of the car with their
                women and start walking towards the front door.

                                    KUMAR
                       Like having boils all over your face. Or
                       dealing with the shit those black guys
                       had to go through.

                                    HAROLD
                              (not paying attention)
                       Uh-huh.

                              KUMAR
                 Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty
                 cool saving that guy's life last night.
                 Somewhere between that, getting yelled at
                 by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick
                 Harris, I realized that I've always
                 wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been
                 too scared to admit it.
          KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...

                              KUMAR
                 Hey, Rold, are you listening to me?   I'm
                 having a major epiphany here.

                              HAROLD
                 I'll be right back...
          At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with
          their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like
          some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On
          the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about
          her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple...

                              J.D.
                 Hey, Billy-- you paying for this or what?

                              BILLY
                 I'll be there in a second...
          J.D. and TRACY check out the menu. BILLY takes ZOE aside--
          whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you
          complete me" moment...

                              BILLY
                 Look, I have to admit something to you.
                 At the start of last night, all I really
                 cared about was getting some. But then I
                 met you, Zoe. You're so different from
                 all the other women I've ever met.
                 You're smart, funny, artistic. I guess
                 what I'm trying to say is...

                              HAROLD (O.S.)
                 What the fuck is going on here?
          BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD...

                               BILLY
                 Harold?   What are you...?

                              HAROLD
                 Never mind me. What are you doing here?
                 I thought you and J.D. were busy all
                 night with "clients." Isn't that why I
                 had to do YOUR work?

          J.D. hears the commotion and turns around...

                              J.D.
                 Hey! What the hell is going on here?

                              HAROLD
                 Back off, cock boy! What I have to say
                 to him goes double for you!
          KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.

                              J.D.
                 Cock boy? I'm sorry, but did you just
                 call me "cock boy?"

                              HAROLD
                 Yeah, you know I did. You're just
                 stalling because you're not quick enough
                 to think of a comeback.

                               J.D.
                 Oh, I'm not quick enough?
                        (to Billy)
                 He thinks I'm not quick enough.
                        (to Harold)
                 Well, I got news for you...
                        (long beat, thinking)
                 I am quick enough...
                        (beat)
                 ...cock boy!
          J.D. is embarrassed. BILLY tries to placate the situation.

                              BILLY
                 Listen Harry...

                              J.D.
                        (to Billy)
                 Don't even bother with him.   We'll just
                 tell Berenson later...

                              HAROLD
                 Tell him what? That I'm your work horse!
                 That you guys think you can just party
                 all weekend and leave all your work to
                 the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh?
          J.D. is stunned.   Now he's a little nervous.

                              J.D.
                 No, no-- you don't understand...

                              HAROLD
                 No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing
                 your work anymore.

                       And if either one of you douchebags ever
                       tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to
                       Berenson and tell him what's really going
                       on.
                Harold notices Traci and Zoe listening...

                                    HAROLD
                       And I'll tell everyone in the office how
                       you both caught gonorrhea from that
                       whore.
                TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out.   They slowly
                back away from BILLY and J.D....

                                    HAROLD
                       Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get
                       going. See you on Monday.
                HAROLD leaves the RESTAURANT. KUMAR follows.     Billy and J.D.
                are left embarrassed and in shock.

                HAROLD and KUMAR walk over to Harold's Infiniti...

                                    KUMAR
                       Way to go, Rold! Where the hell did that
                       come from?

                                    HAROLD
                       I don't know. Eating those delicious
                       burgers made me feel like a new man. Now
                       I'm actually looking forward to work this
                       week.

                                    KUMAR
                       No shit! I guess you're worthwhile after
                       all.

                                    HAROLD
                       I'm not worthless.

                                    KUMAR
                       So those dudes have gonorrhea?

                                     HAROLD
                       Beats me.

                       Now, come on, let's get going.

                                    KUMAR
                       What's the rush? There's plenty of time
                       before my interview.

                                    HAROLD
                       I have some unfinished business to take
                       care of.
                They both get into the car (Harold gets in the driver's
                side). The car zooms out...

                The elevator doors open. Harold and Kumar exit. Kumar gives
                Harold a pat on the back...

                                    KUMAR
                       Good luck, dude.
                KUMAR stands behind, while HAROLD approaches MARIA'S door.

                HAROLD TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND THEN KNOCKS ON THE DOOR...

                THERE IS TENSION AS HAROLD WAITS. THEN, FINALLY, THE DOOR

                KNOB BEGINS TO TURN AND THE DOOR OPENS--

                A GOOD-LOOKING, MUSCULAR HISPANIC MAN (LUIS) IS STANDING

                BEHIND THE DOOR WEARING ONLY HIS BOXERS. HE HAS LIPSTICK ALL

                OVER HIS NECK AND CHEST...

                                    LUIS
                       What do you want?

                A LOOK OF EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT GOES OVER HAROLD'S FACE.

                 She seemed so sweet at first, but it
                 turns out she's into some pretty freaky
                 shit. She even did this thing where she
                 took a lollipop and shoved it...

                              HAROLD
                        (grossed out/depressed)

                 interrupting you guys...
          Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING
          MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend.
          Just then, Luis leans his head out the door...

                              LUIS
                 Hey-- if you're looking for Maria, she
                 left for Europe this morning.
          Harold quickly turns around and runs back over.

                               HAROLD
                 Huh?

                              LUIS
                 She's going to Amsterdam for ten days.
                 I'm Luis -- Maria's brother.
          Luis shakes Harold's hand.    Harold suddenly feels better.

                                HAROLD
                 Oh!    Maria's brother!

                              LUIS
                 You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps
                 talking about.

                              HAROLD
                 Actually, I'm Kor...wait a second-- she
                 talks about me?
          A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string,
          walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him...

                              AISHA
                 Are you coming or what?

                              LUIS
                 Hey, I'll be there in a second, baby. Do
                 me a favor-- make me that omelette you
                 were talking about. You know, with the
                 sun-dried tomatoes.
          Aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. Luis gives
          her a little a slap on the ass. Harold doesn't quite know
          how to respond to this.

                 Uh, no thanks. I'd rather do it in
                 person.

                 Then take it easy, hermano.
          Luis shuts the door.    Kumar runs over to Harold...

                 Dude...we gotta go!

                 To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now
                 and take the next plane.

                              HAROLD
                 What are you talking about? Are you out
                 of your mind? What about your interview
                 with the med school guy?

                              KUMAR
                 Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule
                 it. He won't have a problem, as long as
                 I'm taking it seriously for a change.
                 Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!

                              HAROLD
                 She's coming back in ten days! It's not
                 like I'm never gonna see her again.

                              KUMAR
                 For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is
                 the kiss of death. There are gonna be
                 suave, sophisticated guys all over her.
                 By the time she gets back, she may not be

          Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying.

                               HAROLD
                 Forget it.   I'll just wait till she comes
                 back.
          Harold starts to walk away from Kumar...

                               KUMAR
                 Hey, Rold!   Wait!

                Harold stops.

                                    KUMAR
                       You do realize what's legal in Amsterdam,
                       right?

                HAROLD TURNS AROUND. KUMAR HAS A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE.

                SLOWLY, BUT SURELY, HAROLD STARTS TO SMILE AS WELL.

                THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.    "TO BE CONTINUED..."

                                                             FADE OUT.

								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT 
                 Ah, what he does not know will not
                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE 
                 Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You gotta use the microphone.


 ZEKE 
                 Oh yeah.
                 (shouts into microphone)
                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary
                 Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify
                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.
                 Here we go.


ZEKE jams the gearshift into hyper-drive.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed
of light.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - LATER 
ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spacecraft looks like an apple
heading toward a freight train as it approaches the
enormous mother-ship.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL CONSOLE 
An ashtray full of roaches sits on the console.  ZEKE is
at the controls with a joint in his mouth.  He is swaying
back and forth, eyes glazed.  Beside him, EDSEL watches
the mothership getting closer.


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You okay to land this thing?


 ZEKE 
                 No problem, man.


 CUT TO 

MOTHERSHIP'S LANDING AREA 
Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide
landing area as the round spaceship glides in.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 I think you're goin' a little high,
                 man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 It's okay, man.  If there's one
                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you
                 know your perspective's fucked,
                 so you just gotta let your hands
                 work the controls as if you're
                 straight.


The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow, good landing, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Thanks.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - ENTRANCE HATCH 
ZEKE and EDSEL press a button to open the hatch doors.
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards
waiting on the other side.  Between them stands a small,
shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and
cauliflower ears.  This is HANOVER FISTE.


 REGOLIAN GUARD                     (to Zeke and Edsel)

                 This man is to be delivered to the,
                 clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom
                 #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln Sternn.
                 Thenk yew.  Clik.


The guards wheel away.


 FISTE                     (meekly)

                 Ah, hello.


 CUT TO 

CORRIDOR IN SPACESHIP 
ZEKE and EDSEL escort FISTE down the corridor.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Umm, you're gonna testify at
                 Sternn's trial?


FISTE nods.


 ZEKE 
                 They gotta give him at least, like,
                 life.


 FISTE 
                 Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable
                 man.
                 (camera pulls close to Fiste's face)
                 He will be freed.


 CUT TO 

SPACE - LATER 
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through
a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past
a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Y'know, I wish they'd clean this place
                 up, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.  It's like pig city out here.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.


 CUT TO 

ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy-
paks.


 ROBOT 
                 ... but I don't understand.  We
                 laugh together.  We care for each
                 other.  We have highly proficient
                 sex.  Why can't we get married?


 GLORIA 
                 Look, we're different, okay?  Let's
                 leave it at that.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL ROOM 
The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through,
still talking.


 GLORIA 
                 ... but mixed marriages just don't
                 work.  What if you get tired of me
                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside
them.


 ZEKE 
                 There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang
                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP 
An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse
floats into view, completely filling the screen.  ZEKE and
EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame,
approaching the mammoth structure.


 CUT TO 

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,
and FISTE.


 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO 

THE GALLERY 
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!


 CUT TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 State your name for the record.


 FISTE                     (fidgeting nervously with
                     the green ball)

                 I am Hanover Fiste.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

                 I promised him thirty-five thousand
                 zuleks to testify on my behalf.

 PROSECUTOR 
                 You know the defendant,
                 (pointing)
                 Captain Sternn?


 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing
                 cup, filled with the very cream of

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 

 STERNN                     (to lawyer)

                 See?


 CUT BACK TO

 FISTE 
                 ... in all the time I've known him,

                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...

                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.

With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?

								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT 
                 Ah, what he does not know will not
                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE 
                 Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You gotta use the microphone.


 ZEKE 
                 Oh yeah.
                 (shouts into microphone)
                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary
                 Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify
                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.
                 Here we go.


ZEKE jams the gearshift into hyper-drive.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed
of light.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - LATER 
ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spacecraft looks like an apple
heading toward a freight train as it approaches the
enormous mother-ship.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL CONSOLE 
An ashtray full of roaches sits on the console.  ZEKE is
at the controls with a joint in his mouth.  He is swaying
back and forth, eyes glazed.  Beside him, EDSEL watches
the mothership getting closer.


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You okay to land this thing?


 ZEKE 
                 No problem, man.


 CUT TO 

MOTHERSHIP'S LANDING AREA 
Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide
landing area as the round spaceship glides in.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 I think you're goin' a little high,
                 man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 It's okay, man.  If there's one
                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you
                 know your perspective's fucked,
                 so you just gotta let your hands
                 work the controls as if you're
                 straight.


The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow, good landing, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Thanks.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - ENTRANCE HATCH 
ZEKE and EDSEL press a button to open the hatch doors.
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards
waiting on the other side.  Between them stands a small,
shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and
cauliflower ears.  This is HANOVER FISTE.


 REGOLIAN GUARD                     (to Zeke and Edsel)

                 This man is to be delivered to the,
                 clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom
                 #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln Sternn.
                 Thenk yew.  Clik.


The guards wheel away.


 FISTE                     (meekly)

                 Ah, hello.


 CUT TO 

CORRIDOR IN SPACESHIP 
ZEKE and EDSEL escort FISTE down the corridor.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Umm, you're gonna testify at
                 Sternn's trial?


FISTE nods.


 ZEKE 
                 They gotta give him at least, like,
                 life.


 FISTE 
                 Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable
                 man.
                 (camera pulls close to Fiste's face)
                 He will be freed.


 CUT TO 

SPACE - LATER 
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through
a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past
a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Y'know, I wish they'd clean this place
                 up, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.  It's like pig city out here.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.


 CUT TO 

ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy-
paks.


 ROBOT 
                 ... but I don't understand.  We
                 laugh together.  We care for each
                 other.  We have highly proficient
                 sex.  Why can't we get married?


 GLORIA 
                 Look, we're different, okay?  Let's
                 leave it at that.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL ROOM 
The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through,
still talking.


 GLORIA 
                 ... but mixed marriages just don't
                 work.  What if you get tired of me
                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside
them.


 ZEKE 
                 There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang
                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP 
An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse
floats into view, completely filling the screen.  ZEKE and
EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame,
approaching the mammoth structure.


 CUT TO 

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,
and FISTE.


 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO 

THE GALLERY 
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing

They look at each other, shocked.

                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?
