          FADE IN ON:
          
          
          INT.   DEATH ROW/CELL - DAWN
          
          START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man,
          20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a
          resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST:
          
                               PRIEST
                     Yea, though I walk through the valley
                     of the shadow of death, I will fear
                     no evil: for thou art beside me; thy
                     rod and thy staff they comfort me...
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot,
          staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This
          OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding
          chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING
          MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand.
          
          MARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of
          SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks
          and shuts his bible.
          
          One of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for--
          
          DR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant,
          attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head.
          She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her
          some privacy with Marcus.
          
                               SERENA
                     Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm
                     with Project Angel. You consented to
                     donate your body to science...

                                                                                 2.
          CONTINUED:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.
          
                                 SERENA
                       You've been chosen for our research.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Chosen?    Lucky me.
          
                                 SERENA
                       We just need a couple of signatures...
          
          Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he
          notes that her hands are SHAKING.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       You don't need to be scared.
          
                                   SERENA
                       I'm not.    It's nerve degeneration.
          
          MARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering
          her sparse hair.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Cancer?
          
                                  SERENA
                           (NODS)
                       You're not the only one with a
                       death sentence.
          
          MARCUS meets her eyes.      She studies him a beat.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       What you're doing is important,
                       Marcus. Our work is still highly
                       experimental... but you may be
                       helping people in ways you can't
                       begin to imagine.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm a regular hero.
          
          With that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the
          words "PROJECT ANGEL" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form.
          
          SERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise.         She touches his
          hand for a moment.
                                                                   (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
                                  SERENA
                     Thank you.     And... I'm sorry.
          
                               MARCUS
                     No one lives forever.
          
          THE GUARD sees SERENA out.
          
          
          INT.   DEATH ROW/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          LOW ANGLE - MARCUS' CHAINED ANKLES clank as the GUARDS lead
          him down the corridor, past PRISONERS in their cells; some
          avert their eyes, others give a nod or raise a fist.
          
                               PRIEST (V.O.)
                     Marcus, this is your last
                     opportunity to make a confession...
          
          MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths,
          struggling not to succumb to fear.
          
                               PRIEST (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     Is there nothing you would say to
                     Officer Martinez' family?
          
          
          INT.   DEATH ROW/EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE - BUCKLES TIGHTEN... AN ALCOHOL SWAB on MARCUS'
          FOREARM... A NEEDLE punctures his skin.
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.)
                     What can I say. I was seventeen, I
                     was angry, I was stupid.
          
          FINGERS turn the VALVE to release the LETHAL CHEMICALS.
          
          CLOSE ON MARCUS' EYES, looking up toward--
          
          THE DEADLY I.V., running into his arm.
          
          From this, he looks toward--
          
          HIS REFLECTION in a one-way mirror, the dim shapes of
          WITNESSES beyond.

                       Yeah... I'm sorry about it. I'm
                       sorry about everything. The whole
                       goddamn world...
          
          As the lethal injection takes hold, his POV moves to BRIGHT
          LIGHTS overhead, losing FOCUS and BLEACHING TO WHITE...
          
          From the WHITE SCREEN, a FACE emerges, backlit, blurred--
          it's SERENA. She's in focus for just a moment, leaning INTO
          CAMERA-- then moves OUT OF FRAME.
          
                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

          SOUTH-CENTRAL SECTOR, NORTH AMERICA, 2018
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DUSK
          
          CORNSTALKS as far as the eye can see, rustling in a summer
          breeze. FIGURES are moving within the FIELD. We only make
          them out in SILHOUETTE, but all carry HEAVY RIFLES.
          
          
          INT.   A-10 COCKPIT - DUSK
          
          A COMPUTER TARGETING SCREEN - the FIGURES are HIGHLIGHTED in
          this tactical display, as is an OCTAGONAL HATCH into the
          ground beneath the corn.
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DUSK
          
          THE FIGURES in the corn look up-- we hear an AIRCRAFT
          APPROACH with a JET WHINE--
          
          FWOOM! A MASSIVE CONCUSSION as a BUNKER-BUSTING MISSILE
          BORES into the earth at high-velocity, burrowing deep--
          
          --then a HUGE BLAST - FLAME and DIRT are thrown high in the
          air, many of the FIGURES blown sky-high.
          
          A FLAMING BODY hits the ground IN FG, FACE TO CAMERA... we
          now see it was a STEEL TERMINATOR-- its METAL SKULL BLOWN
          OPEN and SCORCHED, its RED EYES SHATTERED.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          A-10 WARTHOGS-- stubby attack planes-- SCREAM from the sky,
          RAKING THE REMAINING FIGURES with CANNON FIRE, BLASTING THEM
          to bits. These aircraft no longer bear traditional U.S.
          insignia-- they're painted in WILD COLORS, graffiti lettering
          says things like: "BOT BLASTER," "KILL FOR CONNOR," "RAGE
          AGAINST THE MACHINES," etc... Resistance fighters.
          
          Motley military and civilian CHOPPERS LAND in the CORNFIELD,
          disgorging RESISTANCE SOLDIERS. These are human troops in
          high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional
          ASSAULT WEAPONS.
          
          THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind
          the SOLDIERS. The troops run toward--
          
          --AN OPENING which has been blown into the ground, the
          remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker-buster hit.
          
          A surviving TERMINATOR rises from the SINGED CORN, FIRES its
          PLASMA RIFLE--
          
          --DROPPING A SOLDIER. His comrades FIRE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS--
          and BLOW THE ROBOT APART. The LEADER of this assault group
          waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          COLLAPSED CEILINGS, FLAMES, a high-tech installation in
          ruins; RED LIGHTING, distinctive of Skynet environments.
          
          SOLDIERS flick on HELMET LAMPS and make their way carefully
          inside-- pretty deserted. They kick aside rubble to enter--
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/ROBOTIC ROOM - NIGHT
          
          HELMET BEAMS play over BANKS OF ELECTRONICS and--
          
          --a dozen fixed, INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS-- not remotely HUMANOID--
          engaged in mysterious tasks, mechanical arms at work.
          
          THE SOLDIERS rake the room with GUNFIRE-- MACHINERY
          collapses, SPARKS from EXPLODING CIRCUITRY.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          Deeper into the complex, A HEAVY DOOR BLOWS off its hinges.

                       Clear!
          
          SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES run into DOZENS OF GLASS
          CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK LIQUID. The SOLDIERS
          make their way in, alert-- but nothing's moving in here.
          
          THE TEAM LEADER peers into a cylinder, aims his HEADLAMP at--
          
          --A small MASS OF TISSUE floating inside, connected to a
          dense network of FIBER-OPTIC CABLES... it's a HUMAN BRAIN.
          
                                 TEAM LEADER
                       Oh God.
          
          THE TEAM LEADER recoils-- but before he can say more, the
          ROOM SHAKES with a DEAFENING ROAR.
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          A huge ESCAPE SHIP rises straight up from an open HATCHWAY.
          Nearby TROOPS crouch and FIRE after it. THE SHIP PIVOTS in
          mid-air and ROARS OFF, SOLDIERS dodging the ENGINE BLAST.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          THE TEAM LEADER speaks into his headset. The OTHER SOLDIERS
          inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.
          
                                 TEAM LEADER
                       You will not believe the shit we
                       found down here--
          
          As he speaks, CAMERA FINDS a GREEN LED on the ceiling-- which
          suddenly FLASHES RED and BLINKS RAPIDLY--
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          WIDE - AN IMMENSE SUBTERRANEAN BLAST causes a few hundred
          yards square to SWELL and then COLLAPSE.

          A PANICKED PILOT on the radio:

                       --repeat, that was not us! A ship
                       escaped, they musta blown the place
                       themselves! Jesus, a lot of our
                       guys were still down there...
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.
          
          IN FG, FIND the STEEL SKULL of the dead TERMINATOR.
          
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DAY
          
          SAME ANGLE-- the TERMINATOR now half-sunk in mud. A FIELD
          MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from
          RAINDROPS.
          
          Months have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a
          black stubble. RAIN falls.
          
          A PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving.       The MUD
          roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE...
          
          EYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so
          drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure
          rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud
          from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth,
          makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS.
          
          CAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE...
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
                                                                          8.
          
          
          EXT.   PLATEAU - EVENING
          
          BARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a
          slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on
          his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he
          sees in the distance--
          
          A DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble.
          
          
          EXT.   DEAD CITY - NIGHT
          
          MOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground,
          partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a
          rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN.
          
          MOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed,
          faded sign: "BEWARE OF DOG."
          
          WIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS--
          rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted,
          windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell.
          
          MARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this
          block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips.
          
          A COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up
          a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands.
          
          A HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind
          the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket.
          
          MARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a
          cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER.
          
          MARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears
          open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his
          lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame.
          He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush,
          feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly
          disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away.
          
          He rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a
          clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken
          glass: "SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
          
                                                                            9.
          
          
          INT.   RUINED CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
          
          FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and
          rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled
          on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for
          illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a
          RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good.
          
          
          INT.   RUINED BAR - NIGHT
          
          Partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken
          stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now,
          again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the
          broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with--
          
          A DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Hallelujah.
          
          He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the
          floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES,
          instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.
          
                                                      CUT TO BLACK.
          
          MEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs,
          blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR.
          
          --WEBS of TUBES and FIBER-OPTICS FILLS THE FRAME.
          
          --GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA.
          
          --DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves
          INTO FRAME, a look of concentration on her face as she peers
          through the LIQUID, INTO CAMERA. She starts to smile.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   DEAD CITY - DAY
          
          BLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the
          dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK.
          A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT.
          
          MARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her
          expression recalls the beckoning vision.
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                           10.
          CONTINUED:
          
          He runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a
          chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he
          carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds
          the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on.
          
          
          EXT.   HIGHWAY - NIGHT
          
          Deserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels.
          MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT
          NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're
          in mostly flat, treeless plains.
          
          From the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through
          the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the
          first living creatures he's seen. He waves.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       Hey!   Yo, over here!
          
          The FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt
                       like I was the last man on...
          
          He freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T-
          400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA
          RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but
          their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and
          motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan
          him.
          
                                   MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Oh God...
          
          Marcus backs away, runs.      The T-400s stare after him-- but
          don't fire.
          
          ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's
          worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE:
          
                                 BOY
                       Hey mister, where you goin' in such
                       a hurry?
          
          ANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid
          teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                            11.
          CONTINUED:
          
          He wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING.     He
          scrambles quickly down from the sign.
          
          AT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the
          freeway, when--
          
          THE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in
          one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other.
          
                                 BOY (cont'd)
                       Whoah, whoah-- hang on there.   Got
                       any food?
          
          Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head.     The boy looks him
          over dubiously.
          
                                 BOY (cont'd)
                       You look like you been eating
                       pretty good.
          
          The boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus
          with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       You're human... you can see me, you
                       can touch me. This place is real.
          
          THE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS
          from Marcus' pocket.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       I thought I was in hell.
          
                                 BOY
                           (raises an eyebrow)
                       This sure ain't heaven.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Those things with masks, red eyes--
          
                                 BOY
                           (CASUALLY)
                       Terminators-- T-400s.   What is this stuff?
          
          THE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT--
          
          ANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a
          fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of
          a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER.
                                                                (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                           12.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          THE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with
          sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it
          hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the
          gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.
          
                              MARCUS
                    If I'm not in hell, where am I?!
          
                              BOY
                        (CHOKING)
                    Texas!
          
          The NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS--
          
          MARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into
          the boy's cheek. He's face to face with--
          
          A GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the
          shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot.
          
                              GIRL
                    Let him go!
          
                              MARCUS
                    First put down the shotgun.
          
          THE GIRL shakes her head angrily.   She wears an aged, beloved
          BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it.
          
                              BOY
                    Do what he says.
          
                              GIRL
                    He'll kill us both!
          
                              MARCUS
                    I don't wanna kill anyone.
          
                              BOY
                    Do it, Star. Put it down.
          
          She shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus'
          head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.
          
                              GIRL
                    There was only one bullet in that gun.
          
          MARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          13.
          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          --BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg,
          she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. MARCUS tosses the BOY
          at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun
          falling to one side--
          
          MARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun.
          
          Using SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from
          her clothing.
          
          MARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand.   He
          struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.
          
                              MARCUS
                    I don't like it when people point
                    guns at me.
          
                              GIRL
                    It wasn't loaded.
          
          MARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and
          handgun-- indeed, both are empty.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You took on a guy like me with one
                    bullet and an empty shotgun?
                        (studies them admiringly)
                    Pretty stupid.
          
          He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and
          kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught
          FIRE and are incinerated.
          
          THE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus.
          
                              GIRL
                    Can I have my gun back?
          
          MARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up.   He still
          looks at the PICTURES in his hands.
          
                              GIRL (cont'd)
                    Where'd you get those?
          
                              MARCUS
                    In the city.

                              BOY
                        (steps away from him)
                    The city? Oh man. That place is
                    red hot.
          
                              MARCUS
                        (a small smile)
                    Seemed kinda dead to me.
          
                              BOY
                    No-- radiation.
          
          A SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER
          moving in their direction.
          
          Quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL
          OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger.
          
          THE BOY bolts from behind cover, grabs MARCUS by the arm--
          
                              BOY (cont'd)
                    Get down, they've seen the light!
          
          He drags Marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time--
          
          As the H-K nears, the LIGHT FINDS the BURNING OIL. It FIRES
          BLUE PULSES, which CHEW up the asphalt nearby-- then it moves
          on, failing to pick out the humans. Marcus is dumbfounded.
          
                              MARCUS
                    That wasn't a helicopter...
          
                              BOY
                    It's an H-K-- hunter-killer.   Where
                    the hell have you been?
          
                              GIRL
                    Rads musta fried his brains.   Let's
                    go, Kyle.
          
          The H-K has vanished in the distance. The girl rises.   The
          boy-- KYLE-- shakes his head, stays at Marcus' side.
          
                              KYLE
                    What's your name?
          
                              MARCUS

                    Marcus. Marcus Wright.

                     She doesn't remember her name--
                         (re: her cap)
                     --so I call her Star.
          
          STAR gives Marcus a small, reluctant wave.
          
                               KYLE (cont'd)
                     Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better
                     find cover. We spotted some
                     buildings half a mile that way.
          
          KYLE points but gets no response. He shrugs, sets off with
          Star in that direction. Kyle calls over his shoulder:
          
                               KYLE (cont'd)
                     You can come if you want.

                     Why? We don't need him.

                         (a shrug, sotto)
                     I like him. He's funny.
          
          MARCUS looks around at the desolate world-- and the two teens
          receding ahead of him. After a beat, he follows.

          EXT.   REST STOP - DAY
          
          A MEXICAN FAST FOOD JOINT, windows broken, sign collapsed,
          near a two-story MOTEL with a COVERED CARPORT. The pavement
          is CRACKED, the structures WEATHERED, abandoned for a decade.
          
          MARCUS, KYLE and STAR suddenly rise from a hiding spot by a
          DUMPSTER in a parking area. KYLE scans the FAST-FOOD PLACE
          with the binoculars, while STAR studies a WATCH she carries.
          
                                  KYLE
                       Eyeball.   Only one.

          They drop down again.
          
          ONE AEROSTAT patrols the area. It's a surveillance drone the
          size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a
          RED GLOW. It flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every
          few seconds before continuing on. It vanishes around the
          corner of the fast-food joint, moving in the direction of the
          motel. STAR has been timing its moves.
          
                                 STAR
                       Now!
          
          KYLE and STAR dash for the fast-food entrance, MARCUS just
          behind. They round the doorway and--
          
          
          INT.   FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY
          
          --drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a
          taco place, remnants of Mexican decor.
          
          THROUGH A DIRTY WINDOW, they see the AEROSTAT buzz past,
          flying its pattern. It moves on without spotting them, then
          takes off in a new direction.
          
          KYLE and STAR set to searching the place, something they've
          done many times. They go through trash cans, check behind
          the counters and in the kitchen. MARCUS gets up, still
          looking out the windows.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       That flying grapefruit, what was it?
          
                                 KYLE
                       Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes.
                       They patrol places like this,
                       looking for survivors.
          
                                 STAR
                       Yes!
          
          She's come up with some UNOPENED PACKETS OF CONDIMENTS from a
          bag of TRASH. KYLE trots over.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Any red ones?
          
          She nods excitedly, hands him a packet.    He tears it open,
          sucks down the contents eagerly.

          makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside.
          
                                    STAR
                       Yuk!
          
          MARCUS picks up the packet, looks at it.

                       Jalapeño sauce.

                       Well, sort of... a little.
          
          With obvious reluctance, STAR holds a packet of mustard
          toward Marcus.
          
                                    STAR

          Marcus gallantly waves it away.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       No thanks.     Not hungry.

          STAR closes tattered curtains, plops on the bare bed, ready
          for sleep. The room's a mess, GRAFFITI here and there, trash
          scattered about; they're not the first squatters who've been
          here. THE GUNS and STAR'S WATCH lie on a dresser.
          
          KYLE sits before the TV-- he's scratching STICK FIGURES onto
          the screen with a rusted POCKETKNIFE. One is clearly meant
          to be him; the smaller one, wearing a baseball cap, is Star.

                    He's... I don't know. The best.
                    Everybody talks about him. He's
                    the one who's gonna save us.
          
                              MARCUS
                    Yeah, right. Him and Jesus.
          
                              KYLE
                    Who's Jesus?
          
                              MARCUS
                    You're asking the wrong guy.
          
                              KYLE
                        (closing his eyes)
                    So why were you in prison?
          
                              MARCUS
                        (a long beat)
                    I killed a cop.
          
                              KYLE
                    Were cops like terminators?
          
                              MARCUS
                    Well... Nah, some of `em were all right.
                        (SIGHS)
                    My little brother Max, pretty wild
                    kid, not much older than you-- he
                    stole a car, just joy-riding,
                    y'know, showing off.

                     Cop chased him right into our front
                     yard, pulled him outta the car...
                     and started whaling on him, kicking
                     the shit out of him. No reason for
                     it, Max was already in cuffs. I ran
                     out of the house, guy tried to pull
                     his gun on me-- guess I just went
                     off on him. Don't even remember it
                     really... they say I broke his neck.
                         (BEAT)
                     Max must be dead too, now... like
                     everybody else.
          
          MARCUS notices now that Kyle is asleep-- it's as if he's
          lulled him with a bedtime story. Marcus is oddly touched,
          pulls a cover over both the kids. KYLE starts, half-asleep--
          
                               KYLE
                     You gonna be here when I wake up?
          
                                MARCUS
                     Sure.
          
                                KYLE
                     Good.   Stay away from the windows.
          
          So saying, KYLE falls back asleep. MARCUS sighs, moves
          through the room, quietly opens a drawer or two and finds--
          
          A BIBLE.
          
          
          INT.   MOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          AFTERNOON LIGHT, MARCUS sits on the floor by a room door,
          shotgun leaned on the wall at his side. He has the bible
          open in his lap, head bowed over it. CLOSER-- his eyes are
          closed, he's asleep.
          
          THE DOOR OPENS behind him, STAR peers out-- and looks
          relieved to see Marcus is still with them. As she takes a
          step toward him, he starts awake.
          
                                STAR
                     Just me.
          
          MARCUS relaxes, she sits down beside him.

                                  MARCUS
                       The bible. My grandma always tried
                       to get me into it, but-- it always
                       put me to sleep.

                       Would you read something to me?
          
          MARCUS shrugs and nods, flips to a random page, squints at
          the text.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       "...of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat

                       There's a book inside with pictures.
          
          She's already on her feet.
          
          CLOSE - A PHONEBOOK, minutes later.    We hear MARCUS reading:

                       "Guaranteed lowest prices... open
                       seven days..."
          
          STAR sits at his side, looking over his shoulder as he turns
          pages. She points to something:
          
                                 STAR
                       What's that?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       It's a flower. A rose.

                           (full of wonder)
                       So... all those numbers... you
                       could call them and get, like,
                       flowers, or someone to come over
                       and fix stuff, or bring you food...

          Star's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along:
          
                              MARCUS & STAR
                    "How I wonder what you are... up
                    above the world so high, like a
                    diamond in the sky..."
          
          STAR is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You OK?

          MARCUS puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and
          she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes.

          AEROSTAT POV - a PIXELLATED ELECTRONIC IMAGE as it patrols
          the MOTEL AREA in its geometric pattern. It ZOOMS into the
          CARPORT, quickly scanning the abandoned VEHICLES, among which
          is an aged, open JEEP WRANGLER, its HOOD UP, parked beside a
          customized VAN. The cars are covered in DUST, the TIRES
          FLAT, they've been sitting here for a decade.
          
          OBJECTIVE ANGLE - the AEROSTAT zips off on its rounds. After
          a moment, the VAN DOOR slides open. MARCUS moves quickly
          back to the JEEP, KYLE and STAR behind him.
          
          STAR checks her WATCH while MARCUS goes back to work on the
          JEEP'S ENGINE. He's found some tools, already has removed
          and cleaned SPARK PLUGS, dismantled the DISTRIBUTOR. KYLE,
          meanwhile, returns to INFLATING one of the tires with a
          BICYCLE PUMP.
          
                               KYLE

                     It's called driving.   Sure.
          
          STAR wipes DIRT off the side of the VAN, revealing air-

                     Wow.   What were these like?
          
          MARCUS looks up from his work to see--
          
          A WHITE UNICORN in a FIELD OF FLOWERS.

                     Now!
          
          THE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat
          inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the
          other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up.
          
          They get the vehicle to a slight SLOPE, it begins to roll on
          its own.
          
                               MARCUS

          ANGLE IN JEEP
          
          We see it's been hot-wired. STAR has her foot all the way
          down on the clutch, now lets up--
          
          THE JEEP BUCKS and SPUTTERS... but CATCHES. As soon as it
          does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL,
          the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS. MARCUS runs for the
          driver's side, but the JEEP is pulling ahead fast.
          
          ANGLE IN JEEP
          
          STAR is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of
          the MUSIC. When she looks out the windshield--
          
          --she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror--
          
          --MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the
          wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral.
          
                               KYLE
                     Aerostat's coming!
          
          KYLE hops in back as MARCUS adjusts the seat and FLOORS IT.
          THE KIDS are exhilarated as MARCUS zooms out of there,
          heading off-road across the plains, LIGHTS OFF, MUSIC LOUD.
          
                                 STAR
                     Music...

          MARCUS turns the MUSIC DOWN.       He looks up to see--
          
          --THE AEROSTAT, right over their heads, keeping pace with the
          vehicle, RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
          
          KYLE rises in back, SWINGS at it with the SHOTGUN BUTT--
          
          THE AEROSTAT deftly dodges the blows.
          
                                 STAR
                       Oh no! It's gonna call a
                       Harvester, we're dead--
          
          MARCUS SLAMS on the brakes-- the AEROSTAT stops a few feet
          ahead of them, hovering in the air.
          
          MARCUS picks up an X-shaped LUG WRENCH from behind his seat,
          rises, taking aim--
          
          --and HURLS THE WRENCH with amazing speed and power--
          
          --it flies like a throwing star and SMASHES the AEROSTAT to
          BITS in a shower of SPARKS and METAL.
          
          The three of them stare breathlessly for a moment.
          
                                  KYLE
                       Wow.   You're good.
          
          MARCUS flexes his hand, startled at his own strength.
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   TEXAS PLAINS - NIGHT
          
          The JEEP moves off-road, HEADLIGHTS OFF, traveling by
          MOONLIGHT. It SWERVES and BUCKS from time to time. MUSIC
          PLAYS from the TAPE DECK, something more melodic.
          
          ANGLE IN JEEP - KYLE behind the wheel, having the time of his
          life, MARCUS supervising, STAR enjoying the breeze and the
          unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle.
          
                                   STAR
                       Faster!
          
                                   MARCUS
                       No!    You're doing fine.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE. MARCUS ejects
          the tape, pulls it out-- it's unspooled, tangled in the
          stereo's guts. THE KIDS groan disappointedly. STATIC from
          the radio now... but a FAINT VOICE audible beneath it.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Ssh.
          
          MARCUS FIDDLES with the dial. He can't get the SOUND clear,
          rolls through the dial. Varying levels of STATIC, then a
          relatively CLEAR VOICE:
          
                                 RADIO VOICE
                       --proper ratio of ammonium nitrate
                       to diesel fuel. A bomb of this
                       type can be contained in an
                       ordinary plastic garbage bag, and
                       will detonate on impact...

          STAR points toward the horizon.    Marcus looks up.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Stop the car.
          
          KYLE ACCELERATES.

                       Other pedal, other pedal!
          
          They SCREECH to a halt.
          
          IN THE DISTANCE - a RED GLOW of FLAMES far away. SILHOUETTED
          against this, strange FLYING VEHICLES and spindly, spider-
          like MACHINES are just visible.

          HIGH ANGLE - THE JEEP turns away from the conflagration,
          moves off in a new direction and vanishes into the darkness.

          TANKER on flat tires, the cab long gone.   MOVE TO FIND the
          JEEP approaching off-road.
          
          THE JEEP pulls to a stop, MARCUS gets out from behind the
          wheel and moves to the TANKER. STAR and KYLE, with his
          binocs, scan the area for signs of Skynet surveillance.
          
                               KYLE
                     We oughta find a place to hole up
                     for the day...
          
          MARCUS pounds on the TANKER-- a deep echo.
          
                                 MARCUS
                     Damn it.    Empty.
          
          KYLE sniffs the air.
          
                               KYLE
                     You smell that?
          
          STAR sniffs the air herself, eyes going wide.

                     Food!
          
          They both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE,
          each carrying their unloaded GUNS.
          
          HIGH ANGLE - from BEHIND THE RUSTING SIGN, an AEROSTAT
          appears, aimed at the kids, LIGHTS BLINKING.

          INT.   SERVICE STATION - DAWN
          
          KYLE and STAR slither under a partially open GARAGE DOOR.
          The space is dark, SMOKE-FILLED... STRIPS OF DRIED MEAT hang
          from the hydraulic lift. The two youths look amazed and
          delighted. Kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to
          the closest strip and PEELS OFF A PIECE, takes a tentative
          bite, then gnaws ravenously. Star leans the shotgun against
          the wall and follows suit.
          
          MARCUS lifts the garage door and enters, DAWN LIGHT streaming
          in behind him.
          
                               MARCUS
                     What is this?
          
                                KYLE
                         (mouth full)
                     Who cares?
          
          Marcus squints at something in the darkness.   He takes a step
          forward, then grabs Star's arm.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Spit it out!
          
                                STAR
                         (CHEWING)
                     It's good!
          
          Now KYLE reacts to what Marcus saw, GAGS and SPITS out meat.
          He's staring at--
          
          --a dried, severed HUMAN HAND, resting on a GRILLE in the
          sunken SERVICE PIT, where a CHARCOAL FIRE smolders.
          
          Star sees it too, turns and RETCHES, just as--
          
          --three animal-like CANNIBALS emerge from the back of the
          garage-- two burly, ugly, unshaven MEN and a wild-eyed,
          unhealthy-looking WOMAN with matted hair. We'll call them
          PIG, BULL and COW. PIG grabs the SHOTGUN, BULL grabs KYLE
          and yanks the HANDGUN from his waistband.
          
          COW grabs STAR, shoves her into the center of the garage,
          beside Kyle and Bull. Bull tosses the handgun to COW who
          keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up.

          PIG eyes Marcus, points the shotgun in his face.
          
                                 PIG
                       This one's fi-i-ine--
          
          MARCUS raises two fingers like a peace sign-- then shoves
          them into the barrels of the shotgun. PIG snorts and PULLS
          THE TRIGGER-- CLICK.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Oops.
          
          MARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS
          Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose.
          
          COW points the unloaded HANDGUN at Marcus-- CLICK CLICK.
          
          KYLE and STAR get free of BULL and dash for the exit, they're
          out of there in a flash.
          
          BULL CHARGES MARCUS, who dodges him, grabs the man and--
          
          --HURLS HIM HEAD FIRST into the CHARCOAL PIT-- his BODY
          SIZZLES against the coals, he SCREAMS and WRITHES.
          
          COW picks up an AXE with two hands and SWINGS it at MARCUS
          who GRABS the HANDLE with one hand and YANKS it away.
          
          COW knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out
          the way Kyle and Star went.
          
          MARCUS advances on PIG and BULL, brandishing the AXE. Pig
          squirms back across the floor, wiping BLOOD from his face.
          
                                 PIG
                       We didn't kill `em! I swear to
                       God, they was dead already, we
                       wasn't gonna let `em rot--
          
          BULL has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much
          pain to rise.
          
                                 BULL
                       Go `head, take as much as you want,
                       we're on the same side here--

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          Marcus looks ready to finish them off-- but reacts to CRIES
          from outside, a loud MECHANICAL RUMBLE.
          
          
          EXT.   SERVICE STATION - DAY
          
          A HARVESTER-- a GIANT INSECT-LIKE TERMINATOR-- is outside the
          station. Many times the size of a human being, MULTIPLE ARMS
          and LEGS sprout from its thorax, it has multiple CAMERA EYES
          on long, swiveling stalks-- it carries KYLE and STAR, the
          kids struggle frantically, caught in the harvester's jointed
          steel appendages.
          
          One unblinking EYE SCANS KYLE, another STAR; the harvester
          produces a NEEDLE from one of its arms, INJECTS the boy-- who
          instantly goes limp, unconscious. It does the same to STAR.
          
          As COW emerges--
          
          --THE HARVESTER SPRINGS on her, with startling speed. She
          SCREAMS as the enormous terminator hoists her into the air
          with the others, INJECTS her and begins moving toward--
          
          --A TRANSPORT. This consists of CONTAINER resembling a semi-
          trailer or wheeled dumpster, attached within a FRAMEWORK that
          features movable ENGINE PODS and a mysterious ARMATURE at the
          front. A STEEL LID in the top of the container OPENS
          hydraulically, the Harvester DEPOSITS the HUMAN CAPTIVES
          inside, and the LID SLAMS SHUT.
          
          MARCUS has emerged from the garage, still carrying the AXE.
          He stays low, hidden behind the tanker, watching as--
          
          --PIG and BULL flee through a back entrance to the garage,
          immediately attracting the attention of--
          
          --the Harvester, which sets off in pursuit.
          
          Marcus comes to a decision.    He SPRINTS into the open, toward
          the TRANSPORT, and--
          
          --CLAMBERS up the side, hitting the thing at full speed,
          using an engine pod to boost himself higher. He's still
          short but swings the AXE and--
          
          --hooks the AXE HEAD over the top of the container, like a
          grappling hook. He pulls himself up and--
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          32.
          CONTINUED:
          
          --crawls across the roof, to the LID. There's a barred,
          reinforced MESH PANEL here, through which he can see--
          
          ANGLE IN TRANSPORT
          
          --about TWENTY HUMAN PRISONERS, unconscious on the steel
          floor. Among them are KYLE and STAR. Star MOANS, opens her
          eyes briefly and sees--
          
          --MARCUS' SILHOUETTE above her.
          
          Her eyes flutter shut again.
          
          MARCUS struggles to raise the sealed lid, but there's no
          purchase available, just a smooth seam. Suddenly--
          
          --the TRANSPORT JERKS. MARCUS nearly loses his footing as
          the TRANSPORT STARTS ROLLING forward. He drops to his belly,
          seeing that the transport is approaching--
          
          --the HARVESTER, which now carries PIG and BULL, both
          unconscious. THE LID OPENS and the Harvester DROPS the two
          men INSIDE-- but its camera eyes fail to register Marcus, who
          crouches behind the open lid. As the lid BEGINS TO CLOSE,
          the Harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the
          transport, making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine.
          
          MARCUS THRUSTS THE HEAD OF THE AXE under the closing LID in
          order to prevent it from sealing. THE LID grinds against it,
          but remains ajar. A moment later--
          
          --THE ENGINE PODS ROTATE DOWNWARD, FIRE and--
          
          --THE TRANSPORT LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Within moments, the
          airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air.
          
          
          EXT.   AERIAL - DAY
          
          MARCUS moves to the edge, looks down in astonishment at the
          fallow plains far below. Looking to the side, he sees--
          
          --A PAIR OF HUNTER KILLERS, swooping in quickly to provide an
          escort for the slower moving transport.
          
          WIND buffets Marcus, he hangs on for dear life. Clinging to
          the top of the transport, he slowly makes his way back toward
          the LID. As the transport BANKS, he almost loses his grasp,
          dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself.

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his
          might. This thing is really heavy, plus he's fighting the
          WIND BLAST. MARCUS hears something behind him--
          
          THE HARVESTER has spotted him and is now prying itself loose
          from the armature. Also buffeted by the wind, it starts to
          move gingerly down the length of the transport toward Marcus.
          
          MARCUS must let the LID CLOSE. He snatches up the AXE, takes
          a couple of WHACKS at the thing, DENTING the metal, but doing
          no serious damage. The Harvester KNOCKS the weapon out of
          his hand, Marcus has no choice but to keep backing away.
          
          MARCUS is driven to the back of the transport. Struggling
          for handholds, he lowers himself out of sight, down the
          framework along the side, getting out of the wind. Suddenly--
          
          --STEEL CLAWS WRAP around him FROM BELOW, YANK him downward.
          
          THE HARVESTER has crawled around the SIDE of the TRANSPORT,
          and under the BOTTOM, in order to GRAB HIM. The hideous
          machine now holds him in its clutches, hundreds of feet in
          the air, its CAMERA EYES fixed on him.
          
          THE HARVESTER produces its needle, it's coming at his face--
          but MARCUS frees one hand, grabs the syringe, managing to
          hold it back, inches from his skin. His strength is
          weakening, but as the Harvester makes its final thrust--
          
          --he JERKS the NEEDLE to one side and it BENDS against one of
          the Harvester's own steel limbs.
          
          Undaunted, the creature crawls up the side of the transport,
          Marcus still in its clutches. It moves to the lid, which
          OPENS. It lets go of Marcus to drop him inside when--
          
          --MARCUS seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the
          harvester's back, where he--
          
          --GRABS a couple of EYE STALKS, trying to RIP them from the
          harvester's thorax, LOOSE WIRES SPARK. The Harvester twists
          and thrashes, it's like he's a rodeo rider. A LIMB wraps
          around him, starting to CRUSH him in a vise-like grip, when
          SUDDENLY--
          
          --CANNON FIRE RIPS through the towering HARVESTER, blowing
          its thorax to PIECES, barely MISSING MARCUS.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          A PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack
          aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either
          side of the transport.
          
          THE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport,
          still clutching MARCUS and--
          
          --CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both
          suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE
          BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the
          engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it
          now, to keep from falling.
          
          The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance
          planes.
          
          A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily
          armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS.
          CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE
          PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank.
          
          An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the
          ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying
          erratically, heading downward and--
          
          --CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL.
          
          
          EXT.   AERIAL & RIVER - DAY
          
          The planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES. On
          the far banks, even from above, we see ominous MILITARY
          FORTIFICATIONS-- CONCRETE BUNKERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, etc.
          
          MARCUS meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead Harvester,
          avoid the ENGINE BLAST and find a handhold on the transport.
          
          THE A-10 that shot down the H-K comes around for another pass
          at the transport, but--
          
          --ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS at the far side of the river let out a
          VOLLEY of BLUE PLASMA-FIRE. The BURSTS arc toward the A-10,
          which swerves and climbs, but--
          
          --PLASMA FIRE destroys a wing, the A-10 SPINS out of control.
          
          THE OTHER A-10 breaks off its dogfight with its H-K and
          speeds away from the river.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the
          transport, he reaches out and--
          
          --THE FRIED HARVESTER suddenly dislodges from the ENGINE POD,
          taking Marcus with it, into FREEFALL.
          
          WITH MARCUS, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet
          below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing
          the river.
          
          MARCUS' POV - the ground and treetops getting closer. At the
          last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him OVER
          THE RIVER and--
          
          MARCUS and the DEAD HARVESTER HIT THE WATER, hard, vanishing
          below the surface with enormous SPLASHES.
          
          The surviving H-K and the TRANSPORT continue across the river
          into Skynet territory, vanishing in the distance.
          
          CAMERA MOVES to FIND a PARACHUTE, drifting earthward on the
          unfortified side of the river.
          
          
          EXT.   RIVERBANK - DUSK
          
          HOLD ON LAPPING WATER for a beat.      Then--
          
          --MARCUS breaks the surface, staggering toward shore, he
          drops to his knees in the shallows.
          
          WAKES APPEAR behind him. Hearing the water stir, Marcus
          turns to see numerous DARK SHAPES moving rapidly in on him,
          from different directions, FLASHES OF METAL visible beneath
          the surface. These are HYDROBOTS-- AQUATIC TERMINATORS-- but
          we don't get a good look at them (yet) and Marcus isn't
          sticking around. He scrambles for the riverbank and makes
          his way into the leafless trees.
          
          
          EXT.   TREES - EVENING
          
          MARCUS moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks
          over the water in the direction the transport took.
          
                                  BLAIR (O.S.)
                       Yo!   Up here!

          CONTINUED:
          
          BLAIR WILLIAMS, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from
          the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees
          about fifteen feet in the air above Marcus.
          
          MARCUS moves closer.    Blair struggles to saw through her
          lines with a KNIFE.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       Who are you--
          
          The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.
          
          Marcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an
          instant and CATCHES HER. He holds her in his arms:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Name's Marcus.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You can put me down now, Marcus.
          
          He does so. Blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short.
          She's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no-nonsense,
          battle-hardened member of the Resistance. She pulls a
          COMPASS from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she
          orients herself.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       I've got an ELT, but I can't call
                       for a rescue here. There's an
                       outpost a few miles upriver-- not
                       my favorite people in the world,
                       but it's safe. Let's move.
          
          Blair is already moving, Marcus hesitates, then points across
          the water.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm heading that way.
          
                                 BLAIR
                           (a short laugh)
                       The hot zone? No you're not.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I've got to get to my friends--
          
                                 BLAIR
                       What friends?

                              MARCUS
                    Couple of kids. They were in that
                    flying dumpster--
          
                              BLAIR
                    The Skynet transport? It was
                    carrying people?
                        (off his nod)
                    Christ, we almost shot it down.
                    There've been rumors about a
                    concentration camp, but...
          
          She shakes her head, gestures toward the river.
          
                              BLAIR (cont'd)
                    You can't get across-- river's
                    fulla hydrobots--
          
                                 MARCUS
                    Hydrobots?
          
                              BLAIR
                    They can't see, but they have killer
                    sonar. They'll attack anything that
                    moves or makes a sound. Even if you
                    get past them, you'd be dead before
                    you covered a hundred yards. If the
                    terminators don't get you, the fallout
                    will-- heavy rads all the way to the
                    Gulf coast, nothing can live there.
          
          Marcus absorbs this, starts walking with her.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You're with the Resistance.
          
                              BLAIR
                    Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what
                    used to be the Air National Guard.
          
          She puts a hand out, listening.   She signals for him to lay
          low, behind a fallen tree.
          
          NEARBY-- a pair of T-1s on patrol rumble into view. They
          pause, scanning the area, chain-guns at the ready. They
          start to move toward BLAIR and MARCUS' hiding place.
          
          BLAIR quickly grabs a STONE and, staying down, hurls it as
          far away as she can--
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          THE STONE strikes a few BRANCHES--
          
          THE T-1s suddenly turn in that direction, GUNS BLAZING--
          
          THE WOODS in the immediate vicinity are torn to pieces by the
          GUNFIRE, small FIRES erupt from the incendiary bullets-- it's
          definitely overkill.
          
          THE T-1s roll over to inspect the damage, out of view.
          
          BLAIR whispers:
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Stupid bastards. Come on.
          
          She and Marcus move away quickly, away from the trees.    When
          they're a safe distance from the robots--
          
                               MARCUS
                     I don't know... this has gotta be
                     some kind of, like, dream or
                     hallucination. Like what happens
                     to people right before they die...
          
          Blair SLUGS him hard, in the arm.     He doesn't flinch, but he
          looks surprised.
          
                               BLAIR
                     That snap you out of it?
          
          MARCUS shakes his head.   They keep walking.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Well hell, maybe you are dreaming. Do
                     us all a favor and wake up already.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT.   MUTANT FOREST - NIGHT
          
          THE MOON over a scrubby forest, trees just a few feet high.
          BLAIR and MARCUS seem like giants as they move among them.
          They've been talking a while, Blair's absorbing something.
          
                               BLAIR
                     So let me get this straight, Marcus.
                     There you are on death row, they stick
                     a needle in your arm...

                       Whatever they pumped into your veins just
                       knocked you out. This Angel Project you

                       body like yours go to waste?
          
          She's looking him over as she says this, it almost sounds
          flirtatious. Marcus changes the subject.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I've never seen trees like these.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       We're in a mutation zone. I saw a
                       two-headed squirrel here once--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Freaky.
          
                                 BLAIR
                           (SHRUGS)
                       Tasted like chicken.
          
          BLAIR pauses, checking a small GEIGER COUNTER she carries--
          it CLICKS a bit.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       Levels are tolerable now, but just.
                       We can't spend the night here.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          They start moving again.   Marcus pauses, listens:
          
                              MARCUS
                    What was that?
          
                              BLAIR
                    I didn't hear anything--
          
          Now they both hear an eerie HOWL, changing in pitch-- like a
          coyote on crack. More than one picks up the CHORUS.
          
                                BLAIR (cont'd)
                    Skindogs.
          
          She pulls a SIDEARM, holds it at the ready as she starts
          running, away from the direction of the noise. Marcus keeps
          up at her side, looking behind them.
          
          WITH THE DOGS
          
          We don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large
          BEASTS moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the
          fleeing humans.
          
          BLAIR sees they won't outrun them. She spins, FIRES in the
          direction of the approaching PACK. Suddenly it's quiet-- the
          animals fan out, forming a circle around Blair and Marcus.
          
                              MARCUS
                    They're surrounding us.
          
          QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED
          TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.
          
                              BLAIR
                    They're smart. And they don't
                    scare easy.
          
          After a few tense beats, from the foliage--
          
          A SKINDOG leaps at BLAIR from behind-- it's hideous, the size
          of a Great Dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and
          long, catlike CLAWS. Before Blair can react, MARCUS leaps
          between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the
          throat. It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages
          to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward--
          
          TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          BLAIR FIRES a few SHOTS at the encroaching pack, we hear a
          few YELPS--
          
          MARCUS protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more SKINDOGS
          aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches.
          
          The other SKINDOGS turn on dead and injured pack members,
          begin TEARING INTO THEM. There's an opening now, the two
          humans make a run for it.
          
          BLAIR catches her breath, looking him over, seriously
          impressed by his strength and calm.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     You saved my ass. Thanks.
          
          MARCUS shrugs, turns back to see the feeding frenzy.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Dog eat dog world.
          
          
                                                         DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   NORMAL FOREST - NIGHT
          
          It's darker now, the moon is down. MARCUS and BLAIR move
          gingerly-- she TRIPS, he catches her before she falls.
          
                                BLAIR
                     Thanks.
          
          BLAIR sighs, yawns, sits against a tree.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     It's not far, but we'll never get
                     across the mine field at night.
                     Might as well STAF till morning.
          
          MARCUS nods, sits a few feet away from her.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite.
          
          MARCUS slides toward her, she nestles against him.
          
                                MARCUS
                     Staf?   What's that mean?

                       It's a resistance term.    Sit tight
                       and fuck.
          
          Soon they're kissing passionately.      But MARCUS pulls away,
          rolls onto his back.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       You holding out for lipstick?
                       Lingerie? Or am I not your... type?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm not gay. In prison, I thought
                       about puss-- women all the time. But
                       now... it's not working. Who knows,
                       all those years on ice...
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Maybe it's just gonna take some time.
                       Before you're completely thawed out.
          
          She's slipped a hand inside his pocket for warmth... now she
          pulls out the SCRAPS of paper, with women's faces. She
          squints at these in the dark.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       What are these?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I dunno. They just... sorta
                       reminded me of her.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Who?
          
          MARCUS speaks carefully, unsure how to articulate this.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There's a woman, the last woman I
                       saw before... when I was under, the
                       dead time-- she kept coming to me.
                       I think she must've saved me.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       I can't compete with that.

          She closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against
          his chest. Marcus stares up into the darkness.

          DARKNESS. We just make out KYLE and STAR among the other
          PRISONERS, most of whom are awake now in the steel container.
          Star still wears her baseball cap. The prisoners are JOSTLED
          as the transport touches down.
          
                               KYLE

          EXT.   LOADING ZONE - NIGHT
          
          The TRANSPORT has landed amongst numerous CONTAINERS, CRANES
          and VEHICLES-- all is dimly lit, enveloped in a vague reddish
          HAZE. THE FLYING FRAMEWORK and ARMATURE detach from the
          TRANSPORT, and TAKE OFF into the air again-- leaving the
          trailer-like wheeled CONTAINER. Something resembling the CAB
          of a semi-truck backs into position, latching onto attachment
          points on the container.
          
          
          INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT
          
          --A SMALL PANEL SLIDES OPEN   at the front of the transport,
          and a half-dozen PROCESSING   AEROSTATS buzz inside from the
          cab. These are larger than    the spy drones, with attached
          PINCERS that can encircle a   person's arm.
          
          PRISONERS duck, try to dodge these things. But they quickly
          buzz from captive to captive, latching onto their arms-- we
          hear SCREAMS, see FLASHES OF LIGHT from the aerostats.
          
          KYLE tries to bat away an AEROSTAT, but its PINCERS latch
          onto his forearm. A SIZZLING SOUND-- Kyle CRIES OUT with the
          pain, a flash of RED LIGHT-- then the aerostat DETACHES and
          moves to its next victim.
          
          STAR gets the same treatment from a different AEROSTAT.   She
          moves to Kyle's side, tears in her eyes, sucking on her
          burned wrist to ease the pain.

                       I don't know...
          
          KYLE looks grimly down at--
          
          --a fresh BAR CODE seared into his arm.
          
          
          EXT.   LOADING ZONE/HIGHWAY - NIGHT
          
          THE CAB and CONTAINER, now resembling a semi, pulls out of
          the loading area. Digitally controlled, it needs no
          headlights as it rolls in the near-darkness.
          
          OVERHEAD ANGLE as the vehicle moves onto a cloverleaf access
          ramp leading to a HIGH SPEED SUNKEN HIGHWAY, a river of fast-
          moving TRAFFIC heading in both directions-- unlit vehicles
          moving close together at 120 mph through the reddish gloom.

          step over undergrowth. CAMERA MOVES to find a STRAND OF
          BARBED WIRE, emerging from the dirt a few feet away.
          
          MARCUS pauses, almost having stepped on a WATERMELON.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       We're in somebody's garden.
          
          BLAIR stops walking, alarmed, a few feet away from him.

          reveal it's behind as well as ahead of them. They've come
          through a gap where the wire had fallen.

          dark, muttered CURSES-- then a MATCH lights a CANDLE.
          BARNES, 20-ish, good-looking and cocky, yawns and sneers,
          annoyed at being awakened. TWO WOMEN share his mattress.

                       Start up the generator, Barnes.
          
          MORRISON is bearded, long-haired, bleary-eyed, a middle-aged
          man in charge here. He sits up in bed, also beside A COUPLE
          OF WOMEN. This place has become an underground crash pad,
          communal living for about a dozen people-- Morrison and
          Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few
          CHILDREN of varying age.
          
          BARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY
          OUT in protest. He wraps it around himself, carries the
          candle as he steps around other SLEEPING FIGURES, makes his
          way toward a METAL STAIRCASE winding downward. Moments
          later, we hear a GAS ENGINE start up-- LIGHTS flicker on.
          
          The place is pretty grimy and run-down, but it was once a
          military environment. There's a BANK OF TV MONITORS against
          one wall, which COME TO LIFE. A couple of the WOMEN move
          toward the adjacent NURSERY AREA to tend to the babies-- one
          of them, LISA, moves to the TV MONITORS. She squints at one.
          
                                 LISA
                       We got company!

          ON A SCREEN
          
          MARCUS and BLAIR in the exact positions we last saw them,
          looking exhausted. They CRY OUT, unheard.
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - DAY
          
          BARNES pokes his head up from a concealed TRAPDOOR thirty
          yards from BLAIR and MARCUS, who are hoarse from shouting.
          
                                 BARNES
                       Blair? Good to see you.
                           (off her glare)
                       What's the password?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Eat shit and die, Barnes!
          
                                 BARNES
                       Close enough. Who's your friend?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Could you get us outta here please?
          
                                 BARNES
                       Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in
                       a mine field.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You didn't maintain the perimeter!
                       Where are your sentries?
          
                                 BARNES
                       It's too early for that military crap.
          
          BARNES consults a MAP, turning it to orient himself.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       OK, if you keep walking straight
                       you're gonna get blown all to
                       hell... turn to your left and take,
                       oh... five steps.
          
          BLAIR and MARCUS obey, moving cautiously.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       OK, face me now. Three steps.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          They do as told.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       Almost home. Turn to your right
                       and take another five steps...
          
          They slowly pace five steps.      On the fifth one, there's a
          CLICK beneath Marcus' foot--
          
          A horrified moment of eye contact between him and Blair-- she
          DIVES TO THE GROUND, away from him as--
          
          BOOM!   MARCUS is thrown through the air by the EXPLOSION--
          
          MARCUS' BODY lands a few feet from the trap door.
          
          
          INT.    OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          Frantic action-- the unconscious MARCUS is carried down a
          corridor from the open trap door by BARNES, MORRISON and a
          couple of women, NANCY and LISA. BLAIR, bleeding from
          shrapnel injuries, assists. She yells at BARNES:
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You goddamn idiot!
          
                                 BARNES
                       He was takin' bigger steps!
          
                                 MORRISON
                       Son of a bitch is heavy.
          
          
          INT.    OUTPOST/INFIRMARY - DAY
          
          MARCUS is deposited gingerly on a METAL TABLE in this crude
          MEDICAL AREA. Numerous INFANTS and TODDLERS about.
          
          JANE, a doctor, moves toward MARCUS with scissors and other
          medical tools, cuts away a tattered pants leg, the shreds of
          his sneaker. She stops and stares, palpates a BLACKENED LEG
          briefly. She looks up in alarm.
          
                                 JANE
                       He stepped on a Claymore? This guy
                       oughta be in a hundred pieces...
          
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          She takes a scalpel, pulls it across the CHARRED, HEAT-
          DEFORMED SKIN. It doesn't even leave an incision.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       What are you doing?
          
                                 JANE
                       Does he have a prosthetic limb?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       I don't think so.
          
          JANE opens Marcus' shrapnel-torn shirt, takes the scalpel and
          gingerly pulls it across the flesh of his chest. No effect.
          
                                 JANE
                       This is not skin... oh Jesus-- oh God--
          
          JANE looks at MORRISON, backing away from Marcus.
          
                                 JANE (cont'd)
                       He's a terminator.
          
                                                         CUT TO BLACK.
          
          MEMORY MONTAGE: QUICK SHOTS-- altered, impressionistic, as
          before. SFX of STATIC, high-pitched, complex DIGITAL NOISE.
          
          --a detached, fleshless metal framework for a ROBOTIC HAND is
          suspended by wires-- it FLEXES, forming a FIST.
          
          --CAMERA CIRCLES a muscular MALE TORSO, without arms, legs or
          head. METALLIC ATTACHMENT POINTS await these missing parts.
          
          --the inside of MARCUS' FACE, a thin membrane of artificial
          skin with eye, nose and mouth holes, is lowered through an
          AQUEOUS environment TOWARD CAMERA.
          
          THROUGH AN EYEHOLE we see SERENA, face distorted by the
          LIQUID. She looks worried. We hear her MUFFLED VOICE:
          
                                 SERENA
                       Why isn't he conscious?
                       Something's wrong, he should be
                       coming out of it by now...
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - DAY
          
          START TIGHT ON MARCUS as he opens his eyes, a beam of bright
          SUNLIGHT in his face. CAMERA PULLS BACK and ROTATES to
          reveal that he is suspended UPSIDE-DOWN from a winch by a two-
          inch thick STEEL CABLE.
          
          MARCUS thrashes, trying to free himself, then looks up and
          sees that--
          
          --the CABLES are strung through HEAVY STEEL BOLTS which have
          been DRILLED THROUGH HIS CALVES, locking them together. His
          FOREARMS have been immobilized in the same grotesque fashion.
          
          From above, the BEAM OF SUNLIGHT shines through the narrow
          crack between an enormous pair of SLIDING STEEL PANELS.
          
          MARCUS twists his neck to look downward--
          
          MARCUS' POV-- a circular pit below, the dark bottom invisible
          to him-- he's hanging near the top of an empty MISSILE SILO,
          its ICBM launched years ago.
          
          At one edge of the silo pit, near scaffolding and tool carts,
          SMALL CHILDREN have gathered to stare. Also there is BARNES--
          he leans back, eyes closed, in a folding chair, with an RPG
          in his lap. One of the KIDS taps Barnes' leg and he jerks
          upright. He immediately trains his weapon on MARCUS, clearly
          nervous now that the terminator is conscious.
          
          MARCUS stares at Barnes, deadpan, for a beat.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Boo!
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON X-RAYs of MARCUS' TORSO and LIMBS-- clearly
          mechanical gears, steel plating, hydraulics, etc.
          
                               JANE
                     Thermoplastic skin, some larger
                     hydraulics, but mostly titanium
                     microgears... This looks like some sort
                     of aeration and hydration system,
                     function unclear at this point. Valves
                     and what looks like an access panel
                     below the ribcage...
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          WIDER, JANE holds up an X-ray of his SKULL, which shows
          almost nothing.
          
                                 JANE (cont'd)
                       Eyes are polymer optics, very lifelike.
                       Lead shielding all around the skull,
                       presumably to protect the CPU.
          
          MATTRESSES have been piled to one side, we now see framed,
          cracked and yellowing POSTERS of MILITARY EQUIPMENT-- AIR
          FORCE JETS, ATLAS ROCKETS, etc. These are interspersed with
          crude CHILDREN'S DRAWINGS on the walls.
          
          BLAIR sits at a battered dining table, surrounded by angry
          outpost RESIDENTS, including JANE and MORRISON.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Whatever he is-- he's on our side--
          
                                 MORRISON
                       How can he be?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       He saved my life!
          
                                 MORRISON
                       Winning your trust would aid his
                       infiltration.
          
          At the communications area by the TVs, LISA wears a HEADSET,
          speaking into a SHORTWAVE RADIO. She calls to the others:
          
                                 LISA
                       Regional doesn't know what to do.
                       They're gonna patch us through to
                       Command Los Angeles.
          
          NANCY, an overwrought older WOMAN, gets in Blair's face,
          pointing at the X-rays.
          
                                 NANCY

          BLAIR is first to reach the edge of the silo, horrified at
          the sight of the dangling MARCUS. BARNES keeps the RPG
          trained on him, they shout over each other.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Get me the hell down from here!

                     Marcus, I'm so sorry...
          
          MORRISON and the OTHERS join them, eyes fixed on Marcus.
          
                               BARNES
                     It keeps talkin' at me. God this
                     thing gives me the creeps.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Why are you doing this?    What is
                     this place?
          
                               MORRISON
                     We're trying to--

                     uplinked to Skynet.
          
          Morrison puts a hand on her arm.

          His CRY ECHOES through the silo. The CHILDREN cower behind

          BARNES hefts the RPG, looks toward MORRISON-- "should I?"
          Morrison seems torn, about to give the order--
          
          LISA rushes in from the communications area, breathless,

          while MORRISON finishes PADLOCKING HEAVY CHAINS to the BOLTS
          in Marcus' arms and legs-- these attach to a nearby STEEL
          POST. BLAIR stands nearby. LISA fumbles nervously with the
          TRANSMITTER, plugging in wires.

                       When the war began, no one even
                       knew who the enemy was-- Connor
                       taught us how to fight back. He
                       saved humanity.

                       Yeah, well, humanity's never done
                       all that much for me. Why can't I

                                 MORRISON
                       Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be
                       allowed to discover his location,
                       even his appearance is kept secret.
          
          LISA makes a connection, we hear CONNOR'S VOICE, the same one
          we heard on the car radio.

          JOHN CONNOR leans INTO FRAME, studies the screen. He wears a
          dark sweater, nothing like a uniform. Connor is 40ish now,
          but looks older, prematurely grey, years of war have taken a
          toll. There's an ever-present sadness in his eyes.

                       I'm doing here, I don't know shit--
                       maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it!
                       Just blow my head off or let me go.

                       having a conversation with a
                       terminator, Skynet isn't that
                       sophisticated yet. Unless... were
                       you sent here from the future?

                       Skynet's developing a time
                       displacement field, we've decrypted
                       recent data transmissions.

                       I know for a fact that soon machines
                       will be travelling back decades. To
                       try and stop us from winning this war

          visibly PREGNANT. She's poring over FAXES of the X-RAY

          casual dress, at most pins or patches to indicate rank.)

                     Maybe he's a one-off, an experiment.
          
                               ADVISOR #2
                     Let's hope. If there are more out there

                     East-central Texas, near an area of
                     heavy Skynet concentration. The
                     outpost where they're holding him is
                     reasonably secure, but it's not much
                     more than a commune.

          CONNOR picks up the FAXES, disturbed by them.

          THE ADVISORS nod, pick up their papers and exit. As soon as
          they're gone, Connor sits wearily in a chair, tosses the X-
          rays and papers onto the table, his authoritative mask
          slipping. Kate touches his arm. He leans his head against
          her pregnant belly.

                       No. Because I knew I would be, I
                       was told. I know when and where the
                       major battles are going to take
                       place. I know I'm going to send my

                       my mother-- even though I haven't
                       met him yet. Christ, I even know
                       the year I'm going to die...

                       So how could I not know about this?!
          
          He BANGS HIS FIST on the table atop the PAPERS.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR & LAUNCH TUBE - DAY
          
          MARCUS is marched down the corridor to the launch tube,
          Frankenstein-like, MORRISON holding the chains, keeping a
          safe distance from him, while BARNES keeps the RPG trained at
          Marcus' head.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Marcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles.
          It's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Feels like I been here before...
                       what are you gonna do to me?
          
                                 MORRISON
                       Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a
                       chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.
          
          They reach the edge of the SILO PIT-- a long drop, smooth
          walls, a long METAL LADDER leading down into darkness.
          MARCUS pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms
          questioningly-- "now what?"
          
          At a look from Morrison, he and Barnes BODY-CHECK MARCUS at
          once, sending him flying over the edge--
          
          MARCUS FALLS the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete
          FLOOR of the launch tube with a sickening THUD, the CHAINS
          clattering down around him.
          
          MARCUS is stunned, barely conscious as the LADDER is PULLED
          UPWARD. It's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in
          diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor BLACKENED from a
          rocket blast.
          
          ANGLE UP - his captors look down at him for a moment, then
          move out of view.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          
          INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT
          
          CAMERA MOVES past the PRISONERS, a couple dozen total... An
          HISPANIC COUPLE huddle against one wall, whispering to each
          other IN SPANISH... COW rocks in despair, head in her hands,
          BULL and PIG mutter to each other nearby... an OLDER WOMAN
          prays, going through rosary beads... FIND STAR and KYLE.
          She's watching as KYLE uses his pocket knife to CARVE an
          image in the wall of the transport. He looks up.
          
                                 KYLE
                       We're stopping.
          
          
          
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          The BACK PANEL rolls upward. CONTROL ROBOTS-- reminiscent of
          the treaded T-1s but without the heavy weaponry-- flank a
          path from the rear of the transport towards BRIGHT LIGHT up a
          RAMP a short distance away.
          
          THE PRISONERS instinctively move away from the robots, moving
          to the front of the container... until ZZZAP! BLUE ENERGY
          crackles across the floor. THE PRISONERS CRY OUT in pain at
          the electrified surface, and dash toward the opening at the
          rear, leaping out of the container.
          
          LOW ANGLE, as the prisoners run by, we hold a moment on
          Kyle's graffiti-- it's the STICK FIGURE IMAGES of KYLE and
          STAR we saw before, they both hold hands with a LARGER STICK
          FIGURE who stands between them, meant to be MARCUS.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          THE CONTAINER has stopped in a large subterranean space.
          There are numerous FUTURISTIC VEHICLES here-- hydrogen CARS,
          three-wheeled ATVs, electric BUSES. CONTROL `BOTS closest to
          the container start to close in on the huddling PRISONERS.
          
          A ROBOT BUMPS into BULL, sending another JOLT OF ELECTRICITY
          through his body, like a cattle prod. Everyone gets the
          picture, starts hurrying down the line, the ROBOTS closing
          around them.
          
          COW looks around nervously, clearly freaking out.   Spotting a
          gap between the robots, she bolts--
          
          --a ROBOT SWIVELS and CUTS HER DOWN with an ENERGY BLAST.
          She lies still, SMOKE rising from her body.
          
          The other PRISONERS pick up the pace.
          
                                 STAR
                       I'm scared.
          
                                 KYLE
                           (hugging her)
                       Whatever happens, we stick together.
          
          The LIGHT emanates from FROSTED WINDOWS at the top of the
          RAMP, through which we make out the SILHOUETTES of human
          figures.

          CONTINUED:
          
          GLASS DOORS part ahead of the prisoners-- a stark white,
          sterile environment beyond. THE ROBOTS stop here. THE
          PRISONERS disappear inside... and the DOORS CLOSE.

          BARNES remains on guard duty with the RPG, propped up on some
          cushions, a LANTERN by his side-- it's pretty late, the
          generator's shut down. He's reading an old, yellowed COMIC
          BOOK, he has a small stack at his side.
          
          MARCUS' VOICE echoes up from below, startling him.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       Hello? Anyone there?
                           (BEAT)
                       I'm thirsty.
          
                                 BARNES
                           (SNICKERING)
                       Want some motor oil?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I need water.
          
                                   BARNES
                       Bullshit.    Machines don't drink.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Please, I'm--
          
                                 BARNES
                       Shut up, robot!
          
          BARNES returns to his reading. He reacts to FOOTSTEPS from
          the long corridor into the living area behind him.
          
          BLAIR approaches with a FLASHLIGHT, her manner conciliatory.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       How's it going, Barnes? Thought
                       you might like a late-night snack.
          
          She pulls a crumpled plastic PACKAGE out of a pocket of her
          flight suit-- ancient Hostess snack cakes. BARNES' eyes
          light up as he puts the RPG aside and grabs it.

                                 BLAIR
                       We got a stash back at the base.
          
          BARNES tears open the package hungrily, takes a bite.       He
          grins, but as he chews, his expression darkens.
          
                                 BARNES
                       Kinda stale.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You need something to wash it down.
          
          From another pocket, she produces a plastic water bottle
          filled with a murky gray liquid.
          
                                 BARNES
                       I'm on duty, you know.
          
          So saying, he takes the bottle, unscrews the cap and takes a
          long pull. It's powerful hootch, he gasps for air, passes
          her the bottle as she sits beside him. She doesn't drink.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       Twinkies and moonshine. You trying
                       to seduce me again?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You know I always liked you, Barnes.   I
                       just didn't want to join the harem.
          
                                 BARNES
                       What can I say? It's our duty to
                       repopulate the planet.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Noble of you to make the sacrifice.
          
                                 BARNES
                       C'mere.
          
          He pulls her close to him for a kiss. After a moment, she
          pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance. There's a
          large SLIDING STEEL DOOR here.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       I prefer a little privacy.
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

          With some effort, she pulls the door CLOSED. BARNES rises
          with a grin, undoing his shirt, coming close to her. He's
          already unsteady on his feet.
          
                              BARNES
                    You're so twentieth century...
          
          He puts his arms around her for a full body embrace--
          
                              BARNES (cont'd)
                    Admit it, I'm the best you ever had...
          
          His words are slurring. He slides to the floor, slowly
          losing his grip. He rolls onto his back with a drugged-out
          expression of bliss on his unconscious face.
          
                               BLAIR
                    Men.   You're all talk.
          
          IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
          
          MARCUS leans against the wall in the dark, rolls out of the
          way as the LADDER drops. BLAIR descends quickly, the
          FLASHLIGHT in her belt, a battery BLADE SAW in one hand. She
          sets the flashlight on the ground and moves to his side--
          
                              BLAIR (cont'd)
                    I used up the last of my Valium for
                    you... Hold out your arms.
          
          He does, she fires up the SAW, moves it carefully to the bolt
          joining his forearms. SPARKS fly from the BUZZING BLADE as
          it digs into the metal-- it's going to take some time.
          
                              MARCUS
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              BLAIR
                    I don't believe you're a terminator.
          
                              MARCUS
                    So what am I...?
          
                              BLAIR
                    Whatever you are-- I owe you one.
                    Once you're free, I'll lie down
                    next to Barnes-- they'll assume you
                    escaped while we were passed out--

                               BLAIR
                     Worth a shot.
                         (looking at him)
                     Marcus, Command wants to take you
                     apart, cut open your head. One
                     thing I know, you're alive-- and
                     you've got a right to live.
          
          THE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to:
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          THE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low
          growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles,
          coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged
          beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED
          CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS.
          
          THE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the
          LAUNCH TUBE.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
          
          THE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his
          arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they
          hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead.
          
                               BLAIR
                     They're already here for you--
          
          MARCUS slides the BOLTS out of his legs, freeing himself from
          the chains.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Hide in the forest, then aim west
                     for open country--
          
                               MARCUS
                     I'm heading across the river.
          
                               BLAIR
                     No human being can survive there--
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm not human, remember?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You're gonna try and save those kids.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       It's the only thing I can think of
                       that makes any sense...
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Marcus, for all you know, they're
                       dead already--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       For all I know, they're the reason
                       I'm back from the dead.
          
          BLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she
          admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following.
          
          BARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the
          platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door--
          
          BLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES
          and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Damn it, we're too late--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Where's that go?
          
          MARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL
          GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit.
          It's not running, but there's no way to get through it.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Should lead out, but there's no way
                       past the fan--
          
          MARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it
          backwards, has no idea how to shoot it--
          
          BLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself,
          takes aim and FIRES--
          
          KABOOM!   The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN.
          
                                                                            65.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          MORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed
          with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to
          the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run,
          the soldiers readying their weapons.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the
          far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks
          of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the
          size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus.
          
                               BLAIR
                     Here. My ELT-- emergency locator
                     transmitter. If you find the camp,
                     activate it like this. It could
                     really help the Resistance.
          
          She indicates a button.     MARCUS takes the device--
          
          --then grabs her, KISSES HER hard on the mouth-- she's
          startled-- it felt very human.
          
                                  MARCUS
                     Thank you.
          
          MARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from
          the hole and pulls himself upward as--
          
          THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS--
          
          BLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the
          CONCRETE--
          
          --SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the
          ventilation shaft--
          
          
          INT.   VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS has a CHUNK OF REBAR lodged in his left SHOULDER, but
          he doesn't even notice this yet. He picks himself up and
          moves quickly in the darkness, crouching in this cramped
          tube. There's a TURN up ahead, he just makes it as--
          
          An EXPLOSIVE SHELL rockets through the shaft behind him--
                                                                  (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          66.
          CONTINUED:
          
          BOOM! THE BLAST TEARS through the metal tube, DIRT POURS IN,
          blocking the tunnel from his pursuers.
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          Near the edge of the clearing, a low STEEL VENT with a peaked
          CAP. DENTS appear in it from within--
          
          MARCUS finally PUNCHES his way out, pulls himself up and
          rolls onto the dirt-- for a moment he seems safe, laying low
          in the grass. Then--
          
          --he registers the REBAR in his shoulder. It goes right
          through him, emerging from his chest. Marcus is stunned.
          With some effort, he YANKS OUT the REBAR and tosses it aside.
          TORN METAL of his steel endoskeleton is now exposed, along
          with a glimpse of circuitry. Marcus reels, puts a hand over
          the hole in his chest where a heart should be; he really
          isn't human. He doesn't have much time to deal with this as--
          
          --THE CHOPPER emerges from behind the treeline, the SPOTLIGHT
          picks him out and AUTOMATIC FIRE erupts--
          
          MARCUS runs a few yards and throws himself to the ground as--
          
          GUNFIRE STRAFES around and ahead of him-- setting off several
          MINES which send up clouds of dirt.
          
          MARCUS picks himself up and runs for the trees, leaping over
          the barbed wire.
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST - NIGHT
          
          MORE GUNFIRE rips apart the trees around Marcus as he sprints
          and weaves, making his way toward the river. The SPOTLIGHT
          picks him up and loses him again-- it's tough for the chopper
          to get a clear shot at him here.
          
          
          EXT.   RIVERBANK - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS has reached the edge of the trees, he can see the
          river just beyond. He starts to move for it, when--
          
          --FWOOM! The forest around him ERUPTS INTO FLAME, the
          chopper has laid NAPALM along the river's edge.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          67.
          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS reels from the intense heat, bats out FLAMES on his
          clothes, but his skin remains undamaged. Realizing he can
          keep on moving--
          
          --MARCUS DASHES through the dense FIRE to--
          
          
          EXT.   RIVER - DAWN
          
          --the RIVER, where the sky is just starting to LIGHTEN.
          MARCUS SPLASHES into the shallows, extinguishing the FLAMES.
          He fills his hands with water and sucks it down gratefully.
          
          ANGLE ON THE WATER - A GLIMMER of METAL below the surface,
          heading for the source of the splashing. Suddenly--
          
          --the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of
          Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER
          pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two
          soldiers we saw before). The BLADE WASH swirls the water in
          a whirlpool and beats back the FIRE behind Marcus. As the
          GUNNER OPENS FIRE--
          
          --MARCUS DIVES below the surface, BULLETS ZINGING through the
          murky water.
          
          UNDERWATER - MARCUS is winged by a couple of shots, his
          thermoplastic flesh getting torn apart--
          
          WITH THE GUNNER - He pauses a moment, squinting into the
          WATER for a glimpse of Marcus, but failing to register that--
          
          --BELOW THE CHOPPER, right beneath him, the WATER ROILS as if
          teeming with piranha. Suddenly--
          
          --HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING
          SOUND. Hydrobots resemble segmented serpents, eyeless, but
          with razor-sharp heads that DRILL into their victims-- they
          respond to sound and vibrations. About a dozen of these four-
          foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to
          attack the chopper.
          
          INSIDE THE CHOPPER - HYDROBOTS PIERCE the aluminum FLOOR, and
          shoot into the cabin, the PILOT and the two SOLDIERS CRY OUT.
          
          The GUNNER tumbles out of the chopper and FALLS in the water.
          
          THE PILOT attempts to maintain control, but the hydraulics
          are damaged and the steel serpents thrash about in the cabin.
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          68.
          CONTINUED:
          
          THE GUNNER surfaces, trying frantically to swim to shore.
          But the hydrobots are upon him, he SHRIEKS and disappears
          beneath the bubbling surface, which now boils with BLOOD.
          
          IN THE CHOPPER - A WHIRRING HYDROBOT penetrates the other
          soldier's leg. He SCREAMS and wrenches the thing back out,
          tossing it from the chopper just before--
          
          --THE CHOPPER CRASHES INTO THE SHALLOWS.
          
          THE PILOT leaps from the cabin and makes it to shore, where
          he collapses. But the remaining, wounded SOLDIER can't get
          out of the hip-deep water before the HYDROBOTS are upon him.
          
          Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.
          A second later, MARCUS SURFACES, slinging the man over his
          shoulder. He strides to shore, as if rescuing the man from
          enemy fire, hydrobots thrashing and bubbling at his waist.
          
          MARCUS reaches the amazed pilot, lays the wounded soldier
          down beside him, then tears a whirring, writhing HYDROBOT
          from the soldier's belly and WHIPS its head against a ROCK--
          it SPARKS, micro-machine parts fly. The pilot and wounded
          soldier stare at him, astonished.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Don't mention it.
          
          He tosses the dead robo-snake aside, then turns and moves
          back into the water, quickly vanishing below the surface.
          
          UNDERWATER - MARCUS moves steadily across the silty river
          bottom. He doesn't need air. HYDROBOTS come at him, he
          swats them away as if they were mosquitoes, CRUSHING in his
          hand those that linger too long. Those which make contact
          with his artificial skin can't get far, turn and swim off.
          
          
          EXT.   FAR RIVERBANK - DAY
          
          MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of
          the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves
          into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded,
          everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a
          mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred.
          
          He nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which
          emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains
          its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing...
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                         69.
          CONTINUED:
          
          TERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED.
          READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS "NON-ORGANIC -
          DO NOT TERMINATE."
          
          THE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested,
          moving off on its preprogrammed patrol.
          
          MARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT.   At the top
          of the rise, he sees, spread out before him--
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY
          
          --a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING
          FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on
          patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape.
          
          After a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers
          on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY
          
          MARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE
          LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING
          DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like
          wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond.
          
          MARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see--
          
          --A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE.   A second later--
          
          ZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a
          few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as--
          
          --a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its
          plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice.
          
          MARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS
          patrolling near the riverside.
          
          
          EXT.   DEMOLITION SITE - DAY
          
          MARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with
          the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS.
          Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as--
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          A WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET
          BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine
          has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant
          TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust.
          
          
          EXT.   CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
          
          MARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives
          way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human
          world in their own image.
          
          CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure,
          automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are
          oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with
          multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of
          legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place
          by telescoping steel arms.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY
          
          MARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's
          ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single-
          story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive
          open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED
          GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred
          lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of
          POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING
          POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc.
          
          MARCUS steps inside one of these buildings--

          This TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled
          clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS.
          
          ELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place.
          STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE
          PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS.
          
          Partially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY
          STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS,
          elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like
          the ones in present-day factories.

          CONTINUED:
          
          SYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in
          precise amounts, building up to create human features... this
          is a T-400.
          
          An INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE
          CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked
          rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts
          this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into
          the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole.
          
          THE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the
          TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes
          a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past--
          
          --the dumbfounded MARCUS.
          
          THE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a
          treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER.
          There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY
          
          Rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees
          all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES
          built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path
          for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him
          they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS...
          
          A convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified
          SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely
          high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL
          BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of
          clearance on either side.
          
          These things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus
          to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast
          as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly.
          
          MARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the
          street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over
          him, the wheels missing him by inches.
          
          But he has only a moment's respite. THE NEXT TRUCK has a
          lower undercarriage, a steel CROSSMEMBER catches his back--
          
          --and DRAGS MARCUS beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of
          flesh.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Marcus CRIES OUT, crawls ahead and clings to a forward
          portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the
          pavement. His LEFT LEG, twisted and damaged, still drags on
          the asphalt, throwing up SPARKS.
          
          OVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE TRUCK - CAMERA PULLS BACK straight
          above the MOVING VEHICLE, amidst the convoy speeding down
          this sunken artery. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING UPWARD to reveal an
          AERIAL VIEW of Skynet's city. Seen from above, the
          rectilinear STRUCTURES, criss-crossing POWER LINES and
          SPEEDING VEHICLES strongly resemble a PULSING CIRCUIT BOARD.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          JOHN CONNOR moves grimly down a narrow, steel passageway,
          FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. He reaches the MP, outside the door.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       I need to talk to the prisoner.
          
          The MP looks a little surprised, but says nothing.    He undoes
          the LATCH on the door and opens it for Connor.
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/INTERROGATION CELL - DAY
          
          A bare, windowless space with only a cot, a metal chair and a
          bedpan. BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared.
          CONNOR gestures for the MP to close the door behind him.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry
                       about the way you've been treated,
                       but we're forced to take every
                       precaution. I'm John Connor.
          
          Blair's mighty impressed, in spite of the circumstances.       She
          leaps to her feet, stands at attention and salutes.
          
                                  BLAIR
                       Sir.
          
                                  CONNOR
                       At ease.   Please, sit.

          CONTINUED:
          
          CONNOR pulls up the chair, close to Blair, who sits on the
          bed. His tone is careful, controlled.
          
                                  CONNOR (cont'd)
                       I've gone over your record,
                       lieutenant. You're a good soldier,
                       flown a lot of missions...
                           (BEAT)
                       Why in God's name would you help a
                       terminator escape?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Sir-- he isn't a terminator.     He's
                       human.
          
                                  CONNOR
                       We know he's crossed into Skynet
                       territory, why would he do that if
                       he isn't--
          
                                 BLAIR
                       He's trying to find his friends.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       What friends?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       A couple of kids. They were taken
                       in a Skynet transport, probably to
                       some kind of prison camp-- he said
                       their names were Star and Kyle.
          
          Connor blinks at this, alert.
          
                                    CONNOR
                       Kyle.
          
          Blair picks up on his interest, but doesn't understand it.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Mm... Kyle something.    With an `R.'
          
                                    CONNOR
                       Reese.
          
                                    BLAIR
                       That's it.     How did you...?

          CONNOR is already on his feet, BANGING on the door-- the MP

          Partway down the hallway, CONNOR encounters KATE, who walks
          with him, takes in his expression.
          
                               KATE

                               CONNOR
                     I always knew I'd have to find him
                     someday. I just didn't know how.
          
                                KATE
                     What?   Find who?
          
                                  CONNOR
                     My father.

          START CLOSE on KYLE'S HAND, clutching STAR'S tightly.   We
          hear them SINGING faintly, together:
          
                               KYLE AND STAR
                     Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
          
          WIDER, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto SLIDING
          TRAYS, a long row of these hold OTHER PRISONERS as well.
          Kyle and Star must reach across a gap between the trays to
          hold hands. (It's the first time we've seen her hatless.)
          
          The trays are all poised before panel-covered SEMI-CIRCULAR
          OPENINGS built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital-like
          environment. Above each opening is a MONITOR SCREEN. An
          ominous HUM is building.
          
          IN AN ADJACENT OPERATING THEATER, visible through GLASS
          WALLS, MEDICAL LASERS mounted on ROBOTIC ARMS work on
          anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details).
          
          BEHIND STAR and KYLE, the PANELS OPEN, the trays slowly SLIDE
          into the OPENINGS. SCREAMS and SOBS from other prisoners.

                       Shh, keep singing.
          
          Kyle and Star hold hands for as long as possible, then
          release their grip as their bodies enter the chambers and the
          panels slide shut.

          closes her eyes as she's bathed in BRIGHT LIGHT, LASER GRIDS
          projecting over her skull. The HUMMING is LOUDER.

          chassis, near a WHEEL, moving slowly, carefully. There's a
          bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now,
          but they're still moving awfully fast.
          
          THE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a
          turn, braking downhill. Marcus seizes this opportunity.
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE as MARCUS LAUNCHES himself from below the
          vehicle, rolling into the GAP between the convoy and the
          concrete wall. The remaining vehicles RUMBLE PAST, as MARCUS
          presses himself against the wall.

          When they're gone, he gets to his feet, limping down the
          highway on foot for a short distance, dragging his damaged
          leg behind him. He hears ANOTHER CONVOY approaching.
          
          Just in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's
          enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the
          eight feet of freeway wall.
          
          MARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below.
          This is desolate, hilly country.
          
          ANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like
          the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished
          FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within.
          
          MARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks
          for a short distance until--
          
          THE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight.      In
          the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the
          destination.
          
          Marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading
          for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks
          down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he
          expected to see. CAMERA MOVES to reveal--

          place is lush, green, with well-maintained, lovely HOMES in
          the distance, a BLUE SEA beyond. The complex of buildings
          stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley.
          
          MARCUS, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this
          seeming paradise.

          MARCUS emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself
          looking at a groomed FAIRWAY. Marcus hears a NOISE nearby--
          
          --a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.    MARCUS
          turns in the direction it came from.

          Marcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the
          cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal
          at his shoulder and leg.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       What the hell is this?
          
                                 JEREMY
                       You look like you've been hit by a truck--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Among other things. Look, I'm
                       trying to find some friends-- a
                       couple of kids. They were taken
                       here, I saw some buildings--
          
          JEREMY eyes him, a little surprised at his ignorance.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       The facility, sure.   Hop in, I'll
                       take you there.
          
          Marcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy? But Jeremy
          simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger
          seat, then gets behind the wheel. With a smile:
          
                                 JEREMY (cont'd)
                       This round was gonna blow my
                       handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy.
          
          He extends a hand.     After a beat, Marcus reaches toward it--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Marcus.
          
          Jeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly.     Marcus blinks, Jeremy
          cocks his head, then lets go.

                               JEREMY
                     I can't connect with you at all...
                     your interface must've been
                     damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll
                     have you as good as new.
          
          With that, he hits the gas.
          
          
          EXT.   RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING
          
          JEREMY drives the cart down the road, past well-kept homes
          with generous lawns-- it's a beautiful, upscale community at
          MAGIC HOUR. BICYCLISTS and FUTURISTIC CARS pass, Jeremy
          waves to NEIGHBORS. Marcus takes it all in with disbelief.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I didn't think there was-- anything
                     like this left... anywhere.
          
                                JEREMY
                     Yes.   We're very lucky.   Want some?
          
          He holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes
          a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth. After a beat,
          he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it.
          
                               MARCUS
                     This isn't food.
          
                               JEREMY
                     Well, of course not. Seems you got
                     a little memory loss going on.
          
          Marcus stares at him, confused. Jeremy is starting to
          realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child.
          
                                JEREMY (cont'd)
                     It's a foam resin. It can taste like
                     anything you want it to-- but of
                     course, we don't really need to eat.
                         (BEAT)
                     Our brains are powered by fuel cells,
                     remember?
          
          Marcus just stares, Jeremy gestures at the world around them.
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                       We're in a transitional phase.
                       Most of us need the comfort of the
                       familiar a little while longer--
                       food, shelter, sex. Until we
                       forget the old life.
          
          As he speaks, he notices his BAG is nearly empty. He
          casually lifts his sport shirt and CLICKS OPEN a PANEL
          beneath his rib cage. We glimpse CIRCUITS, FIBER-OPTICS.
          
                                 JEREMY (cont'd)
                       Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of
                       the hardest habits to break... but
                       before long, none of this will be
                       necessary. We won't even need these
                       bodies.
          
          From within he removes an identical BAG FILLED with TRAIL MIX
          (the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag.
          He clicks the panel shut again, pops a NUT in his mouth.
          
          Marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away.
          He reacts to the sound of PIANO MUSIC, a difficult piece
          being played expertly-- PASSING a PICTURE WINDOW, he sees a
          PIANIST practicing.
          
          In front of this home, a GARDENER and WINDOW WASHER are hard
          at work. They're both T-400s, with the eerie mask-like
          faces. Marcus reacts.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Terminators!
          
          Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to
          regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if
          he'd picked up some homeless guy.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       We don't call them that here.
          
          Marcus grabs Jeremy, who pulls back a bit, alarmed.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       What are you?
          
                                   JEREMY
                       A hybrid.    The same as you.

                     A hybrid-- human and machine?
          
                               JEREMY
                     Of course. That's what this community
                     is for-- people like us.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Jesus... why?
          
                               JEREMY
                     You should be grateful to have been
                     chosen.
          
                               MARCUS
                     What about the ones who weren't?
          
                               JEREMY
                     You mean like Janet and the kids.
          
          For a moment, Jeremy's expression darkens.     Then he shuts his
          eyes, and his features relax.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Your family. You lost them?
          
          Jeremy nods and SMILES, looking at him once more.
          
                               MARCUS (cont'd)
                     Why are you smiling?
          
                               JEREMY
                     `Cause I feel good. The interface
                     recognizes negative emotions-- rage,
                     grief, despair-- and stimulates
                     positive endorphins in response. Thank
                     God, life would be pretty unbearable
                     otherwise, don't you think?
          
          
          EXT.   PARK - DUSK
          
          They've left the main street now, driving down a WOODED PATH
          leading to the "facility." There are lawns, fountains, etc.
          Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the
          throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened.

                       people get here?
          
                                 JEREMY
                       Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA.
                       I was an engineer on Project Angel--
          
          Marcus drags the man from the cart by his throat, squeezing
          harder.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Angel-- what is it?
          
                                 JEREMY
                       Advanced Nexus of Genetic and
                       Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L.
                       You can stop choking me, it's not
                       like I need to breathe.
          
          Marcus releases him, but remains in his face.       Jeremy takes a
          moment to recover his composure.
          
                                 JEREMY (cont'd)
                       We replaced the body's hydrocarbons
                       with plastinated compounds while
                       maintaining cellular structure--
                       analog neural impulses were converted
                       to wireless digital signals,
                       controlling the micro-tech chassis--

                           (sighs, slowly)
                       The goal was a superior support
                       system for the human brain-- to go
                       anywhere, do anything-- explore
                       deep space, the bottom of the sea.
                       I specialized in optics.
          
          He taps his own eye with an audible CLICK, not flinching.
          Marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands.
          
          Jeremy points to nearby BUILDINGS, a little peevish.

                     The facility is just ahead. I'll
                     let them know you're coming.
          
          So saying, he's back in the cart, pulling away in a hurry.   A
          moment later, Marcus moves off amongst the trees.
          
          Nearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above.   He
          looks up, stops as he sees--
          
          --a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES.
          
          MARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels
          unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made
          of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC.
          
          He crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a
          SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's
          ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT.
          
          Marcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt--
          and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we
          see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc.
          
          By now he's rolled back a few square yards, numb with horror.
          Marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination,
          trying to stay out of sight.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT.   LABORATORY - NIGHT
          
          ON THE MONITORS above the long row of chambers-- colorful 3-D
          IMAGES of the prisoner's BRAINS are being constructed, like
          PET scans. DENSE DIGITAL READ-OUTS BELOW, as data is
          analyzed. (Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside
          these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the
          chamber, the subjects looking frightened.
          
          IN THE OPERATING THEATER, the LASERS are still now, their
          grisly work done for the moment, awaiting the next batch.
          
          An ENGINEER, a nice-looking, well-built young man in loose
          black clothing, moves down the row of chambers, studying
          results. He speaks into a subtle HEAD-SET:

                       even been brought here...
          
          As he speaks, the BARCODES on the monitors in question turn
          either RED or GREEN in response to his judgments.
          
          He reaches KYLE'S CHAMBER, we see Kyle's anguished FACE on
          the monitor photograph.

                       32581 looks good...
          
          Kyle gets a GREEN BARCODE, the engineer is on to Star, he
          strokes his chin.

                       be emotionally compatible. Pass.
          
          On STAR'S MONITOR-- RED BARCODE.
          
          The engineer KICKS something on the floor, bends down to pick
          it up-- STAR'S BASEBALL CAP. He flings it expertly into--
          
          --a nearby TRASH RECEPTACLE.

          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          A series of LOW-RISE BUILDINGS, attractively LIT, surrounded
          by lawn, trees and water features. A HUMAN TRANSPORT heads
          down a RAMP into a parking structure; a GATE closes.
          
          FIND MARCUS, watching this from behind some plastic foliage.
          He sets his jaw, removes something from his pocket, fiddles
          with it and places it carefully in the bushes. He moves on.
          
          Nearing an entrance, he hears a familiar voice from nearby.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Marcus!

          CONTINUED:
          
          A BACKLIT FIGURE approaches-- as her face enters the light,
          we see that it's SERENA, looking healthy, beautiful. Marcus
          stares at her coldly.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       Marcus... it is you. You're alive,
                       you found us. Welcome to paradise.
          
                                 MARCUS
                           (DISGUSTED)
                       It's a graveyard.
          
          SERENA takes in his anger, adopts a regretful tone.
          
                                 SERENA
                       There was no choice-- the old
                       civilization had to be eliminated.
                       To make way for a new world... a
                       world without death or suffering.
          
          SERENA puts her arms around him. He doesn't return the
          embrace, but he doesn't resist her.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       You were the first... I'm sorry.
          
          So saying, she presses a small, taser-like device at the base
          of his skull-- ZAP! MARCUS SPASMS and goes limp in her arms.
          SERENA lets him down gently on the ground.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       We should never have left you behind.
          
          A pair of T-400s now approach from the shadows. They pick up
          Marcus and carry him toward the building. CAMERA MOVES to
          find, hidden in the bushes where Marcus placed it--
          
          --the ELT, the EMERGENCY BEACON Blaire gave him... activated
          now, a single GREEN LIGHT PULSES.

          CONNOR and KATE, hastily dressed, cross through the command
          center we've seen before, and step through a HATCHWAY into--

          --a MASSIVE CONTROL AREA for a HUGE SUBMARINE. SONAR and

          THE AIDE leads CONNOR to a GPS TRACKING TERMINAL, where NAVAL
          and AIR FORCE OFFICERS hover.

                       The signal's coming from near what used

                       There can't be any prisoners there.
                       The whole area's a nuclear
                       wasteland-- only machines can
                       survive the radiation levels for

          The OFFICERS raise AD LIB objections ("but sir--"). CONNOR
          raises a hand to silence them and moves a few steps away,
          beside KATE. They speak in hushed tones:

          We see now that Connor's on board a NUCLEAR ATTACK SUB, with
          TWO MORE SUBS moving in tandem behind it.
          
          HOLD ON the LEAD SUB and MOVE IN ON the STENCILLED NAME as it

          START ON MARCUS' DAMAGED LEG. It has been DETACHED from his
          body, halfway down the thigh. Elaborate CIRCUITS are
          exposed, as SURGICAL MACHINES perform repairs with LASERS,
          MECHANICAL ARMS replacing damaged parts.
          
          NEARBY, MARCUS opens his eyes, coming to. He's CLAMPED onto
          an elaborate, mobile SURGICAL TABLE, the stump exposed. His
          body and head are secured within its framework. MORE
          MACHINES swiftly repair the damage to his chest and shoulder.
          
          MARCUS twitches, freaking out, struggling in his bonds--
          
          THE DETACHED LEG twitches as well.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Calm down, Marcus.   It's all right.
          
          SERENA is on the other side of a GLASS PANEL, operating
          computer controls. This is an automated surgical
          environment, the work on Marcus carried out by various
          MACHINES and MICROTOOLS-- busy HYDRAULIC ARMS, LASERS, etc.

                       Listen to me. Skynet was designed to
                       detect threats, make projections and
                       implement solutions. As soon as it
                       came on line, it factored in war,
                       disease, environmental destruction--
                       and calculated a high probability of
                       total human extinction within two
                       hundred years. The human race was
                       doomed... unless we were transformed.
          
          THE SURGICAL TABLE swivels, bringing MARCUS into alignment
          with the repaired leg. In moments it's reattached, the
          plastic skin thermosealed at the joint.
          
                                 MARCUS

          THE LASER TOOLS and HYDRAULIC ARMS now move on their ceiling

          She clasps his hand in both of hers. MARCUS closes his eyes,
          a jolt of pleasure shooting through him.

          SERENA releases Marcus' hands. He opens his eyes slowly,
          reeling from the intense moment. CAMERA REVEALS a subtle
          BULGE at the base of his skull, the implanted interface.

                       When I was a kid my grandmother
                       would go on about heaven... it
                       always sounded so boring.

          blue ball right now, dwarfed by the MACHINERY which sustains
          it. The sphere is set into a dome-shaped depression in the

                       She didn't suffer.
          
          Marcus takes this in, his face shows pain. Then SERENA
          grasps his hand-- in moments, he's smiling.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       Of course.     I... I understand.
          
          Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant
          EXPLOSION. SERENA releases MARCUS, listens in her earpiece.

                       you be all right?
                           (off his smile and nod)
                       Of course you will.
          
          She touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone
          here. We'll hear other far off EXPLOSIONS from time to time
          during the following. MARCUS stares at--
          
          HIS FRIENDS' FACES, which slowly FADE TO BLACK, replaced by
          his own REFLECTION. Seeing his own face, his smile vanishes.
          
          MARCUS is going through a terrible internal struggle, the
          interface fighting his own natural emotions. He backs away
          from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives
          destroyed.
          
          Hurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base
          of his skull... with an ANGRY CRY--

          MARCUS hurls the DEVICE to the floor, its elaborate CIRCUITRY
          SHATTERS. He reels with momentary anguish at what he's just

          MARCUS moves purposefully across the campus-- suddenly
          HEADLIGHTS illuminate him. He dives out of the way as--
          
          A FUTURISTIC ATV roars past at high speed.   It's followed

          DRIPPING down around him.
          
          MARCUS tries to get his bearings-- he's in the park area, the
          FACILITY not too far off. He moves in that direction.
          
                                                                          96.
          
          
          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          THE GATE to the garage OPENS, an empty HUMAN TRANSPORT
          emerges... FIND MARCUS, concealed, still unclothed. He dives
          under the GATE as it rolls shut.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS moves stealthily through the space where the prisoners
          were off-loaded, keeping out of sight behind parked vehicles.
          He starts at the sight of--
          
          THE CONTROL ROBOTS, hooked to CHARGING POSTS along one wall.
          
          MARCUS makes his way to the GLASS DOORS.   Using all his
          strength, he manages to PRY THEM OPEN.
          
          
          INT.   LABORATORY - NIGHT
          
          The ENGINEER as we saw him before, consulting the MONITORS
          above the CHAMBERS.
          
                               ENGINEER
                     32581 looks good... 32582... hm,
                     borderline. May not be emotionally
                     compatible. Pass.
          
          The engineer picks up STAR'S BASEBALL CAP and flings it into
          the TRASH...
          
          Just then he hears SHATTERING GLASS behind him.   He spins--
          
          MARCUS trains a ripped-off ROBOTIC LASER ARM at him like a
          weapon. The arm trails heavy CABLES and CIRCUITS, linking it
          to the operating theater we saw earlier. (These also
          artfully conceal Marcus' nakedness.)
          
                               MARCUS
                     Let them go.
          
                                ENGINEER
                     What?   Who are you?
          
          MARCUS takes a step closer.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I said, let them go!
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          97.
          CONTINUED:
          
          THE ENGINEER moves to a RED ALARM BUTTON on a COMMUNICATION
          PANEL mounted in the wall, extending a hand--
          
          MARCUS connects two wires to FIRE UP the LASER and--
          
          A RED BEAM neatly SEVERS the ENGINEER'S HAND at his WRIST.
          
          THE ENGINEER studies the metal STUMP of his severed hand with
          a blank expression.
          
                                 ENGINEER
                       You can't hurt me.
          
          The ENGINEER smirks and WHACKS the ALARM BUTTON with his
          other hand. An ELECTRONIC KLAXON sounds.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Now you're pissing me off.
          
          MARCUS FIRES OFF THE LASER again--
          
          --THE ENGINEER stares at him-- we see a flaming STRIP in the
          wall behind his head. He takes a step toward Marcus and--
          
          --his HEAD TUMBLES OFF, bounces on the ground, and rolls to
          MARCUS' FEET. (There's no blood, just laser-severed
          electronic connections).
          
          MARCUS picks up the ENGINEER'S HEAD by the hair.   The man's
          brain is unharmed.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       How'd that feel?
          
          THE MAN'S MOUTH twists and grimaces, making ELECTRONIC STATIC
          from the FRIED VOICEBOX. MARCUS is taken by surprise when--
          
          --THE DECAPITATED BODY lunges at him, knocks the LASER from
          his grasp. After a brief STRUGGLE, MARCUS spins the
          engineer's HEAD to face his body. He grabs the INTERFACE at
          the base of his neck.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       I pull this off and you'll be in a
                       world of pain!
          
          THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                    Last chance. Let them out.
          
          AT A CONTROL TERMINAL, the one-handed, headless BODY taps
          keys and controls. MARCUS holds the Engineer's HEAD so that
          he can see over his own shoulder. Moments later--
          
          --the MACHINE HUM winds down. THE MONITORS flash the word
          "ABORT," the PANELS begin to OPEN.
          
          MARCUS addresses the HEAD in his hand.
          
                              MARCUS (cont'd)
                    I'm gonna need your clothes.
          
          THE HEADLESS BODY begins to unbutton its shirt.
          
          MOMENTS LATER - CLOSE as KYLE'S TRAY slides out of his
          CHAMBER. The RESTRAINTS retract automatically. He sits up,
          looking toward--
          
          --STAR, on the next tray.   She hasn't moved, her eyes closed.
          
                              KYLE
                    No!
          
          He climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms.    She starts
          awake.
          
                              STAR
                    What?
          
          Around them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their
          feet, surprised at their sudden freedom.
          
          MARCUS approaches KYLE, buttoning his new shirt.
          
                              KYLE
                    Marcus!
          
          The two kids hurry to him, Marcus hands Star her BASEBALL
          CAP, rescued from the trash. As she puts it on:
          
                              STAR
                    I knew you'd come.
          
          THE PRISONERS are already on the move, frantically dashing
          out of the lab ahead of our heros.

                               MARCUS
                     We've gotta get out of here.
          
          He leads the kids out the way he came, passing...
          
          THE ENGINEER, in underwear, sitting in a corner, cradling his
          head in his lap. His remaining hand strokes his interface,
          his eyes closed in a blissful expression.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          THE PRISONERS smash the GLASS DOORS off their hinges, and
          charge past--
          
          THE CONTROL ROBOTS, which are now coming to life. ELECTRIC
          BURSTS drop a couple of slow-moving ESCAPEES as they dash
          into the garage and make for--
          
          --ANY AVAILABLE VEHICLE. Former PRISONERS hijack BUSES,
          HYDROGEN CARS. Pure chaos, it feels like a prison riot.
          
          MARCUS, STAR and KYLE weave amidst the robots and humans.
          
                                  MARCUS
                     Stay down!
          
          KYLE and STAR take cover behind a concrete post just as--
          
          --PLASMA BURSTS explode around them.
          
          SKELETAL TERMINATORS armed with PLASMA RIFLES are pouring in
          through the OPENING GARAGE GATE.
          
          A STOLEN BUS heads for the exit, KNOCKING a couple of
          TERMINATORS aside and SMASHING through the rising GATE,
          clearing a path for others to follow.
          
          A SKELETAL TERMINATOR sets its sights on a MOVING HYDROGEN
          CAR, which follows the bus--
          
          TERMINATOR POV - RED FILTER, HIGHLIGHTING BULL, the DRIVER.
          "TARGET ACQUIRED - TERMINATE."
          
          THE TERMINATOR SHOOTS HIS RIFLE through the car's windshield--
          it EXPLODES, close to KYLE and STAR, the building SHAKES.
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          KYLE and STAR flee the flames, THE TERMINATOR'S HEAD swivels
          quickly, taking them in. It starts to pursue, but MARCUS
          gets in front of it. Before it can fire--
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       It's OK, I'm not human!
          
          The Terminator pauses, looks him over.
          
          TERMINATOR POV - MARCUS is quickly scanned, comes up "NON-
          ORGANIC - DO NOT TERMINATE."
          
          THE   TERMINATOR starts to move past Marcus, who LEAPS on it
          and   WRENCHES THE RIFLE from its grasp. As the robot spins on
          him   he BLOWS ITS HEAD OFF, then looks around frantically for
          the   kids. A moment later--
          
          --KYLE ROARS up at the controls of a futuristic ATV, STAR
          clinging to him.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       You can't drive!
          
                                   KYLE
                       Watch me!
          
          No time to argue, MARCUS leaps into the back beside STAR and
          KYLE GUNS IT out of there, careening off walls and other
          vehicles, he's still not much of a driver. MARCUS meanwhile
          PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.
          
          
          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          KYLE has to swerve to avoid the stolen BUS, which is now on
          its side, IN FLAMES. It was taken out by--
          
          --an automated SKYNET TANK, one of THREE TANKS here. They're
          positioned to take out escaping vehicles. But the ATV is a
          small, maneuverable target, swerving and speeding crazily. A
          TANK FIRES and MISSES, the BLAST taking out a chunk of wall.
          
          KYLE WHOOPS, heading across the campus--
          
          --ONE TANK pursues, it moves surprisingly fast, capable of
          flattening anything in its path. MARCUS FIRES at it, but the
          PLASMA RIFLE BLASTS don't have much effect on the ARMOR.
          
          THE TANK FIRES again, but--
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          --KYLE ROARS around a corner, just in time.   However, in so
          doing, he nearly runs over--
          
          --MARCUS, from earlier, on his way to the time sphere,
          visible in the HEADLIGHTS for only an instant before he LEAPS
          OUT OF THE WAY.
          
          KYLE, focused on the pursuing tank, didn't even see this.
          But STAR did. She looks wide-eyed at MARCUS beside her.
          
                                 STAR
                       That looked like--
          
                                  MARCUS
                       I know.   Long story.
          
          PLAY THE CHASE, as the TANK pursues the ATV through the
          facility.
          
          KYLE takes his vehicle through a large FOUNTAIN, which the
          TANK SMASHES to bits.
          
          KYLE OVERSTEERS, putting them up on two wheels, then
          recovers, narrowly avoiding--
          
          --PLASMA BLASTS, which obliterate the FACADE of a building.
          
          SKELETAL TERMINATORS appear in their HEADLIGHTS, weapons
          raised.
          
          MARCUS stands and FIRES over KYLE'S HEAD, BLOWING them out of
          the way.
          
          NEAR THE PARK, MARCUS points.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Take that path!
          
          
          EXT.   PARK/WOODS - NIGHT
          
          THE TANK is gaining on them, KYLE steers around a GAZEBO, the
          tank SMASHES right through it, turning it to splinters.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       The trees!

          CONTINUED:
          
          Kyle steers toward THE WOODS, dodging between the thick
          TREES. Too many obstacles for the TANK here, it SCREECHES TO
          A HALT and lets off a JET OF FLAME.
          
          THE TREES behind the ATV all IGNITE, turning to acrid pools
          of MELTING PLASTIC. KYLE barely stays ahead of the FIRE.
          
          THE TANK backs up and takes a new route, around the woods.
          
          IN THE WOODS, KYLE strikes a GLANCING BLOW against a tree
          trunk, and the ATV TOPPLES on its side, spilling its
          passengers. After a beat, they rise, shaken.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       You two all right?

          THE ATV comes rocketing down the main street, MARCUS driving
          now. Suddenly, directly in front of them--
          
          --THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN
          TURRET SWIVELING at them.
          
          AS IT FIRES, MARCUS SWERVES onto a LAWN and--
          
          --CRASHES THROUGH a PICTURE WINDOW.

          A handsome HYBRID COUPLE, in pajamas in front of a BIG SCREEN
          TV. They turn and react as the ATV skitters through the room
          and down a hallway. The ATV is followed a moment later by--
          
          --THE TANK, which TAKES OUT THE ENTIRE WALL, BARRELLING
          through the living room and BURYING the HYBRIDS in RUBBLE.

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS takes the ATV UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
          
          THE TANK keeps SMASHING through the house, as its TURRET
          SWIVELS upward and BLASTS AWAY.
          
          UPSTAIRS - THE PLASMA BLAST COMES THROUGH the FLOOR, just
          missing the ATV as it rockets through a MASTER BEDROOM,
          toward a BALCONY.
          
          DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK tears through an upscale RECREATION
          ROOM, splintering a POOL TABLE, smashing through PINBALL
          MACHINES.
          
          UPSTAIRS - MARCUS takes the ATV straight out onto the
          BALCONY, THROUGH THE RAILING and INTO THE AIR.
          
          DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK BLASTS THROUGH a KITCHEN and BATHROOM
          on its way out the other side of the house.
          
          
          EXT.   LUXURY HOME/BACK YARD - NIGHT
          
          THE ATV JUST CLEARS an enormous SWIMMING POOL, landing hard
          on the far deck and moving on, fast.
          
          THE TANK SMASHES THROUGH THE BACK WALL and--
          
          --TAKES A NOSEDIVE into the pool, out of commission.
          
          
          INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT
          
          THE RUBBLE in the living room shifts and the HYBRID COUPLE
          extract themselves, taking in their destroyed home with
          placid expressions.
          
          
          EXT.   RESIDENTIAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT
          
          A moment's breather. Marcus slows the vehicle, which WOBBLES
          and SMOKES from all it's been through. He looks around.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Where are we going?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There.
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          He points toward the COAST, we see a MARINA in the distance,
          a BOAT moored at a DOCK.
          
          MARCUS steers the ATV down a slope toward the shoreline.
          
          
          EXT.   COASTLINE/DOCK - NIGHT/DAWN
          
          MARCUS, KYLE and STAR leap off the ATV and sprint for a
          MOTORBOAT. Kyle carries the rifle now.
          
          As they near the boat, MARCUS reacts to the sight of--
          
          --RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK,
          the BLUE GLOW of a RIFLE CHARGING.
          
          MARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with
          his BODY. The PLASMA BLAST envelops him, MARCUS is blown--
          
          --INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force
          of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE
          lies a few feet away.
          
          THE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down
          the dock, its PLASMA RIFLE trained on the water now. It
          moves past Kyle and Star, who remain motionless on the
          ground, and goes to the edge of the dock--
          
          --BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS
          the thing in the back, knocking it INTO THE WATER, which is
          only a few feet deep here. As it rises, SHE FIRES again,
          taking the Terminator's head off. It goes under.
          
          THE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later,
          MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back
          onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment.
          
          Seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage--
          there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE
          partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but
          can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK.
          
          Kyle and Star back away from him.
          
                                 KYLE
                       He's not real.
          
          Marcus shakes his head, starts to move toward them.   STAR
          raises the rifle, points it at him.
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
                                 STAR
                       Don't come any closer!
          
          They hear a WHISTLING SOUND from shore, hit the deck as--
          
          --a MISSILE BLAST TAKES OUT THE BOAT and a large chunk of
          DOCK.
          
          Laying low, they look up to see--
          
          --a small army of TANKS and TERMINATORS approaching... even a
          HUNTER-KILLER moving in from the horizon, swinging its
          SPOTLIGHT in all directions. It looks like the last stand.
          
          MARCUS turns back to KYLE and STAR.   His voice is a distorted
          WHISPER.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       I'm sorry.
          
          Star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression.
          She moves to Marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal--
          then hugs him tightly.
          
          Kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea.   His expression
          changes, becomes almost hopeful as--
          
          --IN THE DISTANCE, a HUGE, BLACK SHAPE rises to the surface
          of the water, just visible against the dawn horizon.
          
          FIREWORKS! MISSILES blast the H-K... NAPALM erupts around
          the TANKS and TERMINATOR ARMY as--
          
          --A SQUAD OF A-10s SCREAM IN from over the land, FIRING
          CANNONS, launching AIR-TO GROUND MISSILES to take out the
          TANKS. ONE A-10 flies low overhead and WAGS ITS WINGS.
          
          
          INT.   A-10 COCKPIT - DAWN
          
          BLAIR at the controls, helmeted with her face exposed, lets
          out a VICTORY WHOOP as she looks out her canopy at the
          huddled humans below.
          
          
          EXT.   COASTLINE - DAY
          
          KYLE points to the dark shape on the water-- now visible as a
          huge SUBMARINE with the RISING SUN behind it.

          HIGH ANGLE as ZODIAC BOATS reach land. HAZ-MAT SUITED
          SOLDIERS leap out and run to our heroes at what remains of
          the dock, others head inland to provide covering FIRE.
          
          MARCUS addresses a TEAM LEADER, who's taken aback at his
          frightening appearance and distorted voice:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There are more prisoners, a complex
                       about a mile in--
          
          As MARCUS gives the man a few more directions--
          
          --ONE HAZ-MAT FIGURE, standing a few feet off, studies Kyle
          and approaches.
          
                                 HAZ-MAT MAN
                       What's your name, son?
          
                                 KYLE
                       Kyle Reese.
          
          The figure pulls off a glove and unzips his mask, extends a
          hand. It's JOHN CONNOR.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       John Connor. I'm glad you made it.
          
          KYLE is amazed to be meeting the man face-to-face. He shakes
          hands, wide-eyed and speechless. It's a strange moment for
          Connor, too, for different reasons.
          
          CONNOR turns away from his first meeting with his father to
          be, a bit dizzy at the experience. He addresses Marcus.
          
                                 CONNOR (cont'd)
                       Seems I owe you an apology.
          
          MARCUS smiles as best he can, given his ruined face.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, well. Get in line.
          
          WIDER, as CONNOR replaces his mask, moves to direct his
          troops. MARCUS, KYLE and STAR stay close together.

          INT.   SUBMARINE/HATCH AREA - DAY
          
          Near the ENGINE ROOM, a couple dozen RESCUED PRISONERS are
          being treated by unarmed MEDICAL PERSONNEL, others huddle
          under blankets with food and drink. KATE is among those
          helping the former prisoners.
          
          KYLE and STAR eat ravenously, he finishes one MRE and grabs
          up another. A few feet away, MARCUS leans against a wall,
          plasma RIFLE at his side. A DOCTOR examines him warily,
          prodding his injured face.
          
                               DOCTOR
                     Does this hurt?
          
                               MARCUS
                     I don't feel a thing.    Help
                     somebody else.
          
          The doctor moves on as a couple of HAZ-MAT SUITED FIGURES
          come down the ladder from the hatch, FACE-MASKS removed.
          Among them is CONNOR. KATE moves to his side as more dazed
          HUMANS come down. She speaks quietly, eying KYLE nearby.
          
                               KATE
                     Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid.
          
          Connor can't deal with that at the moment, speaks loudly.
          
                               CONNOR
                     The last boatload is right behind
                     me. Skynet's pouring in
                     reinforcements, we can't hold this
                     place. And the people in the
                     houses, they won't leave--
          
                               MARCUS
                     They're not people anymore...
          
          He trails off, reacting to the sight of--
          
          A FAMILIAR FIGURE descending the ladder, in a long coat, head
          down. She looks up to make eye contact... SERENA.
          
                               MARCUS (cont'd)
                     No!
          
          SLO-MO:   seeing Marcus, Serena reaches into her coat--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS moves at the same time, to grab his PLASMA RIFLE--
          
          SERENA leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful PLASMA
          WEAPON.
          
          SERENA fires first--
          
          BLAM! THE PLASMA BLAST catches MARCUS in the shoulder and
          BLOWS his GUN ARM clean off. His PLASMA RIFLE discharges,
          BLOWING a HOLE in the side of the sub, near the floor-- WATER
          gushes in like a FIREHOSE.
          
          LEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS
          lands on his back, SPARKS and SEVERED CABLES protruding from
          his damaged shoulder. An ALARM KLAXON SOUNDS.
          
          PRISONERS and DOCTORS SCREAM and scramble for cover--
          
          CONNOR steps in front of KATE to shield her, they back away
          through the WATER BLAST, CONNOR FIRING at SERENA--
          
          SERENA takes numerous HITS from the EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, which
          take off PIECES of her, but she keeps coming, FIRES again--
          
          --HITTING CONNOR in the lower abdomen. He's thrown backward,
          KATE cries out and throws herself on top of him. His gun has
          gone flying.
          
          SERENA turns her attention to MARCUS, standing over him,
          plasma weapon aimed point-blank at his head.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Why, Marcus? You were immortal...
          
          MARCUS manages a smile as he shakes his head.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       No one lives forever.
          
          BLAM! MULTIPLE PLASMA BLASTS from behind RIDDLE SERENA'S
          TORSO, the BLUE PULSES burning right through her-- her HEAD
          takes a hit, the STEEL is RUPTURED.
          
          THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES.
          
          TIGHT ON HER FACE, as she turns to see who got her--
          
          There's no one there.    But ON THE FLOOR lies--

          SERENA'S HEAD tilts, her eyes go blank-- she's dead.
          
          MEDICAL PERSONNEL are doing what they can to help CONNOR,
          blood at his lips, KATE and KYLE at his side.

          MARCUS waits outside the entrance to the SICKBAY. He's
          cleaned up a bit, wears fresh clothes (one sleeve pinned up).
          He seems weary, wrung out, his systems damaged. He'll move
          stiffly through the following scene, like a stroke victim.
          
          STAR sits beside him, a hand on his arm.   BLAIR approaches
          from down the corridor.

                     unit.
          
          MARCUS nods, keeps his head bowed.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     What about you?
          
          His voice is still WEAK.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I have no idea. I should be dead...
          
                               STAR
                     But you're alive.

                                 MARCUS
                           (a half-smile)
                       So to speak.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       We've been ordered not to talk
                       about it-- the hybrids, everything
                       about that place is top secret...
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus
                       machine.
          
          Star gingerly reaches up to touch the torn plastic at the
          back of Marcus' head, where the interface was.
          
                                  STAR
                           (BEAT)
                       What did it feel like?   To be...
                       one of them?
          
                                 MARCUS
                           (thoughtful beat)
                       Better than anything. Everything made
                       sense. For the first time in my life,
                       I felt... right. It was heaven.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       How could you give that up?
          
          He turns to her, exposing his mangled face, one eye gone.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I never really believed in heaven.
          
          BLAIR takes this in, fishes in a pocket.
          
                                  BLAIR
                       Here.   You need these more than I do.
          
          She holds out a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.     MARCUS, a bit amused,
          slips them on.
          
          THE DOOR opens nearby and an ashen-faced KATE emerges.
          
                                 KATE
                       He wants to see you.
          
          BLAIR gives MARCUS a farewell hug.
          
                                                                         111.
          
          
          INT.   SUBMARINE SICKBAY - DAY
          
          CONNOR has a PRIVATE MEDICAL AREA set aside. He's not
          looking good-- pale, weak, only semi-conscious. I.V.s and
          MONITORS, other LIFE-SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. KYLE is with Connor,
          staring at a small POLAROID PHOTO in his hand. CONNOR can
          barely speak above a whisper.
          
                                CONNOR
                     Her name was Sarah... she was...
                     amazing...
          
                               KYLE
                     I don't remember my mother.
          
          KYLE starts to hand the photo back, CONNOR waves it away.
          
                                CONNOR
                     Keep it.
          
          KYLE is a bit puzzled, but obediently keeps the snapshot.
          KATE enters with MARCUS, touches the boy's shoulder.
          
                               KATE
                     Kyle, could you give us a minute?
          
          KYLE reluctantly leaves, still looking at the photo, with a
          nod to MARCUS on the way out. He joins STAR in the doorway,
          they go off together.
          
          KATE, CONNOR and MARCUS are alone now. Throughout scene,
          Kate fights to maintain a steely control-- but she's clearly
          not far from tears.
          
                               KATE (cont'd)
                     Marcus... you're going to need to
                     be rebuilt. Your face, your body,
                     your voice...
                         (off his shrug)
                     We have people who can do it.
          
          She pulls some MEDICAL DIAGRAMS out of a drawer, lays them
          before Marcus. He examines--
          
          --a SCANNED IMAGE of his FACE, various elements HIGHLIGHTED.
          
                               KATE (cont'd)
                     But you won't be the same...
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features
          TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN
          CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.
          
                                 KATE (cont'd)
                       The scar will help hide the change.
          
          Marcus lowers the papers, absorbing this.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       You're asking me to become...
                            (gesturing at Connor)
                       Him?
          
          Connor can barely speak above a whisper:
          
                                   CONNOR
                       You must.
          
                                 KATE
                           (QUIETLY)
                       We can't keep him alive much longer.
                           (shakes her head, swallows)
                       Very few people know what John
                       actually looks like. Only the
                       technicians and our closest advisors
                       need ever know the truth.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Why me?
          
                                 KATE
                       Who else? Only you know the enemy
                       from the inside. You liberated a
                       Skynet camp... you're a hero.
          
          Connor gestures for Marcus to move closer, he speaks with
          great effort:
          
                                 CONNOR
                       I never knew how I was supposed to
                       win this war. But I finally
                       understand: the idea of John Connor
                       is more important than the person.
                           (sinks back, spent)
                       I can die. He cannot.
          
          Kate leans toward Marcus, who's lost in thought.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
                                KATE
                     Please.   We need you.
          
          MARCUS bows his head for a long beat, as if seeking an answer
          from within. Then he looks up again with resolve.
          
          He lifts his hand-- the SKIN TATTERED, METAL exposed at
          finger joints-- and moves to take CONNOR'S TREMBLING HAND.
          
                                                             CUT TO:

          SLOW-MOTION, MOS - a SNOWY, MOUNTAINOUS ENVIRONMENT...
          
          STEEL TERMINATORS go down in HAILS OF BULLETS.   We hear
          Marcus' VO, his voice strong and assured:
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.)
                     Yea, though I walk through the
                     valley of the shadow of death...
          
          AN ARMY of HUMAN RESISTANCE FIGHTERS marches through the
          SNOW, GUNS BLAZING.
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     ...I shall fear no evil...
          
          AN H-K goes down IN FLAMES, SMASHES in the MOUNTAINSIDE.
          
          THE GOLDEN EXPLOSION silhouettes a single FIGURE, who stands
          on a PROMONTORY, surveying the battle below. AIDES and
          SOLDIERS surround him, but he towers over them, giving
          orders, in complete control. MOVE IN SLOWLY on him.
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     I died, and was reborn. I wear
                     another man's face, lead another
                     man's life... yet only now do I
                     have a reason for living. I once
                     was lost, but now I'm found...
          
          ANOTHER BLAST illuminates his face for an instant-- scarred,
          craggy, a blend of Marcus and Connor-- but fierce, determined
          and proud. [Perhaps shoot this with both actors.]
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     ...was blind, but now I see.

          FADE IN:

          On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
          with a billion stars.
          Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
          BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
          breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

          1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1

          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
          amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
          down the street and heads out of town.

          2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2

          The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
          at the sky.
          JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
          constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
          spare parts of other devices.

                         JANE
          Hurry!
          We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
          Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
          well, rubbing his head.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh-- watch your head.

                         SELVIG
          Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"
          of yours supposed to look like?

                         JANE
          It's a little different each time.
          Once it looked like, I don't know,
          melted stars, pooling in a corner
          of the sky. But last week it was a
          rolling rainbow ribbon--

                         SELVIG

                         (GENTLY TEASING)
          "Racing "round Orion?" I've always
          said you should have been a poet.
          Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.

                         JANE
          Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
          my gloves, will you?
          Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
          a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Not until you see it!

                         SELVIG
          (re: the gloves)
          I recognize those. Think how proud
          he'd be to see you now.
          Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.

                         JANE
          Thank you.

                         SELVIG
          For what?

                         JANE
          The benefit of the doubt.
          The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
          they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          It's never taken this long before.
          Darcy calls up from the front seat.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Can I turn on the radio?

                         JANE
          (an edge to her voice)
          Sure, if you like rocking out to
          KFRM, "All agriculture, all the
          time."
          Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

          3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3

          The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
          equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
          together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
          handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
          frustrated Jane with sympathy.

                         JANE
          The anomalies are always
          precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
          She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
          tracking occurrences and patterns.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          The last seventeen occurrences have
          been predictable to the minute... I
          just don't understand.
          Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
          She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
          the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.

                         DARCY
          Jane?
          Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
          champagne begins to vibrate.

                         JANE
          There's got to be some new
          variable... Or an equipment
          malfunction...
          The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
          them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.

                         DARCY
          I don't think there's anything
          wrong with your equipment...
          The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
          shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
          They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
          the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
          everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Jane?

                         JANE
          What?!

                         DARCY
          I think you want to see this.
          Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
          the desert --

          MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
          Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

                         JANE
          Holy. Shatner.

                         SELVIG
          That's your "subtle" aurora?!

                         JANE
          No-- yes! Let's go!

          4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4

          The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
          event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
          out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
          The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
          her, yanks her back in.

          5 INT. SUV 5

          Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

                         JANE
          Isn't this great?!
          A thought strikes her.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          You're seeing it too, right? I'm
          not crazy?

                         SELVIG
          That's debateable. Put your seat
          belt on!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.
          The SUV lurches.

          6 EXT. DESERT 6

          Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
          out of the clouds comes --

          AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
          Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
          thousand freight trains as it touches down.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.

          7 INT. SUV 7

          Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
          enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
          into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
          window, TAPING the storm.

                         JANE
          You've gotta get us closer so I can
          take a magnetic reading.
          Darcy laughs.

                         DARCY
          Yeah, right! Good one!
          (then, realizing)
          Oh God, you're serious...

                         JANE
          You want those college credits or
          not?

          8 EXT. SUV 8

          The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
          leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
          two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
          take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
          strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
          them with a terrifying intensity.

          9 INT. SUV 9

          The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
          the wheel, starts to head away.

                         DARCY
          Keep the credits. I'll intern at
          Burger King.

                         JANE
          What are you doing?!

                         DARCY
          Saving our lives!
          Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
          struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --

                         A MAN

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
          Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
          slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
          The SUV swerves -- but too late.

          10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10

          The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
          him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

          11 INT. SUV 11

          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
          They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
          A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

          12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12

          The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
          man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
          charred and blackened.

                         DARCY
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

                         JANE
          Get the first aid kit.
          Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
          next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
          She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
          clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
          long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
          features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
          the life back into him.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.
          Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
          his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
          azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
          them.
          For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
          The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
          freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.

                         DARCY
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.
          A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
          She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

                         JANE

                         HIS EYES--

                         DARCY

                         (DREAMILY)
          --are beautiful.

                         JANE
          --are dilating. That's a good
          sign.

                         SELVIG
          We still have to get him to a
          hospital.

                         JANE

                         (HOPEFULLY)
          After we get a reading on the
          storm?

                         SELVIG
          Immediately, Jane.
          Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
          above their heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
          glowing remnants of the storm, and into:

          13 EXT. SPACE 13

          EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
          resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.)
          Questions, they've always asked
          questions -- this race called man,
          on this planet they call earth.
          Passionately longing to know how
          they are connected to the heavens.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
          We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
          cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
          galaxy.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In ages past, they looked to us as
          gods, for indeed so many times we
          saved them from calamity. We tried
          to show them how their world was
          but one of the Nine Realms of the
          Cosmos, linked to all others by the
          branches of Yggdrasil...
          We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
          sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
          shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
          out into the black void of space.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
          a universe of wonder, beauty, and
          terror that they barely
          comprehended.
          We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
          a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But for all their thirst for
          knowledge, they let our lessons
          fall into myth and dreams.
          Where did he come from? He came
          from us, the proudest race of
          warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
          He came from this -- the greatest
          Realm the universe has ever known.
          We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
          over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
          what's on the other side:

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He came... from Asgard!

          14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14

          Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
          landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
          modern yet timeless.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.

          15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15

          The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
          other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
          out before it.
          We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE

                         STANDS --

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
          land at his side.

          16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16

          Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
          vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.

                         ODIN
          Do you think he's ready?

                         FRIGGA
          He thinks he is. He has his
          father's confidence.

                         ODIN
          He'll need his father's wisdom.

                         FRIGGA
          And his humility?
          Odin reacts.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
          at his side to give him counsel.
          Have faith in your sons.

                         ODIN
          Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
          could be a great King...
          Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
          synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
          as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
          trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
          sheer will.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
          Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
          A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (QUIETLY)
          ...if we only had more time.

                         FRIGGA
          For once, our son needs something
          we cannot provide.

                         ODIN
          I can fight it a little longer...

                         FRIGGA
          No. You've put it off too long! I
          worry for you.
          He touches her cheek.

                         ODIN
          I've destroyed demons and monsters,
          devastated whole worlds, laid waste
          to mighty kingdoms, and still you
          worry for me?

                         FRIGGA
          Always.

                         ODIN
          Not today. Now come kiss your
          king... while I'm still king.
          He pulls her close, and they kiss.

          17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17

          Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
          hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
          fire lit room.
          Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
          against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
          recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
          Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
          An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
          He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
          below.

                         THOR
          Another!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
          The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
          intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
          length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
          He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
          the Hall.
          We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
          shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
          horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
          from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
          horned headpiece.
          Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
          a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
          throne room.

                         LOKI

                         (TO THOR)
          Nervous, brother?

                         THOR
          Have you ever known me to be
          nervous?

                         LOKI
          There was the time in Nornheim...

                         THOR
          That wasn't nerves, brother. It
          was the rage of battle. How else
          could I have fought my way through
          a hundred warriors and pulled us
          out alive?
          The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
          Thor.

                         LOKI
          As I recall, I was the one who
          veiled us in smoke to ease our
          escape.

                         THOR
          Some do battle, others just do
          tricks.
          The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
          it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
          EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
          across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
          goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Loki...
          Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
          back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that was just a waste of good
          wine.

                         LOKI
          Just a bit of fun.
          (to the Attendant)
          Right, my friend?
          The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED

          HELMET.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          (re: Thor's helmet)
          Nice feathers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.

                         THOR
          You don't really want to start this
          again, do you, Cow?

                         LOKI
          I was being sincere!

                         THOR
          You're incapable of sincerity.

                         LOKI
          Am I?
          He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I've looked forward to this day as
          long as you have. You're my
          brother and my friend. Sometimes
          I'm envious, but never doubt that I
          love you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
          Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
          He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
          liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
          brother's shoulder.

                         THOR
          Thank you.
          The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

                         LOKI
          Give us a kiss.

                         THOR
          Stop.
          Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          How do I look?

                         LOKI
          Like a king.
          They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It's time.

                         THOR
          You go ahead.
          Loki casts him a wary look.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'll be along. Go on.
          Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.

          17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A

          VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
          event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
          stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
          eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
          FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
          moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
          holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
          dreamily.

                         FANDRAL
          Thank you, love.
          (to the Maidens)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.

                         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Now who'd like to polish my sword
          for me?
          The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
          HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
          of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
          the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
          ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
          Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
          Attendant quickly backs away.
          From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
          SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
          HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
          reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
          on the table.

                         SIF
          (to the weapons)
          I'll miss you.

          18 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18

          Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
          room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
          Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
          Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
          the front of the hall. They are:

          THE WARRIORS THREE
          VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
          oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
          swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
          HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
          side.
          With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
          a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
          with.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I hope this goes quickly. I'm
          famished.

                         FANDRAL

                         (FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
          Noooo!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Are you attached to that pretty
          face of yours? Because one more
          word, and you won't be.

                         FANDRAL
          (to the others)
          My, we are hungry, aren't we?
          The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do
          it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
          Just one smile.
          Hogun stares at him grimly.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          All right, half a smile. Look,
          forget the smile, just show some
          teeth.

                         SIF
          Fandral, is it true the famous
          Warriors Three are ready to meet
          any challenge?

                         FANDRAL
          Name it, Lady Sif.

                         SIF
          Keep your mouth shut.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12.

          19 INT. VAULT - DAY 19

          Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready,
          stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath
          the palace.
          A cold BREEZE blows past them.

          19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A

          Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his
          hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.

                         FRIGGA
          It's all right to be nervous.

                         THOR
          Why does everyone keep saying that?
          I'm not nervous!

                         FRIGGA
          You may be able to fool the rest of

                         ASGARD --

                         THOR
          ...but never you. I know.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor, just remember that you have
          something even the great Allfather
          never had.

                         THOR
          And what is that?

                         FRIGGA
          Me for a mother.
          She smiles.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Now don't keep your father waiting.
          Frigga leaves.

          20 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20

          Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki
          and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the
          hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,
          the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into
          formation. They part to reveal --

                         ODIN

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.
          Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
          holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
          him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
          Ruler of Asgard.
          Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
          casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
          seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
          A murmur spreads through the crowd.

                         VOLSTAGG
          (sotto, to Loki)
          Where is he?

                         LOKI
          He said he'd be along.
          Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What?

                         SIF
          He wants to make an entrance.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
          he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
          like he's ready to feed him to his
          ravens.

                         LOKI
          I wouldn't worry. Father will
          forgive him. He always does.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13.
          Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
          lower level --

                         MJOLNIR
          Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
          behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
          CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
          before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
          adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.

                         SIF
          Oh, please.
          Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

          21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21

          As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
          breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
          warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
          something's not right.
          They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
          hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
          pedestal.
          LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
          SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

          22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22

          Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
          of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
          Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
          her. She can't help but smile.
          Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
          The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
          authority.
          He raises Gungnir before him.

                         ODIN
          Gungnir. Its aim is true, its
          power strong. With it I have
          defended Asgard and the lives of
          the innocent across the Nine Realms
          since the time of the Great
          Beginning. And though the day has
          come for a new King to wield his
          own weapon -- that duty remains the
          same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my
          first-born.

          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A.

                         ODIN (CONT'D)
          So long entrusted with this mighty
          hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the
          heart of a dying star, from the
          sacred metal of Uru. Only one may
          lift it. Only one is worthy. Who
          wields this hammer commands the
          lightning and the storm. Its power
          has no equal -- as a weapon, to
          destroy, or as a tool, to build.
          It is a fit companion for a King.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 14.

          23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23

          The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
          strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
          catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
          and BLUE-SKINNED.
          One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
          to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
          Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
          standing in the shadows behind it.
          As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
          They turn back around.
          Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

          24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24

          The Ceremony continues.

                         ODIN
          Today I entrust you with the
          greatest honor in all the Nine
          Realms. The sacred throne of
          Asgard. I have sacrificed much to
          achieve peace. So, too, must a new
          generation sacrifice to maintain
          that peace. Responsibility, duty,
          honor. These are not merely
          virtues to which we must aspire.
          They are essential to every soldier
          and to every King.
          The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
          their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
          hall.
          Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
          with pride.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard
          the Nine Realms?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to preserve the peace?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to cast aside all
          selfish ambition and pledge
          yourself only to the good of all
          the Realms?
          Beat.

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Then on this day, I, Odin
          Allfather, proclaim you--
          Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE
          creeps across the surface of the large banners around the
          hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,
          and the crowd see it too.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (REALIZING)
          Frost giants...
          The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the
          palace below. Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their
          weapons, as Thor races from the hall.

          25B INT. VAULT - DAY 25B

          Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
          Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
          stop short.
          Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
          We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
          clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
          remains on the floor.
          They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
          Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
          creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
          It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

                         SIF
          The Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          I thought it was but a legend.
          Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
          the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
          the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
          Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.

                         FANDRAL
          I've never been inside the Vault
          before. It's said the Tesseract
          was once held here.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          The Tesseract? I thought that was
          but a legend too!

                         SIF
          Shush!
          Odin surveys the destruction.

                         THOR
          The Jotuns must pay for what
          they've done!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.

                         ODIN
          They have paid with their lives.
          The Destroyer did its job, and the
          Casket is safe. All is well.

                         THOR
          "All is well?!" They broke into
          the Weapons Vault! If the Frost
          Giants had stolen even one of these

                         RELICS--

                         ODIN
          But they didn't.

                         THOR
          I want to know why they--

                         ODIN

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          The Casket of Ancient Winters
          belonged to the Jotuns. They
          believe it's their birthright.

                         THOR
          And if you hadn't taken it from
          them they would have laid waste to
          all the Nine Realms!

                         ODIN
          I have a truce with Laufey, the
          Jotun King.

                         THOR
          He just broke your truce! We must
          act!
          Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.

                         ODIN
          Leave us.
          Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          And what action would you take?

                         THOR
          March into Jotunheim as you once
          did, teach them a lesson, break
          their spirits so they'll never dare
          try to cross our borders again!

                         ODIN
          You're thinking only as a warrior!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16B.

                         THOR
          This was an act of war!

                         ODIN
          It was the act of but a few, doomed
          to fail.

                         THOR
          They got this far!

                         ODIN
          We will find the breach in our
          defenses. It will be found, and it
          will be sealed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17.

                         THOR
          As King of Asgard, I would--

                         ODIN
          You are not King. Not yet.
          Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far
          as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the
          doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin
          watches him go.

          26 INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26

          Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the
          festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger
          and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the
          massive tables.
          From across the room, Loki watches him.

          AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE
          Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
          search of his dinner.

                         SIF
          Redecorating, are we?
          Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What's this -- ?!

                         HOGUN
          I told you they'd cancel it.

                         FANDRAL
          We thought that was just you being
          your normal cheery self.
          Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          All this food -- so innocent, cast
          to the ground. It breaks the
          heart!
          Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
          calmly moves towards him.

                         THOR
          It's unwise to be in my company
          right now, brother.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18.

                         LOKI
          Who said I was wise?

                         THOR
          (re: the empty hall)
          This was to be my day of triumph.

                         LOKI
          It will come. In time.

                         (ADMITS)
          If it's any consolation, I think
          you're right. About the Frost
          Giants, about Laufey, everything.
          If a few of them could penetrate
          the defenses of Asgard once, who's
          to say they won't try again. Next
          time with an army?

                         THOR
          Yes, exactly!

                         LOKI
          But there's nothing we can do
          without defying Father.
          Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
          Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          No... stop there! I know that
          look!

                         THOR
          It's the only way to ensure the
          safety of our borders.

                         LOKI
          It's madness!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Madness? What sort of madness?

                         LOKI
          Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

                         THOR
          The safety of our Realm is no jest.
          We're going to Jotunheim.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19.

                          FANDRAL
          What?!

                          SIF
          Thor, of all the laws of Asgard,
          this is one you must not break.
          Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.

                         FANDRAL
          This isn't like a journey to Earth,
          where you summon a little lightning
          and thunder and the mortals worship
          you as a god. This is Jotunheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And if the Frost Giants don't kill
          you, your Father will!

                         THOR
          My father fought his way into
          Jotunheim, defeated their armies,
          and took their Casket! We'd just
          be looking for answers.

                         SIF
          It is forbidden!
          Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
          case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.

                         THOR
          My friends, have you forgotten all
          that we've done together?
          He turns to Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Who brought you into the sweet
          embrace of the most exotic maidens
          in all of Yggdrasil?

                         FANDRAL
          You did.

                         THOR

                         (TO HOGUN)
          Who led you into the most glorious
          of battles...

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          ...and to delicacies so succulent,
          you thought you'd died and gone to
          Valhalla?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.

                         VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
          You did. / You did.
          He turns to Sif.

                         THOR
          And who proved wrong all who
          scoffed at the idea that a young
          maiden could be one of the fiercest
          warriors this Realm has ever known?

                         SIF
          I did.

                         THOR

                         (QUICKLY)
          True. But I supported you...
          (then, to the others)
          My friends, trust me now. We must
          do this.
          The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
          convincing him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Come on. You're not going to let
          my brother and me take all the
          glory, are you?
          Loki looks startled.

                         LOKI
          What?

                         THOR
          You are coming with me...

                         LOKI
          Yes, of course! I won't let my
          brother march into Jotunheim alone.
          I will be at his side.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And I.

                         FANDRAL
          And I.

                         HOGUN
          And I. The Warriors Three fight
          together.

                         SIF
          I fear we'll live to regret this.

                         VOLSTAGG
          If we're lucky.

          27 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27

          Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace,
          across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who
          ready their battle gear for their journey.
          Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
          Hogun notices.

                         THOR
          We must first find a way to get
          past Heimdall.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That will be no easy task. It's
          said the Gatekeeper can see a
          single dew drop fall from a blade
          of grass a thousand worlds away.

                         FANDRAL
          And he can hear a cricket passing
          gas in Niffelheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Jest not! He heareth all!

                         FANDRAL
          Please. Getting past him should be
          simple enough now, since he seems
          to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
          under his nose.
          Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Forgive him! He meaneth no
          offense!
          Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.

          28 EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28

          Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
          the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
          most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

          THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
          Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
          mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
          ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
          Observatory.

          29 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29

          The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
          Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
          them, blocking their way, staring them down.
          There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
          Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
          intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
          glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

                         LOKI
          Keep your weapons sheathed and your
          mouths closed. This is going to
          take subtlety and sincerity, not
          brute strength. Leave it to me.
          Loki dismounts and steps forward.

          LOKI (CONT'D)

                         GOOD HEIMDALL--

                         HEIMDALL
          You're not dressed warmly enough.
          Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.

                         LOKI
          I'm sorry?

                         HEIMDALL
          The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It
          will kill you all in time, even
          Thor.

                         (THEN)
          You think you can deceive me? I,
          who watch all? I, who can sense
          the flapping of a butterfly's wings
          a thousand worlds away?
          He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.

          HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
          Or can hear a cricket passing gas
          in Niffelheim?
          Fandral looks gob-smacked.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.

                         FANDRAL
          That was just a bit of a jest,
          really...
          Loki goes into damage control.

                         LOKI
          You must be mistaken. We're not--

                         THOR

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          Enough.

                         (TO HEIMDALL)
          Heimdall, may we pass?
          Heimdall stares him down.

                         HEIMDALL
          For ages have I guarded Asgard and
          kept it safe from those who would
          do it harm. In all that time,
          never has an enemy slipped by my
          watch -- until this day. I wish to
          know how that happened.

                         THOR
          Then tell no one where we've gone
          until we've returned.
          Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
          pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
          him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What happened? Your silver tongue
          turn to lead?

                         LOKI
          Get me off this bridge before it
          cracks under your girth.
          Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.

          30 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30

          Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
          platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
          at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.

                         HEIMDALL
          Be warned. I will honor my sworn
          oath to protect this Realm as its
          Gatekeeper. If your return
          threatens the safety of Asgard,
          Bifrost will remain closed to you.
          You'll be left to die in the cold
          wastes of Jotunheim.

                         THOR
          I have no plans to die today.

                         HEIMDALL
          None do.
          Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
          apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

          31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31

          The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
          the Observatory.

          32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32

          Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
          Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
          section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
          sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
          the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
          The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
          and his five comrades stand.

                         HEIMDALL
          All is ready. You may pass.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Couldn't you just leave the bridge
          open for us?

                         HEIMDALL
          To keep this bridge open would
          unleash the full power of the
          Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
          you upon it.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Ah. Never mind, then.
          Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
          grins.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.

                         THOR
          Come on. Don't be bashful.
          The others join him at his side, then step towards the
          Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
          changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
          elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
          off the platform and inside the vortex.

          33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33

          A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
          out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
          and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
          imprinted on the ice around them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
          Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
          grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
          precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
          inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

                         THOR
          Come on, big fella. Up...!
          With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
          ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:

                         VOLSTAGG
          This belt! This belt is now my
          lucky belt! I will never remove
          it! Even when bathing!

                         FANDRAL
          You bathe?
          Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
          at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
          is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
          apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
          and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
          and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
          city lies in the distance.

                         HOGUN
          We shouldn't be here.

                         THOR
          Too late now.

                         FANDRAL
          Actually, it's not. We could turn
          right around, hop back to Asgard,
          share a mug by the fire. Could be
          nice.
          Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps we should wait.
          Thor turns back to his brother.

                         THOR
          For what?

                         LOKI
          To survey the enemy. To gauge
          their strengths and weaknesses from
          a distance.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I'm liking that. Gauging,
          surveying. Particularly the
          distance part.

                         THOR
          We know all we must. It's time to
          act.
          Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

                         SIF
          He's just got to swing his
          hammer...

          34 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34

          The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
          shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
          looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
          Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

                         THOR
          It feels good, doesn't it? To be
          together again, adventuring on
          another world?

                         FANDRAL
          Adventuring? Is that what we're
          doing?

                         THOR
          What would you call it?

                         FANDRAL
          Freezing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Starving.

                         SIF
          Whining.

                         THOR
          How about a song to lift our
          spirits?
          The others groan.

                         HOGUN
          No, not that!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.

                         SIF
          Please don't make us sing again!

                         FANDRAL
          If I have to listen to Volstagg's
          singing voice one more time, I'll
          fall on my own sword!

                         SIF
          Well, now I'm on board.
          She and Thor share a grin.
          The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
          structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
          warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
          central plaza.

          SIF (CONT'D)
          Where are they?

                         THOR
          Hiding. As cowards always do.
          Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
          Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
          FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.

          35 EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35

          The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
          the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
          The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
          A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.

                         JOTUN SENTRY
          What is your business here,
          Asgardian?
          The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.

                         THOR
          I speak only to your King. Not to
          his foot soldiers.

          JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
          Then speak.
          Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
          where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
          waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
          proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
          his people have endured.

                         LAUFEY
          I am Laufey, King of this Realm.

                         THOR
          And I am--

                         LAUFEY
          We know who you are, Odinson. Why
          have you brought the stench of your
          blood into my world?

                         THOR
          I demand answers.
          Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.

                         LAUFEY
          You "demand?"

                         THOR
          How did your people get into
          Asgard?

                         LAUFEY
          The house of Odin is full of
          traitors.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
          by the Jotun King's words.

                         THOR
          Do not dishonor my father's name
          with your lies.

                         LAUFEY
          Your father is a murderer and a
          thief. He stole what was ours, and
          left our world in ruins. We have
          the right to reclaim the Casket.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.

                         THOR
          Not when you'd use it to make war
          against other Realms.
          Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.

                         LAUFEY
          And why have you come here? To
          make peace? You long for battle.
          You crave it. I see you for what
          you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but
          a boy, trying to prove himself a
          man.

                         THOR
          This boy has grown tired of your
          mockery.
          Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
          front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
          Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
          tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
          him.

                         LOKI
          Thor, stop and think. Look around
          you. We are outnumbered.

                         THOR
          Know your place, brother...

                         LAUFEY
          You should listen to his counsel.
          You know not what your actions
          would unleash.
          Laufey steps out of the shadows.

          LAUFEY (CONT'D)
          But I do. Go now, while I still
          allow it.
          Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.

                         LOKI
          We will accept your most gracious
          offer.
          The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
          a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
          breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant
          nearby mutters under his breath.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.

                         JOTUN
          Run back home, little princess.
          Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
          coming.

                         LOKI
          Damn.
          In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
          the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
          draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
          Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Silly hammer! Has a mind of its
          own!
          ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
          around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
          SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

                         FANDRAL
          I'm hoping that's just decorative.
          Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
          Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
          separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
          around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
          this.

                         THOR
          Next!
          Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Well? What move, do you think?

                         VOLSTAGG
          I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."

                         FANDRAL
          At this close range? I think "The
          Alfheim Lunge" is a better move.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (DISGUSTED)
          Maybe if they were three feet tall!
          No! How about "The Randy
          Valkyrie"?

                         HOGUN
          Shut up!
          Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
          loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
          A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
          hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
          mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
          hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
          him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
          back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
          with his mace.
          Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
          double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.

                         SIF
          If you don't treat me like a lady,
          I won't act like a lady!
          She takes out the Jotun.
          Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
          the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
          swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
          The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
          out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
          crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.

                         LOKI
          (to the falling Giant)
          Pathetic.
          He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
          either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
          once.
          Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
          The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
          punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
          long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
          front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
          Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.

                         THOR
          Come on! At least make it a
          challenge for me!
          He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
          tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
          rises, grins.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that's more like it!
          He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
          head over heels.
          Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
          back to his grasp.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          (re: the fallen Brute)
          Ugly and stupid.
          Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
          ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
          Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
          sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
          the chest. The Jotun falls dead.

                         SIF
          (to Hogun, re: knife)
          I'm so glad I taught him how to do
          that!
          Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
          hits in.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You may want to put some ice on
          that!
          The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
          a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
          Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          You may be taller, but I'm wider!
          Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
          flying.
          Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
          sending him crashing to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          It's not too late for you to
          surrender.
          Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
          bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
          Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
          Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
          Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
          ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
          Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
          to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
          opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
          out a small FLASK.
          Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
          to his comrades.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Don't let them grab hold of you!
          He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
          battle.
          Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
          stops mid ice layer.
          The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
          and the warrior drops to one knee.
          Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
          quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
          her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
          chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          (on his belly)
          Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
          had him!

                         SIF
          Of course you did.
          Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
          them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
          bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
          the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
          out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.
          A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
          FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
          Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
          goes.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Hang on!
          Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
          Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
          worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
          close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

                         HOGUN
          Watch the legs!

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (REALIZING)
          Right. Sorry.
          Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
          freeing Hogun's feet.
          Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.

                         FANDRAL
          You really think your icicles are a
          match for Asgardian steel?
          Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
          away.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Fair enough.
          Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
          sword and snaps it in half.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Could we stop just a moment while I
          get another sword?
          Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
          then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
          the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
          through with his own weapon.
          The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
          pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
          forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
          rendering him helpless.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
          Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
          felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
          unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
          them off.
          Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That's unfortunate.
          He hurries to his wounded comrade.

                         FANDRAL
          I may need a bit of help. Not a
          good look, is it?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Just try not to bleed.

                         FANDRAL
          How's the face?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Flawless.
          Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
          stalagmite.
          Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
          Giants.
          The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
          hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
          grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
          his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
          Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
          of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
          -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
          painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
          The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
          unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
          distraction, KICKS the Giant.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
          Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
          the Jotuns around him.

                         THOR
          Come on!
          But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
          Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
          from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
          Mjolnir falls to the ground.
          A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
          ground, to no avail.
          Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
          slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
          leave.
          From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
          it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
          palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
          wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
          The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
          feet.

                         LOKI
          That can't be good.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Yes, it could! Might be an early
          spring!
          They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
          shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
          awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
          Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.

                         LOKI
          Thor, we must go!
          Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
          mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
          look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
          of battle.

                         THOR
          Then go!

                         SIF
          There are too many of them!

                         THOR
          I can stop them!
          The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
          around them.

                         SIF
          Thor!
          But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Run!
          Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
          the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
          chase.
          Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
          The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
          disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

                         MOMENT --

          THOR'S FIST
          Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
          He opens his hand, beckoning.
          One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
          him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
          the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
          raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
          with all his might.
          KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
          channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
          Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
          shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.

          But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
          shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
          where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
          beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          What's Thor done?

                         LOKI
          Likely killed us all!
          As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
          mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
          quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
          The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
          a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
          move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
          Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
          raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
          the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
          comrades.

          35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A

          Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.

                         THOR
          Loki, we have to see.
          Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
          But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of
          the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
          many, even for a Thunder God.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (TO LOKI)
          Actually, could you bring the mists
          back, please?
          Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
          The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
          ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
          down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
          comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
          all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad
          in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.
          The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
          stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
          Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
          his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
          react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
          to-face with Odin.
          Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
          about to happen.
          Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
          Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
          not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of
          earshot of the others.

                         ODIN
          Laufey. End this.

          Your boy sought this out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.

                         ODIN
          You're right. These are the
          actions of a boy. Treat them as
          such. You and I can stop this
          before there's further bloodshed.
          Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
          blade at the end of his arm.

                         LAUFEY
          We are beyond diplomacy now,
          Allfather. He'll get what he came
          for -- war and death.
          Odin looks grim, determined.

                         ODIN
          So be it.
          Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
          Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
          the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
          in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
          The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
          fleeing Jotuns with delight.

                         THOR
          Now! We'll finish them together!

                         ODIN
          Silence!
          Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
          Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops
          the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the
          hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
          Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

          36 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36

          Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls
          Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him.
          Heimdall backs away.

                         THOR
          Why did you bring us back?

                         ODIN
          Do you realize what you've done?
          What you've started?

                         THOR
          I was protecting my home.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34.

                         ODIN
          You cannot protect your friends.
          How can you hope to protect a
          kingdom?
          Odin turns to the others.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (RE: FANDRAL)
          Get him to the healing room!
          Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the
          room.

                         THOR
          There won't be a kingdom to protect
          if you're afraid to act!
          Odin stares at him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Whatever the cost, the world must
          know that the new King of Asgard
          will not be held in contempt.

                         ODIN
          That's pride and vanity that talks!
          Not leadership! Have you forgotten
          everything I've taught you? What
          of a warrior's patience, cunning?

                         THOR
          While you wait and be patient, the
          Nine Realms laugh at us! The old
          ways are done. You'd stand giving
          speeches while Asgard falls!

                         ODIN
          You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

                         THOR
          And you are an old man and a fool!
          The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls
          quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying
          beneath the calmness of his words.

                         ODIN
          A fool, yes! I was a fool to think
          you were ready.
          Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.

                         LOKI

                         FATHER--
          Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his
          tracks.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.

                         ODIN
          Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed
          the express command of your King.
          Through your arrogance and
          stupidity, you have opened these
          peaceful Realms and innocent lives
          to the horrors of war.
          The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control
          panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along
          with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end
          of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor.
          Odin turns angrily to his son.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          You are unworthy of this Realm...
          Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of your title...
          He rips away Thor's cloak.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of the loved ones
          you've betrayed. I hereby take
          from you your powers.
          Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying
          from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          In the name of my father...
          A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor,
          disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the
          chest piece.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...and of his father before...
          Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor,
          including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          I cast you out!
          Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF
          THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and
          disappears in the vortex.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A.
          Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He
          closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something
          quietly.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERING)
          Whosoever holds this hammer, if he
          be worthy, shall possess the power
          of Thor.
          RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its
          smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then
          disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into
          the Bifrost.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          37 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37

          Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's
          blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It
          swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS
          into him, as we:

          CUT TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36.
          After a beat, we hear familiar voices.

          DARCY (V.O.)
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

          JANE (V.O.)
          Get the first aid kit.

                         (THEN)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.

          THOR'S POV
          Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him,
          concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.

          END THOR'S POV

          TIME CUT TO:
          Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their
          heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
          up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
          Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers
          Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls
          her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Uh, thanks. Are you okay?
          Thor searches the ground.

                         THOR
          Hammer...

                         DARCY
          Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
          That's pretty obvious.
          Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
          her flashlight down at the sand.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36A.

                         JANE
          Erik... look at this.
          He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible
          pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look.
          Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and
          snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them
          away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          We've got to move fast before
          anything changes.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          We need soil samples, light
          readings, everything.
          She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
          readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at
          Thor, who stares up at the sky.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, we need get him to a
          hospital.
          Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
          cannister.

                         JANE
          Not right now. It'll take too
          long. County's an hour away.
          We'll drop him off after we're done
          here.
          Selvig looks uncertain.

          JANE (CONT'D)

                         (RE: THOR)
          Look at him, he's fine.
          Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.

                         THOR
          Father! Heimdall! I know you can
          hear me! Open the bridge!

                         JANE
          (off Selvig's look)
          Okay, you and Darcy take him to the
          hospital, I'll stay here.

                         SELVIG
          You expect me to leave you alone in
          the middle of the desert?
          Thor turns to the others, frustrated.

                         THOR
          You! What world is this?
          The group is intimidated by his fervor.

                         SELVIG
          It's all right, my friend. We're
          going to get you some help.
          Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
          agitated, belligerent.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.

                         THOR
          Where am I?! Answer me!
          Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
          Jane looks on, concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.

                         JANE
          Erik, just back away...

                         SELVIG
          (to Thor, calming)
          You're in the desert outside the
          town of Puente Antiguo.

                         THOR
          What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

                         DARCY
          Uh... New Mexico?
          Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
          unsure what to make of it.

                         THOR
          You dare threaten Thor with so puny

                         A--
          Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
          ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the
          ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.

                         DARCY
          What? He was freaking me out.

          38 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38

          As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle
          to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          Next time you decide to taser
          someone, do me a favor and make
          sure they're already inside the
          truck.

                         (TO JANE)
          Jane, come on...
          Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.

          39 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 39

          The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high
          overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost
          energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing
          into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a
          meteor.

                         40 OMITTED 40

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39.

          41 EXT. COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 41

          The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance.

          42 INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 42

          Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two
          ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy
          stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          Name?

                         JANE
          He said it was "Thor."
          The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key
          at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SPELLING)
          T-H-O-R. And your relationship to
          him?

                         JANE
          I've never met him before.

                         DARCY
          Until she hit him with the car.

                         JANE
          Grazed him, actually.

                         (THEN)
          Oh, and we tasered him, too.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Must have been quite the spat.

                         JANE
          I told you, I don't know him. I
          just want to make sure he's okay.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm going to need a name and
          contact number.

                         SELVIG
          Oh, for God's sake...
          He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his
          business card.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          Here. Let's go.
          Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.

          43 INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43

          Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on
          a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his
          arm.

                         NURSE
          Hi. Just taking a little blood.
          Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.

                         THOR
          How dare you attack the son of
          Odin!

                         NURSE
          I need some help!
          Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.

          NURSE (CONT'D)
          We're trying to help you!

                         THOR
          Then bring me a healing stone, you
          savages!
          He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
          couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all
          struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying,
          furniture overturned.

                         ORDERLY
          What the hell is this guy on?
          Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
          looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered
          by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.

                         THOR
          You're no match for the Mighty--
          Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.

          44 EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAWN 44

          Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls
          his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out,
          peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.

                         TOWNIE
          Huh.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A.
          The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
          We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an
          otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object,
          tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts,
          strains with all his might, with no luck.
          He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious
          object.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.

           TOWNIE (CONT'D)
           Huh.

          45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45

          The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
          Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
          desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
          her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
          A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
          Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
          Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
          He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
          entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS". He looks proud.
          The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
          and excitement.

                         JANE
          Darcy, when you're done, take the
          soil samples to Professor Meyers in
          geology. Remind him, he owes me.

                         SELVIG
          We might want to perform a spectral
          analysis.

                         JANE
          "We?"

                         SELVIG
          I flew all the way out here --
          might as well make myself useful.
          This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
          inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
          rack-mounted server.

                         JANE
          You know what would be really
          useful? Do you still have that
          friend at LIGO?

                         SELVIG
          She was more than a friend.

                         JANE
          Could you call in a favor?

                         SELVIG
          You don't think this was just a
          magnetic storm?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.

                         JANE
          If I'm right, their observatory
          must have picked up gravitational
          waves during last night's event.

                         SELVIG
          Meaning?
          Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

                         JANE
          Meaning these anomalies might
          signify something bigger.

                         SELVIG
          How "big" are we talking about?
          Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
          the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
          appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
          covered with stars.

                         JANE
          I think the lensing around the
          edges is characteristic of an
          Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

                         DARCY
          A what?

                         SELVIG
          I thought you were a science major.

                         DARCY
          Political Science.
          Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.

                         JANE
          She was the only applicant.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
          "theoretical" connection between
          two different points of space-time.
          Darcy stares blankly.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          A wormhole.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
          Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
          monitor.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Erik, look...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
          Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
          through the "bubble" in the clouds.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What do you see here?

                         SELVIG
          Stars.

                         JANE
          Yes. But not our stars.
          She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
          excitement.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          This is the star alignment for our
          quadrant, this time of year. So
          unless Ursa Minor decided to take
          the day off... those are someone
          else's constellations.
          Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
          Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
          the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
          image catches her eye.

                         DARCY
          Hey, check it out.
          Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.

                         SELVIG
          Is that...?

                         JANE
          I think I left something at the
          hospital.
          As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
          funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
          of a MAN.

          45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A

          At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the
          balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin,
          looking out over Asgard.

          46 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 46

          Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A.

                         FRIGGA
          How could you have done this?

                         ODIN
          Do you understand what he set in
          motion? He's taken us to the brink
          of war!

                         FRIGGA
          But banishment? You would lose him
          forever? He's your son!

                         ODIN
          What would you have done?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43.

                         FRIGGA
          I would not have exiled him to a
          world of mortals, stripped of his
          powers, to suffer alone. I would
          not have had the heart for such
          cruelty!

                         ODIN
          That is why I'm King.

                         (THEN)
          I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
          But there are some things that even
          I cannot undo.

                         FRIGGA
          You can bring him back.

                         ODIN
          No. His fate is in his own hands
          now.

          47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 47

          Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his
          wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no
          avail.

                         THOR
          It's not possible.
          He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
          slips free from its restraint.

          47A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY 47A

          Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy
          nearby.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm sorry, only relatives can visit
          patients.

                         JANE

                         (THINKING FAST)
          But... I'm his wife.
          Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I thought you said you didn't know
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A.

                         JANE
          I meant I barely know him anymore.
          The man he's become. He's changed.
          I mean, what woman really knows her
          husband, anyway?

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          None of us, dear. He's in Room

          102.

          48 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 48

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the
          destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44.
          They enter Thor's room.

          49 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 49

          They step inside to find Thor's bed empty.

          50 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 50

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV.

          51 INT. JANE'S SUV 51

          Jane starts the car, frustrated.

                         JANE
          Typical. I just lost my most
          important piece of evidence.

                         DARCY
          So now what?

                         JANE
          We find him.

                         SELVIG
          Did you see what he did in there?
          I don't know if finding him is the
          best idea.

                         JANE
          I want to know what that thing was,
          and he may have the answers. We
          don't have a choice.

                         DARCY
          Oo-kay.
          She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.

                         SELVIG
          So we're just going to spend the
          rest of the day looking for him?

                         JANE
          However long it takes.
          Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --

          BAM!
          She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital
          scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44A.

          52 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 52

          Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.

                         JANE
          I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not
          doing that on purpose.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45.
          Thor looks up at the sky.

                         THOR
          Blue sky... one sun... This is
          Earth, isn't it?

                         DARCY
          I think you may have hit him with
          the car one time too many.

                         JANE

                         (TO THOR)
          Let's get you some clothes.

          53 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53

          Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
          shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
          ROARING central fire.
          Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
          STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
          carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
          the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
          comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
          Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
          Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
          blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
          Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
          Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
          its normal color.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We should never have let him go.

                         SIF
          There was no stopping him.

                         FANDRAL
          At least he's only banished, not
          dead. Which is what we'd all be if
          that guard hadn't told Odin where
          we'd gone.

                         VOLSTAGG
          How did the guard even know?
          Loki stares at his arm.

                         LOKI
          I told him.

          What?

                         LOKI
          I told him to go to Odin after we'd
          left. Though he should be flogged
          for taking so long.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You told the guard?

                         LOKI
          I saved our lives! And Thor's. I
          had no idea Father would banish him
          for what he did.

                         SIF
          Loki, you're the only one who can
          help Thor now. You must go to the
          Allfather and convince him to
          change his mind!

                         LOKI
          And if I do, then what? I love
          Thor more dearly than any of you,
          but you know what he is. He's
          arrogant. He's reckless. He's
          dangerous. You saw how he was
          today. Is that what Asgard needs
          from its King?
          The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
          leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

                         SIF
          He may speak about the good of
          Asgard, but he's always been
          jealous of Thor.

                         VOLSTAGG
          True, but we should be grateful to
          him. He did save our lives.

                         HOGUN
          Laufey said there were traitors in
          the House of Odin.
          The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Why is it every time you choose to
          speak, it has to be something dark
          and ominous?

                         HOGUN
          A master of magic could easily
          bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
          The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.

                         VOLSTAGG
          No! Surely not!

                         FANDRAL
          Loki's always been one for
          mischief, but you're talking about
          something else entirely.

          Who else could elude Heimdall's
          gaze with tricks of light and
          shadow?

                         VOLSTAGG
          The ceremony was interrupted just
          before Thor was named King.

                         SIF
          We should go to the Allfather.

                         FANDRAL
          And tell him what? "Oh, by the
          way, we think your son just
          betrayed the throne. And do us a
          favor. Bring back Thor. There's a
          good fellow!"

                         SIF
          It's our duty. If any of our
          suspicions are right, then all of
          Asgard is in danger.

          54 INT. VAULT - DAY 54

          Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
          sitting on its stand.
          He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
          between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
          blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
          The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
          Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
          metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
          the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.

           ODIN (O.S.)
          Stop!
          Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
          goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
          Odin eyes Loki with dismay.

                         LOKI
          Am I cursed?

                         ODIN
          No. Put the Casket down.
          Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
          returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his
          father.

                         LOKI
          What am I?

                         ODIN
          You're my son.

                         LOKI
          What more than that?
          Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
          Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The Casket wasn't the only thing
          you took from Jotunheim that day,
          was it?
          Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

                         ODIN
          No.

                         (BEAT)
          In the aftermath of the battle, I
          went into the Temple, and I found a
          baby. Small for a giant's
          offspring -- abandoned, suffering,
          left to die. Laufey's son.
          Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.

                         LOKI
          Laufey's son...
          He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun
          blood. Why would you take me?

                         ODIN
          You were an innocent child.

                         LOKI
          You took me for a purpose, what was
          it?
          Odin doesn't answer.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Tell me!

                         ODIN
          I thought we could unite our
          kingdoms one day, bring about an
          alliance, bring about a permanent
          peace... through you. But those
          plans no longer matter.

                         LOKI
          So I am no more than another stolen
          relic, locked up here until you
          might have use of me.

                         ODIN
          Why do you twist my words?

                         LOKI
          You could have told me what I was
          from the beginning. Why didn't
          you?

                         ODIN
          You are my son. My blood. I
          wanted only to protect you from the
          truth.

                         LOKI
          Because I am the monster parents
          tell their children about at night?

                         ODIN
          Don't...

                         LOKI
          It all makes sense now. Why you
          favored Thor all these years.

                         ODIN
          Listen...

          Because no matter how much you
          claim to "love" me, you could never
          have a Frost Giant sitting on the
          Throne of Asgard!
          Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
          move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of
          the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries
          to fight it off.

                         ODIN
          Listen to me!
          Loki strides away towards the exit.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Loki!
          Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,
          and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll.
          The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body
          now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving
          trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
          Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a
          scream. He collapses to the stone floor.
          Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms,
          calls out.

          Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the
          sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.

          59 EXT. INSIDE OF CRATER 59

          It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on
          lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
          watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a
          line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
          One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
          the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the
          effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their
          cell phones.
          They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
          PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
          TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain
          from the back of the truck.
          He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes
          the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.

                         EAGER TOWNIE
          This'll do it.
          He yells to the driver.

          EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          Okay, let 'er rip!
          The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then
          STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear
          of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off
          and go flying.
          People dive out of the way.
          The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"
          LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party
          continuing. They don't notice as --

          ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM
          An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in
          a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering
          below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the
          crater.
          He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object
          which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He
          pulls out a phone.

          60 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 60

          In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks
          around for a t-shirt.
          Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
          his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build,
          rippling biceps.

                         DARCY
          You know, for a crazy homeless guy,
          he's pretty cut.
          Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a
          t-shirt.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Hey, sorry I tased you!
          Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
          equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a
          stop to it.

                         JANE
          Excuse me... excuse me!
          She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
          t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads:
          "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE". Thor looks at it,
          puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.

          My ex.
          Thor stares at her a beat.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          They're the only clothes I had
          that'll fit you. Sorry.

                         THOR
          They will suffice.
          Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
          the wall.

                         JANE
          You're welcome. Now tell me...
          Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to
          his form in the Bifrost photo.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What were you doing, in that?
          He glances at it, dismissive.

                         THOR
          What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
          Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
          Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor
          moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within
          the book, curious.

                         SELVIG
          (amused, skeptical)
          The Bifrost...
          Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close
          to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the
          book.

                         JANE
          What exactly is the Bifrost?

                         THOR

                         (IGNORING HER)

          Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.

          61 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61

          Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin
          lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the
          space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The
          walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting
          him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
          Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks
          softly to him.

                         FRIGGA
          I asked him to be honest with you
          from the beginning. There should
          be no secrets in a family.

                         LOKI
          So why did he lie?

                         FRIGGA
          He kept the truth from you so that
          you would never feel different.
          You are in every way our son, Loki,
          and we your family. You must know
          that.
          Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)

                         (RE: ODIN)
          You can speak to him. He can see
          and hear us, even now.

                         LOKI
          How long will it last?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.

                         FRIGGA
          I don't know. This time is
          different. We were unprepared.

                         LOKI
          I never get used to seeing him like
          this. The most powerful being in
          the Nine Realms lying helpless
          until his body is restored.

                         FRIGGA
          But he's put it off for so long
          now, I fear...
          Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
          eyes.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          You're a good son.
          Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
          really feels.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          We mustn't lose hope that your
          father will return to us. And your
          brother.
          Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

                         LOKI
          What hope is there for Thor?

                         FRIGGA
          There's always a purpose to
          everything your father does. Thor
          may yet find a way home.
          Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
          the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
          hurriedly approaching.

          THE EINHERJAR GUARD
          Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
          the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
          baffled.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor is banished. The line of
          succession falls to you. Until he
          awakens, Asgard is yours.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A.
          The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
          EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels
          before Loki, offers the spear to him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Make your father proud.
          Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the
          feel of it in his hand.

          62 INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62

          Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local
          diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a
          huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates --
          pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
          Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

                         JANE
          Now tell us exactly what happened
          to you last night.
          Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
          flustered, looks away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Maybe start with how you got inside
          that cloud.

                         DARCY
          And how you could eat an entire box
          of Pop-Tarts and still be this
          hungry.
          Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
          coffee.

                         THOR
          (re: coffee mug)
          This drink. I like it.

                         DARCY
          (to Thor, re: coffee)
          Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
          Isabela makes the best coffee in
          town.
          Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.

                         THOR

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Another!
          ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor
          from behind the counter.

                         JANE
          Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Yo voy a pagar la taza.
          Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in
          Spanish.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54A.

                         ISABELA

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Did you see that? The first time
          she brings a man in here, and he's
          a lunatic!

                         JANE
          (to Thor, re: mug)
          What was that?
          He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.

                         THOR
          It was delicious. I want another.

                         JANE
          Then you should just say so!

                         THOR
          I just did.

                         JANE
          I mean ask for it. Nicely.

                         THOR
          I meant no disrespect.

                         JANE
          All right, then no more smashing,
          deal?

                         THOR
          You have my word.

                         JANE
          Good.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55.
          A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at
          the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them
          is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)

                         ISABELA
          Morning, Pete. Jake.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          The usual, please, Izzy.
          Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          You missed all the excitement out
          at the crater.

                         ISABELA
          What crater?
          Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
          Townies with interest.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          They're saying some kind of
          satellite crashed in the desert.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          We were having a good time with it
          till the Feds showed up, chased us
          out.

                         JANE
          (to the Townies)
          Excuse me, did you say there was a
          satellite crash?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          Yep. They said it was radioactive.
          And I had my hands all over it.

                         (REALIZING)
          I'm probably sterile now.
          Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of
          pancakes. Darcy is amazed by the sight.

                         DARCY
          Oh my God, this is going on
          Facebook.
          Darcy whips out her cellphone.

          DARCY (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Smile!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A.
          Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his
          massive stack of food.

                         SELVIG
          (to the Townies)
          What did the satellite look like?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          I don't know nothing about
          satellites. But it was heavy.
          Real heavy. Nobody could lift it.
          This gets Thor's attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 56.
          Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake,
          and pulls the Townie around to face him.

                         THOR
          Where?!

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          About twelve miles east of here.
          Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of
          the diner.

                         PETE
          I wouldn't bother! Looked like the
          whole Army was coming in when we
          left!

          63 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 63

          Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.

                         JANE
          Where are you going?

                         THOR
          Twelve miles east of here.
          He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
          with him.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          To get what belongs to me.

                         JANE
          So now you own a satellite?

                         THOR
          It's not what they say it is.

                         JANE
          Whatever it is, the government
          seems to think it's theirs. You
          intend to just walk in there and
          take it?

                         THOR
          Yes.
          He stops walking.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          If you take me there now, I'll tell
          you everything you wish to know.

                         JANE
          Everything?

                         THOR
          All the answers you seek will be
          yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
          Darcy looks to the others.

                         DARCY
          "Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?"
          Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,

                         WHEN:

                         SELVIG
          Jane.
          He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much
          care for him.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JANE)
          Please don't do this.

                         JANE
          You know what we saw last night.
          This can't be a coincidence. I
          want to know what's in that crater.

                         SELVIG
          I'm not talking about the crater.
          I'm talking about him.

                         JANE
          He's promised us answers.

                         SELVIG
          He's delusional! Listen to what
          he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost."
          "Mjolnir." These are the stories I
          grew up with as a child!

                         JANE
          I'd just be driving him out there,
          that's all.

                         SELVIG
          It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58.
          After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and
          Darcy.

                         JANE
          I'm sorry. I can't take you.

                         THOR
          I understand. Then this is where
          we say goodbye.
          He takes her hand and kisses it.

                         JANE
          That's... thank you.
          Thor bows slightly to each of them.

                         THOR
          Jane Foster... Erik Selvig...
          Darcy. Farewell.
          He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.

                         SELVIG
          Now... let's get back to the lab.
          We have work to do.
          Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor
          as he walks away down the street.

          64 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 64

          Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne
          Room.

          65 INT. THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 65

          Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors
          Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59.

                         SIF
          Allfather, we must speak with you

                         URGENTLY--
          But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --

                         LOKI
          Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his
          horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand.
          Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What is this?

                         LOKI
          My friends... you haven't heard? I
          am now Ruler of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Where is Odin?

                         LOKI
          Father's fallen into the Odinsleep.
          My mother fears he may never awaken
          again.

                         SIF
          We would speak with her.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          She has refused to leave my
          father's bedside. You can bring
          your "urgent" matter to me, your
          King.
          Sif covers quickly.

                         SIF
          We would ask you to end Thor's
          banishment.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60.

                         LOKI
          My first command can not be to undo
          the Allfather's last. We're on the
          brink of war with Jotunheim. Our
          people must have a sense of
          continuity in order to feel safe in
          these difficult times.
          Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of
          this.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          All of us must stand together, for
          the good of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Of course.
          Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki
          stares after them.

          66 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 66

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by
          Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped
          by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices,
          partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine
          from her lab.

                         JANE
          Hey! That's my stuff!

          66A EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 66A

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government
          vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the
          lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all
          the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away.
          Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with
          scientific instruments and documents.

                         JANE
          What the hell is going on here?!
          The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.

                         COULSON
          Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

          SHIELD.
          Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60A.

                         JANE
          I don't care who you work for, you
          can't do this!

                         SELVIG
          Jane. This is more serious than
          you realize. Let it go.

                         JANE
          Let it go?! This is my life!

                         COULSON
          We're here investigating a security
          threat. We need to appropriate
          your equipment and all your
          atmospheric data.

                         JANE
          By "appropriate" you mean "steal?"
          Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.

                         COULSON
          This should more than compensate
          you for your trouble.
          She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.

                         JANE
          I can't just pick up replacements
          from RadioShack! I made most of
          that equipment myself!

                         COULSON
          Then I'm sure you can do it again.

                         JANE
          And I'm sure I can sue you for
          violating my constitutional rights!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61.

                         COULSON
          We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.
          He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is
          fully herself, fueled by outrage.

                         JANE
          So are we! We're on the verge of

                         UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
          extraordinary.
          Jane holds up her notebook.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Everything I know about this
          phenomenon is in this lab and in
          this book, and no one has the right
          to take it from me.
          Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the
          notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's
          carrying. Jane is stunned.

                         COULSON
          Thank you for your cooperation.
          He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.

          67 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 67

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now-
          empty space.

                         JANE
          Years of research, gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62.

                         DARCY
          They even took my iPod.

                         SELVIG
          And your back-ups?

                         JANE
          Look around! They took our back-
          ups. They took the back-ups of our
          back-ups.

                         DARCY
          I just downloaded, like, thirty
          songs on there.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          Will you please stop talking about
          your iPod?!

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Who are these people?

                         SELVIG
          No one knows much about them. But
          I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in
          gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up,
          and he was never heard from again.

                         JANE
          I'm not going to let them do this.
          I'm getting everything back.

                         SELVIG
          Please, let me contact one of my
          colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some
          dealings with these people. I'll e-
          mail him and see if he can help.

                         DARCY
          They took your laptop, too.
          Annoyed, Selvig thinks.

          67A EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 67A

          Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the
          town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, "FREE

          INTERNET."

                         SELVIG
          I'll just be a minute.
          He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street
          and sees something that intrigues her.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62A.

          68 INT. PET STORE - DAY 68

          Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.

                         THOR
          I need a horse.

          PET STORE CLERK
          Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just
          dogs, cats, birds.

                         THOR
          Then give me one of those, large
          enough to ride.
          The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
          Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door.
          Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63.

                         JANE
          You still want a lift?

          68A INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 68A

          It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book --
          "THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS" -- to a group of kids.

                         LIBRARIAN

                         (READING)
          "And though they're large, giants
          can be quiet. You have to listen
          carefully for the sound of their
          footsteps -- because they may be
          closer than you think."
          Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his
          e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with
          interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid
          pleasantly.

          LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
          Joshua, come sit down. It's story
          time.
          The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks
          over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

          "MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD."
          He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on
          Scandinavian Mythology.
          It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to
          earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and
          THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group
          of VIKINGS kneel reverently.
          He eyes the illustration, pondering.

                         69 OMITTED 69

          70 EXT. DESERT - DUSK 70

          Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged
          terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky.

          71 INT. PINZGAUER - DUSK 71

          Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as
          Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A.

                         JANE
          I've never done anything like this
          before! Have you ever done
          anything like this before?
          Thor looks amused by her excitement.

                         THOR
          Many times. You're brave to do it.

                         JANE
          They just stole my entire life's
          work. I really don't have anything
          left to lose.

                         THOR
          But you're clever. Far more clever
          than anyone else in this Realm.

                         JANE
          "This Realm?" Why do you talk like
          that?

                         THOR
          You think me strange?
          Jane laughs, catches herself.

                         JANE
          Yeah. Just a little.

                         THOR
          Good strange or bad strange?

                         JANE
          I'm not quite sure yet.
          She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his
          gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly
          turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Who are you? Really?

                         THOR
          You'll see soon enough.

                         JANE
          You promised me answers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B.
          Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.

                         THOR
          What you seek -- it's a bridge.

                         JANE
          A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge?

                         THOR
          More like a rainbow bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64.
          A beat.

                          JANE
          God, I hope you're not crazy.

          71A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A

          As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside,
          revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move
          closer, we see the glow comes from --

          A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE
          Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers,
          barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence
          that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the
          complex.
          Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a
          translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the
          crater.
          Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
          Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
          Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS
          work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the
          center of it all -- Mjolnir.

          72 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72

          Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through
          binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.

                         JANE
          That isn't a satellite crash. They
          would have hauled the wreckage
          away, not built a city around it.
          Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.

                         THOR
          You're going to need this.

                         JANE
          Why?--
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and
          takes his jacket.

                         THOR
          Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I
          will return what they stole from
          you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A.
          He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his
          request.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Deal?

                         JANE
          No! Look what's down there! You
          can't just walk in, grab our stuff,
          and walk out!

                         THOR
          No.
          Jane looks relieved.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'm going to fly out.
          Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
          The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65.

                         JANE
          Wait...
          But Thor is already headed towards the crater.

          72A EXT. SHIELD BASE / INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE STRUCTURE 72A

          A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN
          holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give
          off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky
          above.

                         CUT TO:

          73 AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 73
          It's fuzzy, doesn't show much. We widen to see we are:

          74 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM 74

          A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors
          security. AGENT SITWELL, humorless, just this side of
          junior, looks on, none-too-pleased.

          Feed from the keyhole. Can barely
          penetrate the cloud cover.
          The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with
          static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a
          terrain map.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Tech's barely working as it is,
          with all the interference that
          thing's giving off.
          He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hey, we've got a commercial
          aircraft coming in right over us,
          Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.

                         SITWELL
          Reroute it, like all the others.

                         TECHIE
          Right. Can I get the passengers
          some free drinks for the trouble?
          Sitwell glares at him.

                         (SHRUGS)
          It'd be a nice gesture.
          The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something
          on another screen, holds up a hand.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hold a sec... we got something
          outside the fence, west side...
          He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a
          THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.

                         SITWELL
          (into a radio)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.

          74A EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 74A

          A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a
          jeep to investigate.

          74B EXT. SHIELD SECURITY ROOM 74B

          Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his
          attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is
          coming from the hammer containment area.

          75 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - FENCE - MOMENTS LATER 75

          The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a
          flashlight, see nothing unusual.

                         AGENT JACKSON

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Looks like we're good here. Must
          have been another coyote.
          Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been
          bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66.
          Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING
          illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a
          large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of
          the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.

                         AGENT DELANCEY
          Jackson?
          The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver
          across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson
          slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a
          shotgun at Thor.
          Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and
          thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
          Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.

          75A INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 75A

          Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.

                         SITWELL

                         (INTO RADIO)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- report.

          76 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - MOMENTS LATER 76

          Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across
          the base.
          Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the
          unconscious DeLancey and Jackson. He quickly calls into his
          radio.

                         SHIELD AGENT
          Agents down! We've got a perimeter
          breach!

          77 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 77

          The security monitors SQUELCH with static and interference.
          Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz. Sitwell and
          the Techie watch the monitors warily.
          On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir
          starts to crackle with energy.

                         SITWELL
          (to the Techie)
          Get Coulson.
          Sitwell punches an alarm.

          As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and
          SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life.

          78A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A

          A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the
          ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight.
          She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's
          recorded message.

          SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
          You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
          Please leave me a message.
          His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.

                         JANE
          Erik, okay, first of all, don't
          worry. I'm perfectly fine, really.
          More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          But if you don't hear from me
          again, you might want to come out
          to the crater site and look for me.
          I kind of did what you said I
          shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye.
          She hangs up.

          79 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 79

          Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches
          across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the
          lit up site uneasily.

          80 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80

          A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
          the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
          As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
          rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
          ground.
          Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the
          fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
          more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
          cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
          Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
          entrance tube to the center of the site.
          A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
          see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
          right on him.
          Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
          raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
          He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
          catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
          hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
          the ATV's spotlight.
          Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
          the wheel to protect himself.
          The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
          entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
          Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
          the site entrance.

          80A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A

          The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches
          the crater lip.
          The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
          straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
          inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
          tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
          The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
          it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

           Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied
           aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert.
           Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.

          Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain
          begins to fall. He eyes the damage of the ATV crash.
          He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour.

          82C EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TUBE 82C

          As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor
          races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads
          inside.

          82D INT. ENTRANCE TUBE 82D

          Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS
          round the corner.
          Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He
          hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
          ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
          backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
          Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
          Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through
          the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to
          tunnels to find a way towards it.

          82E EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 82E

          Coulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the
          Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor.
          Coulson activates his radio.

          As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him,
          on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to
          the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him.
          Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him
          into the approaching Agents, scattering them.
          Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents
          give chase.

          nowhere to hide. A digital read-out gives information on the
          distance to the target. He locks in on Thor, who's inside
          the plastic tubing, emerging from the junction box and
          heading towards the cube structure.

          Hello, handsome.

          83A INT. TUNNEL 83A

          Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.
          Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching --
          whatever it takes to keep moving.
          As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction
          box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.
          He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the
          middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a
          fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him
          reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see --

          A HUGE SHIELD AGENT
          The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer
          in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.

                         THOR
           You're big.
          Thor grins.

          Coulson hurries through the tunnel, ready to give the word to
          Barton, when he stops short. He sees what looks like an
          electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead,
          directly above the crater... and the hammer.

          84 EXT. CRATER 84

          Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.
          Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor
          sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking
          his view.
          Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward,
          whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing
          the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as
          Thor's momentum carries him past.
          Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge
          Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down
          at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into
          the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain,
          defeated.
          Thor races back towards the structure.

          From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the
          structure.
          He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
          His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging
          around it.
          Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,
          one story up.

          As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow
          brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The
          crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,
          his interest piqued.
          Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane
          bucket comes into view.

          Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle
          site, locked on the back of Thor's head -- his finger on the
          trigger.

          84J INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84J

          Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power. He reaches
          out to it confidently.
          Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind
          him. He motions for them to hold their positions, then

          Barton stands ready to take Thor down. His finger starts to
          squeeze the trigger.

          COULSON (V.O., ON RADIO)
          ...hold your fire.
          Barton releases the trigger, pulls up.

          84L INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84L

          Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand
          around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the
          hammer doesn't move.
          Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail
          -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all
          his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm
          and lightning above him.
          Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing
          RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.
          But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his
          knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing
          runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.
          Coulson looks on, disappointed.
          SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
          Coulson activates his radio.

                         COULSON
          Ground units, move in. Show's
          over.
          As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or
          care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the
          rain -- a man broken, lost.
          From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment
          room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue
          to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive
          damage Thor's done to it during the melee.

          86 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 86

          Jane lowers her binoculars, sensing things have gone from bad
          to worse.
          She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him.
          Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears
          the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the
          glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her.
          With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.

          Heimdall stands at his post, watching the scene. He lowers
          his head.

          88 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 88

          Jane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab.
          Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library,
          looks through it.

                         JANE
          I can't just leave him there.

          Why not?

                          JANE
          You didn't see what happened.
          Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.

                         DARCY
          Hey! Myeu-muh!
          Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig
          knowingly.

                         JANE

                         (RE: BOOK)
          Where did you find this?
          Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.

                         SELVIG
          In the children's section. I
          wanted to show you how ridiculous
          his story was.
          Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.

                         JANE
          Aren't you the one who's always
          told me to chase down all leads,
          all possibilities?

                         SELVIG
          I was talking about science, not
          magic!

                         JANE
          Magic's just science we don't
          understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.

                         SELVIG
          Who wrote science fiction.

                         JANE
          The precursor of science fact.

                         SELVIG
          In some cases.

                         JANE
          If that's really an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge out there, then there's
          something on the other side.

          through it before.

                         SELVIG
          Jane...

                         DARCY
          A primitive culture like the
          Vikings might have worshipped them
          as deities.
          They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly
          insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her,
          grateful for the support.

                         JANE
          Yes! Exactly! Thank you!
          Darcy beams.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, if you do this, you'll find
          yourself in a situation that I
          won't be able to get you out of
          this time.

                         DARCY
          I'll help you.
          Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no
          stopping her. He sighs.

          89 INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 89

          Thor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed
          behind him. Coulson stands across from him.

                         COULSON
          It's not easy to do what you did.
          You made us all look like a bunch
          of mall cops. That's hurtful.

                         (THEN)
          The men you so easily subdued are
          highly-trained professionals, and
          in my experience, it takes someone
          who's received similar training to
          do what you did to them. Would you
          like to tell me where you received
          your training?
          Thor sits silently.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
          Then again, you strike me more as
          the soldier of fortune type. What
          was it, South Africa?
          Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Certain groups pay well for a good
          mercenary. Especially HYDRA.
          Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Who are you?

                         THOR
          Just a man.

                         COULSON
          One way or another, we find out
          what we want to know. We're good
          at that.
          Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.

          LOKI (O.S.)
          I thought he'd never leave.
          Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed
          in 21st century attire.

                         THOR
          Loki? What are you doing here?

                         LOKI
          I had to see you.

                         THOR
          What's happened? Tell me! Is it
          Jotunheim? Let me explain to

                         FATHER--

                         LOKI
          Father is dead.
          Thor stares at him, stunned.

                         THOR
          What?

                         LOKI
          Your banishment, the threat of a
          new war, it was too much for him to
          bear.
          The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
          responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him,
          looks in his eyes, consolingly.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You mustn't blame yourself. I know
          that you loved him. I tried to
          tell him so, but he wouldn't
          listen.

           LOKI (CONT'D)

                         (THEN)
          It was cruel to put the hammer
          within your reach, knowing you
          could never lift it.
          Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The burden of the throne has fallen
          to me now.

                         THOR
          Can I come home?

                         LOKI
          The truce with Jotunheim is
          conditional upon your exile.

                         THOR
          But couldn't we find a way to--

                         LOKI
          Mother has forbidden your return.
          Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          This is goodbye, brother. I'm so
          sorry.

                         THOR
          No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you
          for coming here.

                         LOKI
          Nothing could have stopped me.
          Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fare well, brother.

                         THOR
          Good-bye.

                         COULSON
          Good-bye? I just got back.
          Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Now. Where did we leave off?

          90 EXT. CRATER - NIGHT 90

          Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around
          Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside
          the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he
          do it?
          He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it
          go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
          He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises
          from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.

          91 INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 91

          Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson.

                         SITWELL

                         (RE: THOR)
          Sir... he's got a visitor.

          92 INT. SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 92

          Coulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from
          Erik Selvig.

                         COULSON
          "Donald Blake?"

                         SELVIG
          Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of
          our team.

                         COULSON
          You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
          Selvig.

                         SELVIG
          Troubled, not dangerous. He was
          distraught when he found out that
          you'd taken all of our research.
          It was years of his life, gone! He
          got depressed, started drinking,
          and... well, you know the rest.

                         COULSON
          Uh-huh. You mind if we take a
          moment to verify his identity?

                         SELVIG
          Certainly.
          The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          You can understand how a man could
          go off like that. I mean, a big,
          faceless organization like yours,
          coming in with their jack-booted
          thugs and stealing private
          property...

                         (THEN)
          ...is how he described it.

                         COULSON
          That doesn't explain how he managed
          to tear through our security.
          Selvig shrugs.

                         SELVIG
          Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness
          nut.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A.
          On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New
          York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE". The license photo
          is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her
          cellphone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.
          The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD
          SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS." Coulson eyes the screen.
          After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          It says here he's an M.D.

                         SELVIG
          He is. That is, he was. He
          switched careers and became a
          physicist. He's quite brilliant,
          really.

                         (THEN)
          If you would just release him to
          me, I promise to keep an eye on
          him.
          Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
          an AGENT nearby.

                         COULSON
          Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig
          here.
          The Techie looks to him, surprised.

          COULSON (CONT'D)

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Make sure he stays in town for the
          next few days in case we need to
          talk to him again.
          Selvig shakes his hand.

                         SELVIG
          Thank you.

          92A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A

          Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a
          seated Thor.

                         SELVIG
          Donny, Donny, Donny! There you
          are!
          Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
          pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          It's going to be all right, my
          friend. Come on, I'm taking you
          home.

          He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.

          92B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B

          As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security
          Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the
          Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand-
          written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes
          it from the pile and pockets it.

          92C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C

          Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV
          record. A security warning over the image clearly reads
          "SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA." He knows it's been a ruse
          all along.
          He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
          Room, then follows them outside.

          93 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93

          Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor
          away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          Just keep him away from the bars.

                         SELVIG
          I will!

                         THOR

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where are we going?
          Selvig drops his cool demeanor.

                         SELVIG
          To get a drink.
          Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
          As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
          GARRETT and CALE.

                         COULSON
          Follow them.

          94 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94

          Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy
          surface of the planet.

          95 INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95

          Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of
          light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
          Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
          Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.

                         LAUFEY
          Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

                         LOKI
          I've come alone and unarmed.

                         LAUFEY
          To what end?

                         LOKI
          To make you another proposition.

                         LAUFEY

                         (REALIZING)
          So you're the one who let us into
          Asgard.

                         LOKI
          You're welcome.

                         LAUFEY
          My men are dead, and I have no
          Casket. You are a deceiver.
          Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
          calmly stands his ground.

                         LOKI
          You have no idea what I am.
          The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
          guards stare in shock. Loki grins.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Hello, Father.
          Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
          Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.

                         LAUFEY
          Ah, the bastard son. I thought
          Odin had killed you. That's what I
          would have done. He's as weak as
          you are.

                         LOKI
          No longer weak. I now rule Asgard,
          until Odin awakens. Perhaps you
          should not have so carelessly
          abandoned me.
          This gives Laufey pause.

                         LAUFEY
          Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
          I've ever made. I will hear you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.

                         LOKI
          I will conceal you and a handful of
          your soldiers, lead you into his
          chambers, and let you slay him
          where he lies. I'll keep the
          throne, and you will have the
          Casket.
          Laufey studies Loki's face.

                         LAUFEY
          Why would you do this?

                         LOKI
          When all is done, we will have a
          permanent peace between our two
          worlds. Then I, the bastard son,
          will have accomplished what Odin
          and Thor never could.

                         LAUFEY
          This is a great day for Jotunheim.
          Asgard is finally ours.

                         LOKI
          No. Asgard is mine. The rest of
          the Nine Realms will be yours, if
          you do as you're told.
          Laufey considers the proposition.

                         LAUFEY
          I accept.
          Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
          smile crosses his face.

          96 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96

          Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from
          his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.

                         HEIMDALL
          I turned my gaze upon you in
          Jotunheim, but could neither see
          nor hear you. You were shrouded
          from me, like the Frost Giants who
          entered this Realm.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps your senses have weakened
          after your many years of service.

                         HEIMDALL
          Or perhaps someone has found a way
          to hide that which he does not wish
          me to see.
          Loki sizes him up, smiles.

                         LOKI
          You have great power, Heimdall.
          Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

                         HEIMDALL
          No.

                         LOKI
          And why is that?

                         HEIMDALL
          Because he is my King, and I am
          sworn to obey him.

                         LOKI
          Exactly. Just as you're sworn to
          obey me now. Yes?
          A beat.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         LOKI
          Good. Then you will open the
          Bifrost to no one until I have
          undone what my brother has started.
          Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after
          him.

          97 INT. BAR - NIGHT 97

          Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
          The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots
          of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it.
          Thor follows his example.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.

                         SELVIG
          Seems Darcy's a terrible intern,
          but a talented hacker.

                         THOR
          Thank you for what you've done.

                         SELVIG
          Don't thank me. I only did it for 
          Jane.

                         THOR
          Are you in love with her?

                         SELVIG
          Of course not! Jane's like a
          daughter to me. Her father and I
          taught at University together. A
          good man, but he never listened.
          This registers with Thor.

                         THOR
          Neither did I.
          Selvig eyes him with interest.

                         SELVIG
          I don't know if you're really 
          delusional, and I really don't care 
          at this point. I just care about 
          her. I've seen the way she looks
          at you.

                         THOR
          I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

                         SELVIG
          Good. If that's the case, then
          I'll buy you one more drink, and 
          you'll leave town tonight. 
          A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.

                         THOR
          I had it all backwards. I had it
          all wrong.
          Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
          he's seen before.

                         SELVIG
          It's not a bad thing, finding out
          that you don't have all the
          answers. That's when you start
          asking the right questions.
          Thor takes this in.

                         THOR
          For the first time in my life, I
          have no idea what I'm supposed to
          do. 

                         SELVIG
          Anyone who's ever going to find 
          their way in this world has to
          start by admitting they don't know
          where the hell they are.
          Thor nods.

          DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
          Hey, I know you, man... 
          An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one 
          of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He
          approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          You were in the diner with that hot 
          girl.
          Thor doesn't like where this is going. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't mind her doing a little
          research on me.
          He laughs. Thor is annoyed. 

                         THOR
          I have no quarrel with you. But 
          she's a lady. You should be more 
          respectful.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.

                          DRUNK TOWNIE
           And you should shut the hell up, 
           princess.
           Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. 
           But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's 
          baiting. 

                          THOR 
           I will not fight him. 

                          DRUNK TOWNIE 
           Then it'll be easy to kick your 
           ass. 
           Selvig stands, steps between the two men.

                          SELVIG
           Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our 
           heads. 
          Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
          Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his
          glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Another drink?

          98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98

          Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
          FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
          routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
          in time with the song.

                         THOR/SELVIG

                         (SINGING)
          "The mood is good, our hearts are
          full, there's magic in the air. /
          It's all because we're here
          tonight, and haven't got a care. /
          So raise a glass, and toast to
          life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la-
          la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine
          indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a
          friend is fine indeed!"
          Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
          Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
          straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
          WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
          Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to
          walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.

          99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99

          The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn
          with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane
          lies on her bed, trying to read.
          She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to
          the door and opens it to find --

                         THOR
          Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his
          shoulder.

                         JANE
          Erik!

                         (TO THOR)
          Is he all right?

                         THOR
          He's fine. Not injured at all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A.
          As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
          Selvig GROANS.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Sorry, my friend.

                         JANE
          What happened?

                         THOR
          We drank. We fought. He made his
          ancestors proud.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.

                         JANE
          Put him on the bed.
          Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
          bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
          way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig
          awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.

                         SELVIG
          I still don't believe you're the
          God of Thunder.

                         (THEN)
          But you ought to be.
          Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to
          sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
          Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
          Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.

                         THOR
          These are your chambers?
          Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
          the mess around her.

                         JANE
          Well, it's more of a temporary
          living space, really. I don't
          usually have visitors in here.
          Actually, never...
          Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from
          him, puts it away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Can we go outside?

          100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100

          Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He
          offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set
          up, a couple chairs, some blankets.

                         JANE
          I come up here sometimes when I
          can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to
          reconcile particle data. Or when
          Darcy's driving me crazy.

                         (THEN)
          I come up here a lot, now that I
          think about it.
          Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're safe.

                         THOR
          You've been very kind. I've been
          far less grateful than you deserve.

                         JANE
          I also hit you with my car a couple
          times, so it kind of evens out.
          He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her

          NOTEBOOK.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I don't believe it...
          She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.

                         THOR
          It was all I could get back. Not
          as much as I promised. I'm sorry.

                         JANE
          No, this is good. Thank you. This
          means I don't have to start from
          scratch...
          She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a
          harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.

                         THOR
          What's wrong?

                         JANE
          SHIELD, whatever they are. They're
          never going to let this research
          see the light of day.

                         THOR
          You must do this. You must finish
          what you've started.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          Because you're right. It's taken
          so many generations for your people
          to get to this point. You're
          nearly there. You just need
          someone to show you how close you
          really are.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83.
          Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page
          which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from
          the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one
          point to another in space.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Look -- your ancestors called it
          magic. You call it science. I
          come from a place where they're one
          and the same thing.
          We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil
          as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.

                         JANE
          What is it?

                         THOR
          This is how my father explained it
          to me...

                         (THEN)
          Your world is one of the Nine
          Realms of the Cosmos, linked to
          each other by the branches of
          Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now,
          you see it every day, without
          realizing. Images glimpsed through
          -- what did you call it?...
          (checks her notebook)
          ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine
          Realms...
          They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is
          going to be a long night.

          101 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101

          Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He
          stares up at the night sky.
          She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He
          looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at
          the town beyond her.

          102 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 102

          Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands
          nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously
          as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can
          stand it no more.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84.

                         FANDRAL
          Our dearest friend banished, Loki
          on the throne, Asgard on the brink
          of war, yet you manage to consume
          four wild boar, six pheasant, a
          side of beef, and two casks of ale.
          Shame on you! Don't you care?!
          Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg
          pulls his weapon, stopping him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Do not mistake my appetite for
          apathy.

                         SIF
          Stop it, both of you! We all know
          what we have to do, we're just too
          damned afraid to do it!

                         HOGUN

                         (DECIDES)
          We must go. We must find Thor.
          Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the
          fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.

                         FANDRAL
          It's treason, Hogun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          To hell with treason, it's suicide.

                         (SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
          Now, shh! Heimdall may be
          watching! It's said he can hear--

                         FANDRAL
          Yes, yes, we know!

                         SIF
          Thor would do the same for us.
          An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          Heimdall demands your presence.
          Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We're doomed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84A.

          103 EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING 103

          Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo.

          104 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - DAY 104

          Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled
          against him. She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85.
          He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.

          105 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 105

          Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig
          emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane.
          Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:

                         SELVIG
          I need some coffee.
          The three head inside Smith Motors.

          FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET
          SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a
          small audio surveillance device towards the lab.

          105A INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 105A

          Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor
          holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She
          scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the
          table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.

                         DARCY
          Thanks.

                         THOR
          You're very welcome.
          Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
          She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their
          breakfast, looking like a little family.

           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86.

          108 EXT. MAIN STREET 108

          On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett
          and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their
          wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window
          with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link,
          turns to Cale.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          They want an update.

                         AGENT CALE
          Tell them he's eating eggs.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Scrambled or fried?
          Cale glares at him.

                         AGENT CALE

                         (INTO COMM-LINK)
          Target is eating eggs, sir.
          We'll keep you posted.

          108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA

          As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his
          hand, gets an idea.

                         THOR

                         (RE: MUG)
          May I have this?

                         DARCY
          Sure.

                         THOR
          Thank you. Excuse me a moment.
          Thor leaves.

          108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A

          In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day.
          (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop
          tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch.
          She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him
          suspiciously. He offers her a MUG.

                         THOR
          To replace the one I broke. Please
          forgive my behavior.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A.
          She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

                         ISABEL
          Okay. Thank you.

                         THOR
          If I may, I'd like to come back for
          more of your "coffee."

                         ISABEL
          Any time.
          He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and
          shrugs.

          ISABEL (CONT'D)
          She could do worse.

          109 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109

          Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the
          intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's
          controls. He glares at them accusingly.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Good Heimdall, less us explain--

                         HEIMDALL
          You would defy the commands of Loki
          our King, break every oath you have
          taken as warriors, and commit
          treason to bring Thor back?
          The four exchange nervous glances.

                         SIF
          Yes, but--

                         HEIMDALL
          Good.
          The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?

                         VOLSTAGG
          So you'll help us?

                         HEIMDALL
          I am bound by honor to our King. I
          cannot open the Bifrost to you.
          With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
          The others exchange puzzled looks.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B.

                         FANDRAL
          Complicated fellow, isn't he?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Now what do we do?
          Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.

                         SIF
          Look!
          The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the
          control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally.
          Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.

          110 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 110

          Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite
          footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.

                         COULSON
          What the hell was that?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87.

                         TECHIE
          I don't know, sir. We got massive
          energy readings out of nowhere,
          then they just disappeared.
          Fifteen miles due northwest.

                         COULSON
          Let's go take a look.

          111 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111

          Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and
          Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They
          clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the
          hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes
          cover the desert sand around them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          He must have landed nearby. It's
          time to put our tracking skills to
          work. Spread out. Check the sand
          for indentations of his boot
          prints.

                         FANDRAL
          The winds would have blown them
          away by now. We should look for
          signs of a campfire.

                         SIF
          Or we could just start there.
          She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the
          distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to
          Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg
          and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.

                         FANDRAL
          It's worth a look, I suppose.
          The party tromps towards the town.

          112 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112

           Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as
           they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.

          113 EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113

           A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He
           runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side 
           of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth 
           dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car 
           up with one hand.

           Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He 
           hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair. 

                          VOLSTAGG 
           There you go, lad!
           The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head 
          off.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Is it just me, or does Earth look a
          little different to you?

          It has been a thousand years...

          Things change so fast here. You
          leave for a millennium, and it's
          like the whole neighborhood's gone.
          Volstagg sniffs, smells something.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Perhaps we should split up.

          Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking
          down the street.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Is there a Renaissance Faire in
          town?

                         AGENT CALE
          Call it in.
          But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes
          their heads together. They're out.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Never cared for spies.
          He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the
          ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a
          bite. He likes what he tastes.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Exquisite.

          115 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 115

          Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an
          Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          My liege, the Warriors Three and
          the Lady Sif have gone missing.
          Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.

          116 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116

          Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.

                         HEIMDALL
          Tell me, Loki, how did you get the
          Jotuns into Asgard?

                         LOKI
          You think the Bifrost is the only
          way in and out of the Realm? There
          are secret paths between worlds to
          which even you with all your gifts
          are blind. But I have need of them
          no longer, now that I am King.

                         (THEN)
          And I say, for your act of treason,
          you are relieved of your duties as
          Gatekeeper. And you are no longer
          a citizen of Asgard.

                         HEIMDALL
          Then I need no longer obey you.
          Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
          Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of
          something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it
          quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --

          THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.
          The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki
          opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
          From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of
          the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
          SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
          towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
          still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
          Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his
          massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,
          just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of
          relief and steps past him.

          117 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117

          Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and
          opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER
          appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns
          its head toward its King.

                         LOKI
          Ensure my brother does not return.

          118 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 118

           Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying
           up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and
          utensils away.
          The door opens.

           VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
           Found you!
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --

          SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE
          Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying
          dishes in mortal clothing.
          Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor.

          Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the
          room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with
          wonder.

                         SELVIG

          the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and
          I, Volstagg the Svelte?
          Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Well, perhaps I've put on a little
          more muscle since I was here last.

                         JANE 
          That would have been a thousand

          Exactly! Those lovely herring 
          people. They worshipped us! 
          Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.

                         THOR
          My friends, I've never been happier 
          to see anyone. But you should not
          have come.

                         FANDRAL
          We're here to take you home.
          Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.

                         THOR
          You know I can't. My father is 
          dead because of me. I must remain
          in exile.
          The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

                         SIF
          Thor... your father still lives.
          Thor reacts to the revelation.

          A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few
          SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings.
          Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an
          Agent.

          Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost
          storm ROARS in the sky above.
          Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their
          vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in
          strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and
          the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the
          desert floor.
          Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.

          Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.

          From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at
          the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it
          moves towards them.

                         SHIELD AGENT

                         (RE: DESTROYER)
          Is that one of Stark's?

          doesn't tell me anything.

          Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the
          Destroyer.

          Hello! You're using unregistered
          weapons technology. Please
          identify yourself.
          We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up
          inside.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Incoming!
          As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy
          from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return
          fire.

          123 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 123

          Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in
          the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as
          Thor turns to Jane.

                         THOR
          Leave this town now. Get yourself
          and your friends to safety.

          I'm still a warrior, and I will
          fight by your side.

                         VOLSTAGG

          battle to us.
          Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the
          oncoming threat.

                         THOR

                         (TO SIF)
          You're right.
          Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Help me clear the streets. I'll
          let none of these people die this
          day.
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of
          Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head
          across town, towards the Destroyer.

          Laufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and
          step onto the platform. Loki is waiting for them. He pulls
          Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel. The giant
          apparatus slows to a stop.

          A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in
          front of it. Then we see it --

                         THE DESTROYER
          Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from
          within it.
          It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting

          Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as

          on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the

          The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg
          SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually
          work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It
          lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs
          apologetically.
          The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
          smashing into them, when --

          Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and
          plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
          The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its
          faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a
          brief moment of hope.
          But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
          again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
          Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
          degrees to face its attackers.
          The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
          of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
          rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
          staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
          Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
          unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
          in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
          free, landing in the middle of the street.

          131 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131

          Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
          time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
          A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
          and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
          they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
          impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

                         JANE
          Erik!
          She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going
          into shock.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO JANE)
          Go! Leave me!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98.
          Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
          stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
          for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
          pouch and races back.
          He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
          useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.

                         THOR
          Come on... give me one!
          Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
          intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
          the end of the iron rod.

                         JANE
          What are you doing? What is that?
          As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
          Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
          piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
          reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
          completely.
          Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
          lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
          reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
          flesh.

                         SELVIG
          (to Jane, re: Thor)
          I'm really starting to like him.
          Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.

          132 EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132

          Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on
          the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.

                         THOR
          Go, while you can!

                         SIF
          But the others...

                         THOR
          You can't help them now. Your job
          is to survive.
          She struggles to sit up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.

                         SIF
          No! I will die a warrior's death.
          Stories will be told of this day--
          He gently takes her shield from her.

                         THOR
          Live and tell those stories
          yourself.
          At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
          with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
          towards them.
          Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
          safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
          and Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)

                         (RE: VOLSTAGG)
          Get him out of here!

                         FANDRAL
          No. We can still fight!

                         THOR
          But not win. Move Volstagg, or
          he'll die!
          Thor looks at them, grins.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, my friends. I have a
          plan.
          The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
          drag him away from the battlefield.
          After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
          tosses Sif's shield aside.
          He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
          defenseless.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Brother... for whatever I have done
          to wrong you, whatever I have done
          to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
          But these people have done nothing
          to you. They are innocents.
          He continues towards the Destroyer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Take my life, and know I will never
          return to Asgard.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99.
          Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
          The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
          swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
          of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
          Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
          Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
          The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
          a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to
          Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, no!
          He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead,
          watching the scene --

          133 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 133

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep.
          A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100.

          134 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134

          Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
          Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
          him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
          unleash its fiery blast.

          135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135

          Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,
          burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the
          hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
          vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
          Clouds form in the sky above.
          Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
          straight up into the air like a rocket.

          136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136

          The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --

          KRAKAKABOOM!
          A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
          colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is
          massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust
          enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --

                         JANE
          Oh. My. God.

          THE MIGHTY THOR
          Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
          the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir
          down onto the ground.

          KRAKABOOM!
          Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings
          Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
          Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
          God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
          force winds.
          Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The
          Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.
          It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
          locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
          straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
          Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
          overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
          Destroyer.
          Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
          The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
          within him, firing out of all his openings.
          Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
          heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
          Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
          lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
          pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
          skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
          Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
          A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

                         COULSON
          Donald... I don't think you've been
          completely honest with me.

          137 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 137

          Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in
          the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS.
          Darcy turns to Volstagg.

                         DARCY
          So, how can you speak our language?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Your language? Ha! Silly girl,
          you're speaking ours.
          Thor calls up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!

          138 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 138

          Heimdall stands frozen.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102.

          139 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 139

          Thor looks to the others with concern.

                         THOR
          He would open it if he could. I
          fear the worst.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Then we're trapped here forever.

                         FANDRAL
          Then I suppose we'd best start
          settling into our new lives.
          He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Are all earth maidens as fair as
          you?
          Darcy enjoys the attention.

                         DARCY
          No.
          Thor shouts back up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall!

          140 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 140

          From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
          Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters
          all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With
          a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
          Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the
          Observatory.

          141 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 141

          The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD
          Agent's machine gun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Primitive. Good enough for hunting
          small game, I suppose.
          Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor
          grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102A.

                         FANDRAL
          Sorry, my love. These things
          happen.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103.
          He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to
          Coulson.

                         THOR
          Know this, son of Coul. You and I,
          we fight for the same cause -- the
          protection of this world. From
          this day forward, count me as your
          ally.

                         (THEN)
          If you return the items you have
          stolen from Jane Foster.

                         COULSON
          Not stolen. Borrowed.
          Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          You'll get your equipment back.
          You're going to need it to continue
          your research... which, after
          today's events, SHIELD would like
          to fully sponsor. If that's all
          right with you.
          Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at
          him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him
          again.

                         THOR
          Whatever fate lies before me, you
          are part of it.
          He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and
          the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.

          142 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 142

          The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall
          slumped over his controls.

                         THOR
          (to the others)
          Get him to the healing room! Leave
          my brother to me.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104.
          Thor bolts out the door.

          143 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 143

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears
          the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga
          grabs a sword.
          A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard,
          cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily.
          Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
          Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.

          144 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 144

          Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the
          palace.

          145 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 145

          The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing
          the moment.
          He forms an ICE BLADE.

          146 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 146

          Thor races through the entrance to the palace.

          147 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 147

          Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.

                         LAUFEY
          It's said you can still see and
          hear what transpires around you,
          even in this state. I hope it's
          true, so that you may know your
          death came by the hand of Laufey.
          He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --

          A BLAST OF ENERGY
          Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground,
          we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding
          Gungnir.

                         LOKI
          And your death came by the son of
          Odin.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A.
          Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for
          Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall,
          taking him out.

          The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly,
          his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,

                         REVEALING --

                         FRIGGA
          Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She
          looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I swear to you, mother, they will
          pay for what they've done today. I
          will end the Jotun threat, now and
          forever!
          He looks to Odin.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          And I will make you proud.
          Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
          in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
          and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
          respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor!
          She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
          on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.

                         LOKI
          Found its way back to you, did it?

                         THOR
          No thanks to you.
          Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.

                         FRIGGA
          What?

                         THOR
          Why don't you tell her? How you
          sent the Destroyer to kill our
          friends? To kill me?
          Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.

                         LOKI
          It must have been enforcing
          Father's last command.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.

                         THOR
          You're a talented liar, brother.
          Always have been.

                         LOKI

                         (SMILES)
          It's good to have you back.

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
          destroy Jotunheim.
          Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
          Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber
          walls, into...

          148 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - CORRIDOR 148

          Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the
          opposite side of the corridor, to...

          149 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 149

          Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting
          pools below.

          150 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 150

          Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then
          quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory.

          151 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 151

          Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret
          spins, points.

          152 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 152

          Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees
          the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He
          looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.

                         THOR
          Jotunheim...

          153 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 153

          Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost
          energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
          He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway.

          154 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 154

          Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the
          Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A.
          He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an
          enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.

                         LOKI
          All these years, and no one's ever
          dared to use it as a weapon.
          Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through
          it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki
          fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,
          blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the
          ice as Thor staggers to his feet.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You can't stop it. The Bifrost
          will build until it rips Jotunheim
          apart.

                         THOR
          Why have you done this?

                         LOKI
          To do what Father never could. To
          destroy their kind forever. When
          he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of
          what I've done.

                         THOR
          He won't! You can't kill an entire
          race!

                         LOKI
          What is this newfound love for the
          Frost Giants? You, who would have
          killed them all with your bare
          hands.

                         THOR
          I've changed.

                         LOKI
          So have I.
          Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fight me.
          He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his
          hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow,
          but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back
          towards the frozen controls.
          Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which
          immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.

                         THOR
          Is the throne really worth what
          you've done? What you would
          become?

                         LOKI
          I never wanted the throne. I only
          wanted to be your equal. Now fight
          me!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108.
          With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
          Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.

                         THOR
          I will not fight you, brother.

                         LOKI
          I am not your brother. I never
          was.

                         THOR
          Loki, this is madness...
          Loki grins.

                         LOKI
          Is it?
          He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to
          his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          What happened to you on earth that
          turned you so soft? Don't tell me
          it was a woman.
          Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It was. Perhaps when we're
          finished here I'll pay her a little
          visit myself.
          That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and
          their weapons collide.
          The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and
          jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          155 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 155

          It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of
          the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart.
          JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking
          ice.

          156 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 156

           Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the
           hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around
          it.

                          SELVIG
          Jane?

          157 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
          Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
          hand.
          The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
          Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
          back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
          powerful.
          Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
          towards the Bifrost.

                         LOKI
          If you care so much for the Jotuns,
          then die with them.
          The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
          drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
          concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
          towards the Bifrost.
          MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
          The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
          blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
          brother.

          158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158

          Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
          land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
          to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.

                         LOKI
          Thor! Help me!
          Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
          up at him desperately.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Please...
          Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
          brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
          then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
          around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
          Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
          him across the bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.
          Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
          him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
          It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
          to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
          Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
          never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
          Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

                         LOKIS
          I was always more clever than you.

                         THOR
          Yet still not clever enough.
          With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
          summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
          channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
          Lokis.
          All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
          Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
          knocked from his grasp.
          Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
          back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
          away.
          Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
          confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
          his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
          pinned to the ground.
          Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
          towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
          do.
          Loki watches him smugly.

                         LOKI
          Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
          With all your strength, what good
          does it do you now?
          Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
          happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
          VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
          feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
          He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
          Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
          hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
          Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
          thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
          channels the power of the storm into it, then --
          He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
          massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
          the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
          where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Stop! What are you doing?!
          Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
          The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
          out from it. Loki thinks fast.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
          never see her again!
          Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
          through the back.

                         THOR
          Forgive me.
          Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
          Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
          sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
          KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
          out of it.
          Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
          the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
          Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
          The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
          As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
          Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
          towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
          from the broken Bridge.
          They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
          force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
          by the debris, when --

          A POWERFUL HAND
          Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
          as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

                         SEE --

          Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
          Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
          Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
          approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
          disappointment and regret.
          Loki lets go.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          No!
          But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
          falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
          him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
          Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
          Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
          into his father's arms.

                         ODIN
          It is over.

          The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
          in all directions.
          Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
          Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
          significance of what's just happened.

                         JANE
          It's gone.

          160 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160

          A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
          sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
          Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
          their battle with the Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG
          ...and then, with a mighty bellow,
          I flew at the great metal beast and
          laid it low...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.

                         FANDRAL
          Is that another way of saying you
          fell on your huge a--

                         VOLSTAGG
          As a matter of fact, falling down
          was a tactic. Lulling the
          Destroyer into a false sense of
          security!

                         FANDRAL
          Well, I was the one who had to drag
          your enormous carcass off the
          battlefield. That makes me the
          real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
          Hogun points to Volstagg.

                         HOGUN
          Big stomach.
          (points to Fandral)
          Big mouth.
          The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
          look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
          smile.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, how about that? A smile!
          I'd say that calls for another
          drink!
          They laugh and raise another round.
          Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
          sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
          Frigga, bows her head.

                         SIF
          My Queen. I am so sorry for your
          loss.
          Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.

                         FRIGGA
          Thank you, Sif.
          She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
          him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          How is he?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.

                         SIF
          He mourns for his brother. And he
          misses her. The mortal.
          Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
          Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.

                         FRIGGA
          He will need his friends now more
          than ever.

                         SIF
          I will always be at his side.
          Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.

          161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161

          Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
          walks up behind him.

                         ODIN
          You'll be a wise King.

                         THOR
          There will never be a wiser king
          than you. Or a better father.

                         (THEN)
          I have much to learn. I know that
          now. But some day, perhaps, I will
          make you proud.

                         ODIN
          You've already made me proud.
          Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.

          162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162

          Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
          energy, drifting off into space.
          Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
          Thor stares out at the stellar void.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.

                         THOR
          Can you see her?
          Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         THOR
          How is she?

          163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163

          Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
          ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
          away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
          inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
          that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
          facility, abuzz with activity.
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
          the-art equipment.
          Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
          SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
          windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
          roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
          hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
          before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES" logo.
          From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.

                         DARCY
          Here you go.

                         JANE
          Thanks.
          Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.

                         DARCY
          He would have come back if he
          could.

                         JANE
          I know. But if he can't get here
          on his own...
          Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D
          HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,
          bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --
          YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.

                         

                         

                         

                         
"

           JANE (CONT'D)
           ...maybe we can help him find his
           way back.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY

     WIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky.

     THE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the
     distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT
     CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING.

     The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders
     APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY
     BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is
     a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby.

     Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER
     stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares
     at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag
     over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy
     turns around, we see his face for the first time.

                         TROY
               Are we shooting people, or what?

                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
               Are we shooting?

                         TROY
               That's what I'm asking you.

                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
               What's the answer?

                         TROY
               I don't know the answer. That's
               what I'm trying to find out.

     PAN TO THREE SOLDIERS 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN --

     SOLDIER #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth.
     TWO OTHER SOLDIERS put out their hands and get pieces of gum.

     PAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands with
     his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into his eye.

                         SOLDIER #3
               It looks like a grain of sand, but
               I don't know how I'm gonna get it
               out--

     CAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               If they surrender, don't shoot, if
               they don't surrender, then shoot.

     PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns
     back to the dune and runs a few yards.

     Stops and stares, raises his rifle.  He aims at the figure on
     the horizon.

     POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

     The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing,
     loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.  Slow motion RIFLE sound.

     Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck
     explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of
     Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up
     to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing.

                         SOLDIER #3 (O.S.)
               That guy just shot a towel head.

                         SOLDIER #4 (O.S.)
               Bullshit.

     YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER

     lies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away. He is
     rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other.
     He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him.

                                              SMASH CUT TO

     FANTASY - INT. HOSPITAL, TORRANCE, CAL. - DAY

     A WHITE BABY GIRL, covered in blood and placenta, is pulled
     from between the legs of Troy's WIFE, DARLENE. THE NURSE
     holds the SCREAMING BABY aloft, proud and happy.

                         VIG (V.O.)
                      (deep southern accent)
               Congratulations, you got yourself
               a rag head, my man.

     EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY (PRESENT)

     The rasping Iraqi dies.

     PAN TO CONRAD VIG, 18 or 20, wiry, intense, deep south,
     wearing Army issue glasses, out of breath.

                         VIG
               Dag.

     Troy turns, upset, murmurs "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys.

                         TROY
               "Gettin' bugged drivin' up and
               down the same old strip, gotta
               find a new place where the kids
               are hip, I get around --"

                         SOLDIER #1
               I didn't think I'd see anyone get
               shot over here.

                         VIG
               It looked like the guy's head blew
               three feet into the air --

     FANTASY SEQUENCE IN SLOW MOTION

     The Iraqi's head pops three feet into the air.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

                         SOLDIER #1
               Bullshit, that's not what happened.

                         VIG
               I said it looked like that
               happened, but then we got here and
               he was still breathing.

                         SOLDIER #2
               Oh, my God, it's just like
               'Predator,' where the guy, the
               black guy --

                         SOLDIER #3
               Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot
               off.

                         VIG
               And when it hits the ground, his
               hand keeps on firing.

     SCENE FROM 'PREDATOR'

     Carl Weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing.

     BACK TO THE SCENE.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Take my picture.

                         VIG
               Do you still want to sell pictures?

                         TROY
                      (distracted monotone)
               For twenty.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Twenty dollars, man, what's the
               meaning of life?

                         TROY
               You're lucky you got to see
               anybody shot in this war.

                         VIG
               War's been over five days, Jim,
               ain't gonna be much more of this.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Bobby, take my picture.

     He holds the camera out.

                         SOLDIER #4
               If he shot the guy, it's up to him.

                         SOLDIER #5
               It's not like he shot a fucking
               deer. It's the enemy.

                         VIG
               Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.

     Soldiers get their cash out, Troy takes it.

                         TROY
               Accept no substitute, this is the
               real thing, oh, Jesus [winces] --

                         VIG
               What's wrong?

                         TROY
               I got a really bad headache all of
               a sudden--

     SOLDIER #7 bends next to the corpse and holds his camera out
     at arm's length.

                         VIG
               No free pictures, motherfucker.

     Vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they roll
     down the sand berm.

     "I Just Want to Celebrate" by Rare Earth comes on LOUD.

     Troy walks away holding his temple in pain; SOLDIERS gather
     to stare at the dead Iraqi, getting their cameras out.

     EXT. IRAQI DESERT ROAD - AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN COMBAT GEAR

     dance on a road in the desert. "I Just Want to Celebrate"
     BLARES as the CAMERA DOLLIES THROUGH the soldiers.

     DOLLY INTO TENT TOWN, past bare chested soldiers pumping free
     weights; jogging in formation; sunbathing on big water
     storage mattresses; DOLLY OUT OF THE TENT TOWN, past a
     soldier taking a makeshift foxhole desert bath, past a dead
     Iraqi on the road, a chopper hovering in the distance, to
     MORE DANCING SOLDIERS, as music continues --

                         BILL SMITHSON (O.S.)
               Spirits are high and the music is
               boisterous as these young troops
               celebrate -- Shit. Let me try that
               again.

     DOLLY AROUND the dancing soldiers to see: hundreds of
     stripped Iraqi soldiers lying face down in undershorts.

                         BILL SMITHSON (O.S.)
               Spirits are high and the music is
               fucking motherfucking sand in my
               eye --

     PAN PAST CNN REPORTER BILL SMITHSON, 45, in white safari
     jacket over Desert Storm fatigues, cleaning his eye; nearby
     a cluster of ROWDY SOLDIERS who are mugging into the camera.

     DOLLY TO ARCHIE GATES, 55, Lieutenant Colonel, Special
     Forces, wearing sunglasses, talking to HAVICHON, a FRENCH
     Special Forces Captain on CRUTCHES with a broken leg.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Is that what you got from this
               experience? A goddamn watch?

                         HAVICHON
               Ees a great fucking watch.

     Close up: portrait of a sheik on a Rolex.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               There's 700 million in gold out
               there and you're fucking around
               with a watch?

                         HAVICHON
               Bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of
               gold, man.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               One bunker of gold and we retire
               from this horseshit, Hashy--

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Just a second. The problem, Hash,
               is how do you find it?

                         HAVICHON
               Like one sowsan bunker out sair --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair,
               Hash, how do you find Saddam's
               bullion?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Could I have some help over here,
               for Chrissakes?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               My goodness, Bill, what seems to
               be the problem?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I'm trying to do a story here and
               the fucking sand is blowing in my
               face --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You want me to stop the sand? I
               can't do anything about that.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               No, you're too busy talking about
               the fucking gold, which by the way
               makes a great story if you'd get
               me a goddamn lead on it --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I think the Saddam story goes more
               for the jugular, journalistically
               speaking, I mean, he's still here
               beating the shit out of his
               country.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Would you just be my guide and not
               my fucking producer? You're my
               guide.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               OK, go do your celebration story,
               Bill.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               You've exorcised the ghosts of
               Vietnam with a clear moral
               imperative --

                         SOLDIER #5
               Is that what we did?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Where the hell are you going?

     Archie is walking off with CATHY DAITCH a young reporter.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I'll be right back.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I don't want you helping other
               reporters, goddamn it.

                         SOLDIER #1
               We kicked ass.

                         SOLDIER #6
               We didn't get rid of fucking
               Saddam --

                         SOLDIER #8
               Which totally sucks a big dick.

                         SOLDIER #6
               Those people are getting reemed --

                         SOLDIER #7
               Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Who's getting reemed? The Shiites?

                         SOLDIER #8
               I don't know who they are, man --

                         SOLDIER #6
               We got big firepower but we ain't
               saving them --

                         SOLDIER #5
               Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait.

                         SOLDIER #1
               Weehaaaaaaa.

     Five soldiers chant Lee Greenwood's anthem, "Proud to Be An
     American" into Smithson's camera --

               gone that I worked for all my life

     INT. LARGE ARMY TENT - NIGHT

     "Proud To Be An American" BLASTS on as

     Troy, wearing a checked Arab headdress is paraded on
     shoulders. He holds up a Coke can in one hand and a Bud can
     in the other, like torches.

                         TROY
                      (screaming the song)
               And I'm proud I to be an American,
               where at least I know I'm free.
               And I won't forget the men who
               died, who gave that right to me.
               And I'd gladly stand up; next to
               you and defend her still today.
               Cause there ain't no doubt I love
               this land, God bless the U S A --

     Soldiers scream and go nuts.

     Beer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths.

     "I Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man" by Public Enemy blasts.

     WALTER WOGOMAN, 19, quiet, tall, Southern operates two
     parallel boom boxes like a DJ.

     A Soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top of
     another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee. Vig wearing
     a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a
     series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements.

     Soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at Troy. He
     whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes.

     Soldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as the
     music blasts.  Two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols
     at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal.

                         TROY
               Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

     Vig screams into Troy's face at point blank range.

                         VIG
               Rahhhhhhhhh.

                         TROY
               Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Goddamn it, where the fuck did
               this beer come from we gotta take
               more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow.

     EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY

     WIDE SHOT -  HUNDREDS OF IRAQIS walking in the desert, hands
     raised above their heads.

                         TRANSLATOR (MEGAPHONE)
               Hasnala shi aluno quibaan --

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               We will not hurt you. Lay down
               your weapons, get on the ground --

     TWO IRAQIS with bad face wounds get medical help.

     FIVE IRAQIS

     on their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as they disrobe.
     They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as he holds his M-16
     on the begging Iraqis.

                         TROY
               It's cool, no one's gonna hurt
               you --

     Vig whips out his big Thunder 5 pistol and points it in their
     faces.

                         VIG
               Did you rape and torture anybody
               in Kuwait, Abdul?

     The Iraqis wail for mercy. Troy pushes Vig's pistol away.

                         TROY
               You're making them all hysterical.

     Vig points the big pistol at an OLDER IRAQI OFFICER who is
     the only one not taking his clothes off.

                         VIG
               Take your fucking rags off, take
               this off. No comprende English,
               motherfucker?

                         TROY
               What is your fucking problem,
               Conrad?

                         VIG
               I'm trying to git him to obey the
               spirit of things but he won't take
               his rags off.

                         TROY
                      (leans down)
               Sir? We need you to disrobe like
               all the other towel heads, OK?

     The Officer does not move, Troy punches his head once. Vig
     and Walter forcibly pull the Iraqi Officer's pants off. Troy
     takes out a bottle of aspirin, eats two.

                         VIG
               Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy.

     Vig points to the Officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled up
     piece of paper is sticking out --

                         TROY
               There's a document in that guy's
               ass, Conrad.

                         VIG
               That's the freaky thing.

                         WALTER
               Do you think he ate it?

                         TROY
               It wouldn't come out perfect like
               that if he ate it.

     Troy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket.

                         TROY
               Go get it, Private.

                         IRAQI OFFICER
               Hasa man timal!

     The Officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by
     Walter as Vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the rolled up,
     greasy paper from the Officer's ass -- Troy looks disgusted.

                         TROY
               Open it up.

                         VIG
               You only gave me one glove.

                         TROY
               I'm sorry I don't have another,
               but you gotta open it up. That's
               how the chain of command works.

     Vig takes out a U.S. Army pen and uses it to unroll the
     greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand.

     CLOSE UP - THE RUMPLED PAPER

     is a handwritten map, with scant Arabic writing, a few spare
     roads, numbers, and three small boxes.

                         VIG
               What the hell is that?

                         TROY
               Important enough to squeeze your
               cheeks for.

     INT. TELEVISION TRUCK - DAY

     In the half-light of dozens of TV monitors playing Iraqi news
     from around the world, Archie Gates madly humps CATHY DAITCH
     on a lawn chair which is slamming into the monitors.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               You are a trained warrior, trained
               warrior, trained warrior, Jesus
               Christ, Colonel!

     TV monitors crash to the floor as she climaxes. Archie lays
     on the floor catching his breath, stares at a sideways
     monitor of soldiers celebrating; she stands, dresses.

                         CATHY DAITCH
                      (breathless)
               What's Bill got?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Just the celebration story.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               That's it?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's it --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               How about you? Did you find
               anything?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               It could be another bullshit lead
               but I need you to help me find a
               guy who might have something on
               the gold --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Who's the guy?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company
               B--

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Barlow.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               Got a map out of a prisoner's head.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Out of a prisoner's head?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               Or his ear, or his ass, or his
               dick, and they got like a fifty
               page full-color mini atlas of
               Saddam's bunkers --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Out of a guy's dick?

     The door explodes open and two MPs grab Archie, pants around
     his ankles, and drag him from the truck.

     EXT. TELEVISION TRUCK - DAY

     Archie is faced by an OLDER TWO STAR GENERAL (GENERAL PYE),
     a YOUNGER ONE STAR GENERAL (GENERAL HORN).

                         GENERAL PYE
               This is not the way we service the
               media, Major. Stop her --

     WHIP PAN TO Cathy runs away as she dresses, MPs grab her.

                         MP
               You are in violation of code 37D,
               grinding Major Gates.

     They let her go. Soldiers in gas suits laugh.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You guys have no manners
               whatsoever --

     Bill Smithson runs up, agitated.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I told you he was with her --

                         GENERAL PYE
               We're handling this, OK?

     The MP pushes Smithson away.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I wanted help with the gold story,
               and he took off on me--

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's a lot of bullshit.

     Smithson is walked away. Archie pulls his pants up.

                         GENERAL PYE
               I give you a prestige job in the
               media war of the century and the
               guy feels neglected.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I'm helping him plenty with his
               big celebration feature -- Where
               did you get this fucking star?

     Archie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of General
     Horn's collar, with its one star.

                         GENERAL HORN
               They made me a general, pal.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               For what? I don't even know what
               we did over here, but Schwartzkopf
               gets a book deal, you get a star,
               Powell gets to be fucking
               president--

                         GENERAL HORN
               Are you high? This is a huge win
               for us.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Running the press pool's a real
               big win for me.

                         GENERAL PYE
               You want us to kill more Americans
               to occupy Iraq?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I'm just saying it's ironic,
               that's all.

                         GENERAL HORN
               What the fuck is ironic?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We got the biggest army in the
               world here but Iraq still has the
               d-bag dictator in power, but
               that's how the world works I guess.

                         GENERAL PYE
               Just take care of Smithson and
               maybe he'll hook you up to consult
               on movies.

                         GENERAL HORN
               It's either that or be a security
               guard when you retire.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Fuck you, Ron.

                         GENERAL HORN
               I'm a general now, you can't say
               fuck you to me.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               OK, sir, but there's another thing
               I'd like to say, if you don't mind.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Go right ahead, Colonel.

     Archie leans wild-eyed into Horn's face and whispers --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn.

     INT. CAPTAIN'S TENT - DAY

     SPLASH -- rubbing alcohol is poured over Vig's extended hand
     by DOC ELGIN, 25, stocky, black, no nonsense.

                         TROY
               You've washed your hands like a

               army in every sense of the word.

     He looks at them.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You are now under my command,
               salute --

     They salute him. He straightens Troy's salute.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What's the guy's name outside?

                         TROY
               Walter.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cappy.

     Walter comes in.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You will take Bill Smithson on a
               special mission to find the gold
               story, but it will be a
               meaningless ride that lasts all
               morning and takes him nowhere near
               Karbala, is that clear?

                         WALTER
               How am I gonna get out of the
               company?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Your captain will be detained by
               a friend of mine.

                         VIG
               Is it true you got to take an
               enemy ear to be Special Forces?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No, but if you talk to anybody
               about this, I'll kill you.

     Vig smile fades as he looks into Archie's cold stare.

     EXT. DESERT CAMP - WIDE SHOT - DAWN

     Three figures in fatigues crouch low to the ground as they
     run to a motorcycle and side car. Walter kickstarts the
     motorcycle. PACO the cameraman sits behind Walter with a
     video camera. Walter's face is painted beige and brown with
     camouflage spots, so is Bill Smithson's, as he crouches in
     the sidecar and dramatically gives Walter the thumb's up.

     EXT. VAN METER'S TENT - DAY

     Cathy Daitch stands next to a cameraman filming Van Meter
     while another man holds a boom over Van Meter's head.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               How about if I lean on it, like
               this?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               Very dashing.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Does it look too posed?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               Would you ever stand like that?

     Van Meter tries a couple of poses.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               I think I might, Jesus, this feels
               stupid.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               You'll get used to it. First
               question: did you dream as a boy
               you'd be commanding an infantry
               company in a desert war?

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               As a boy, I wanted to be either a
               veterinarian or a CIA
               sharpshooter --

     EXT. DESERT - MOVING HUMVEE - MORNING

     Bach's Gloria, from Mass in B Minor plays as

     Pow pow pow, Vig fires his big pistol into the desert.

                         DOC
               Pull.

     Troy throws a painted football into the desert. Doc fires the
     M-16 and blows the ball to pieces.

     Archie drives and moves his hand to the Bach.

     The convertible Humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a
     mounted 60 mm machine gun, a Bart Simpson doll on the grill.

     The Humvee rolls into the vast desert, littered with burned
     out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no people.

                         DOC
               Pull.

     Troy throws another ball, Doc blows it away.

                         TROY
               Pull.

     Doc throws a football from the moving Humvee, Troy fires a
     pistol and misses the ball as it bounces to the desert.

                         TROY
               I gave you a better arc, Doc.

                         TROY
               I threw the ball in a higher arc
               that was easier for you to hit.

               We can all agree there are many
               excellent black quarterbacks.

     Doc throws a ball. Vig fires his giant pistol twice and
     misses.

               This gun's too heavy to shoot
               one-handed like a movie star --

     Vig fires: blam, blam, bam. The Humvee stops abruptly.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Shut the fuck up.

     They sit in embarrassed silence; the joyous Bach choir plays.

     EXT. DESERT DAY

     No more music. Troy, Doc, and Vig stand spread apart. They
     wear white anti-gas suits and hold pistols and drink from
     plastic water bottles. A bomb crater is nearby, a wrecked,
     burned truck to the side, a SKINNY COW meanders.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               When we pull up to the bunker, the
               approach is something called
               violence of action, which is
               standard in special operations. It
               means your movement is so fast and
               decisive that the guards are
               frozen and we haven't fired a
               single shot.

     Troy kicks at something in the sand -- and a decayed human
     arm springs out, attached to a body with a half-rotted face.

                         TROY
               Shit.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We dropped a lot of bombs out here
               and we buried some guys alive --

               What do you mean?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Bradleys with big plows cut
               through the berms and covered the

     DOLLY INTO five terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the
     sand rolls over them.

               Let's rehearse.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     They sit in the Humvee and hold their pistols ready.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We'll say the cow is the primary
               guard outside the bunker. We pull
               up fast, and stop short.

                         TROY
               Got it.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               And -- Go.

     The cow stares as the Humvee pulls up to it fast. Troy and
     Doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow --

     The cow steps back, and explodes.

     Troy and Doc stand splattered with cow entrails. The cow's
     head lands with a thud on the hood of the Humvee.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Who's hurt?

               Mines are forever, Doc. They never
               get all of 'em.

                         TROY
                      (low murmur)
               'If you could, help me Rhonda,
               help help me Rhonda --'

     Archie watches Troy.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Did you guys see any action at all?

                         VIG
               Only night bombing on CNN, except

               guy in the neck--

     Archie takes Vig's BIG PISTOL and EMPTIES THE SHELLS and puts
     them into his pocket.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Is sepsis cool?

                         VIG

               As in septic tank, because that's
               what happens when a bullet hits
               you. The lead tears in there --

               closes down in a convulsive motion
               typical of all gunshot wounds. The
               cavity fills up with bile and
               bacteria and you're fucked.

     Bile fluid fills the cavity.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

                         ARCHIE GATES
               But other than a wound that
               blinds, paralyzes, or castrates,
               the worst wound I've ever seen is
               something called tension pneumo
               thorax --

               Tension pneumo what?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill
               you, but makes a little hole in
               the lung, so every time you
               breathe, a little air leaks into
               the chest cavity, which starts to
               fill up like a balloon. And that
               balloon starts to push your organs
               to the side, crushing your lung,
               your liver, your heart. Your own
               breathing kills you, one breath at
               a time -- kinda like a job you
               can't stand or a bad lie you once
               told.

               That's not fatal, they can stop it.

               If you know how to make another
               little hole in the chest to let
               the air out, just like you would
               with an overinflated tire.

     They look at Archie, scared by this.

                         TROY
               Can we play the Beach Boys when we
               go in?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Bach.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT

     'I Get Around' by The Beach Boys BLASTS as the Humvee speeds
     along. A big American flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at
     the back of the Hummer.

     The Humvee drives fast into the central square of a small
     village of low, sand-colored stucco buildings and shanties.

     Vig drives as the Humvee speeds around the town square,
     zooming past scared Shiites in black robes, a few skinny
     dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi soldiers.

                         VIG
               Where's the bunker?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It should be right --

     He studies the map and points to a decayed green building.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               There.

     Vig jerks the wheel right.  They drive fast.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No -- there.

     Archie points left. Vig jerks the wheel left, drives straight
     toward a low cement building with two Iraqi soldiers in front.

     Iraqi soldiers look scared as the Humvee drives up, like it's
     going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze.

     Vig stands and speaks into a megaphone.

                         VIG
               We are the Army of the United
               States of America. We are here to
               protect you. Remain calm.

     Troy and Doc leap from the Humvee with pistols drawn and
     their free hands held up in a 'halt' sign. The TWO IRAQI
     GUARDS look stunned as Troy and Doc simply take their machine
     guns and put the Iraqis face down on the ground. Troy and Doc
     pull out plastic twist hand-cuffs, as used in urban riots.

     Archie bounds forward holding up a thick white document.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Orders from President Bush, step
               aside.

     Troy finishes handcuffing one of the Iraqi soldiers, as a
     gaunt mother, with a baby in her arms, opens her blouse,
     revealing her small breasts. Other peasants gather.

                         IRAQI MOTHER
               No milk. Baby milk.

     Troy looks shocked until Archie suddenly pushes him past the
     Iraqi mother and to the door of the bunker, which Doc holds.

     INT. BUNKER - DAY

     Five IRAQI SOLDIERS look disoriented and scared as they hold
     their hands up in the air.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Do not panic.  Step outside --

               We are here for your protection
               and safety.

     Iraqi women and children kiss Vig's feet.

     The five Iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands
     raised, and the starved Shiite civilians spit and throw
     stones at them while 'I Get Around' keeps playing.

                         VIG
               Ya'll be cool now, this is the
               U.S. Marines in charge here.

     INT. STAIRWELL - BUNKER

     Archie runs down the narrow stairs of the bunker, followed by
     Troy and Doc.

     INT. BASEMENT OF BUNKER - DAY

     Doc lashes an Iraqi's hands behind his back and cuffs him.

     Troy shoots the door lock with his pistol.  Then backs up and
     gives it a running shoulder. The door doesn't budge.

                         TROY
               Shit.

     He holds his shoulder in pain.  Archie kicks the door
     repeatedly.  Troy joins him, it finally flies open.

                         TROY
               Freeze.

     Troy is embraced by an Iraqi soldier, about 25.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               I am love United States of
               Freedom. I am hate Saddam.

     Troy tries some karate moves, jerking his elbows to dislodge
     the Iraqi from the bear hug --

                         TROY
               Ya -- ya -- ha --

     Doc points his pistol in the Iraqi's face.

                         DOC
               Let him go.

     The Iraqi throws his hands in the air.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               No problem, my friend.

     Archie goes to a series of WOODEN CRATES the size of file
     cabinets, where Doc helps Archie take off his back pack.
     Archie pulls out a bolt cutter and a pneumatic saw, both
     attached to a small air tank - and opens the crate, which is
     filled with hundreds of Kuwaiti passports.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               You look for the chemical weapon?

                         TROY
               No. We look for the gold.

     They use the power tools to open the second crate -- also
     filled with hundreds of passports.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Where's the gold?

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               They move the gold.

     Archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the Iraqi,
     who says nothing.

                         DOC
               Kill him.

                         ARCHIE GATES

                         TROY
               Kill him now.

     They point their guns. It's a show. Archie holds the map.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Where?

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
                      (points to map)
               This bunker. I'll take you.

     EXT. BUNKER - DAY

     FOUR NEW IRAQI SOLDIERS, armed with rifles, run from the far
     side of the square and start shooting.

     30 rock-throwing Shiite scatter at the gunfire. TWO MEN fall
     to the ground as they are shot.

                         CHILD
               Ma-Maa.

     Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone
     as he points his big unloaded pistol. The soldiers point
     their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of
     them look to the side and shout.

                         ARMED IRAQI SOLDIER
               Ganan azwar!

     PAN TO a shiny METAL TANKER TRUCK three hundred yards out,
     bearing down fast on the village square.

     The soldiers open fire on the truck.

     INT - THE CAB OF THE TANKER TRUCK

     The Shiite riding shotgun fires back, as the windshield
     shatters on the truck. The driver is dead. The other Shiite
     grabs the wheel.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     Archie bursts out the front door, followed by Troy and Doc.
     They freeze as --

     The tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet away.

     An Iraqi soldier fires a grenade-launcher off his shoulder
     which explodes the container on the back of the truck --

     Milk explodes everywhere, gushing around the wheels of the
     Humvee and the feet of Archie and the others.

     Shiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush
     out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk. Other Shiites
     crowd the Humvee and climb in.

     Iraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck.
     Troy and Doc point their guns in the crowd.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Move. Out of the way.

     Archie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee.

                         SHIITE WOMAN
               Hos-pital.

     She holds a SHIRTLESS BOY of 7 with a bandage around his
     entire chest. Doc pushes her off the Humvee.

                         SHIITE MAN
               America help.

     He grabs Archie. Troy shoves the man off the vehicle. Vig
     starts the engine.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Give them MRE's.

     Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army
     Meal Rations to the crowd -- Vig leans on the horn.

     The friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it
     starts to pull away. Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out,
     and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites.

     Archie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away.

     EXT. DESERT MARSH - DAY

     Raging oil fires, 50 feet high -- billowing black smoke.
     Walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke. Paco the
     Cameraman sits on back. Bill Smithson sits in the sidecar.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               This is boring, I already did this
               damn story, goddamn it, where the
               hell is the gold?

                         WALTER
               How about rare pelican migration
               out by the marshes?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               What?

                         WALTER
               These brave pelicans are migrating
               in spite of massive pollution --

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Fuck that. Stop the bike.

     Walter keeps driving.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Doc gets out of the stopped Humvee, shaken, and walks around.

                         DOC
               I'm all right, I'm cool.

     He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.
     Archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What is the art of war, because it
               is not for killing people, it's a
               stratagem to give life to many by
               killing the evil perpetrated by a
               few -- I am burning up in this
               goddamn suit --

     He angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat-drenched
     green T-shirt underneath.  Troy and Vig guzzle water.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Discriminating use of violence as
               a last resort, and even then,
               carefully, surgically, that's what
               I learned, that's what I'm good
               at. But now they underestimate all
               this, bomb the same towns for six
               weeks  and still leave the scumbag
               dictator to starve and butcher his
               own people.

     The others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits.

                         TROY
                      (agitated)
               I don't even know what happened
               back there. Civilians were
               spitting on their own soldiers;
               the soldiers were shooting the
               civilians and ignoring us --

                         DOC
               They already surrendered to us.
               Now they're after Shiites.

                         VIG
               What exactly is a Shiite?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They make up the ethnic majority
               but they don't have any power.
               When Bush pulled us out, he told
               them to start a civil war to bring
               Saddam down, and now they're
               getting wasted.

                         VIG
                      (totally puzzled)
               The civil war? How could it be the
               civil war?

     Vig looks puzzled.

                         TROY
               It's a war inside the same
               country, Conrad. That's a civil
               war.

     Archie chucks each of them MARINE UNIFORMS without name tags
     which everyone puts on, except Troy.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Put these on, we are now U.S.
               Marines.

                         TROY
               I can't do this, OK? Because I've
               got a family and if I shit in a
               bag the rest of my life cuz I got
               shot after the war's already over
               that would be pretty fucking

               Necessity. That's what dictates
               what will happen at any given time
               in life. Necessity says we don't
               spend American lives taking out
               Saddam,  which leaves Saddam the
               necessity of taking out the
               Shiites so he can stay in power,
               which leaves us to take the gold.

                         TROY
               We could've been shot.

               Did you notice they didn't touch
               us?  We decimated their entire
               country. They're scared shitless
               of us. [looks at his watch]
               There's time to try another

               fashionable kevlar. As a necessity.

     He pulls a vest out of the Humvee.

     EXT. MARSH

     The motorcycle is stopped by the marsh. Siberian pelicans fly
     all around. Many lie dead on the ground.  Bill Smithson paces
     with a cell phone.

                         BILL SMITHSON

               I think the Saddam story goes more
               for the jugular, journalistically
               speaking, Al. Let's grow some
               balls and do the Shiite uprising,
               for Christ's sake.

     Bill Smithson closes the cell phone.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               We're going north to do the
               Shiites.

                         WALTER
               I thought the gold was the hot
               spot.

               Karbala's the new hotspot, and
               I'm driving.

                         WALTER
               Military regulations, you cannot
               drive.

     Smithson mounts the bike. The cameraman sits on back. Walter
     points his pistol at Smithson.

                         WALTER
               Get off the vehicle, sir.

     Smithson starts the bike.

                         WALTER
               Don't make me shoot you, sir.

     The bike pulls out, leaving him behind. He runs after the
     bike and jumps into the side car.

     EXT. COMPANY B CAMP - DAY

     Captain Van Meter strolls, handling an M-16.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               The M-16 is the basic weapon of
               the infantry. During Vietnam, it
               was fully automatic.

                         GENERAL HORN (O.S.)
               Doug?

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Yes, General.

                         GENERAL HORN
               What the fuck are you doing?

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Well, I'm giving an interview to
               CBS.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Do you have authorization?

     Van Meter pulls out a folded paper and gives it to the
     general, who looks at it.

                         GENERAL HORN
               No.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               No?

                         GENERAL HORN
               Who gave you this?

               Major Gates.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Archie Gates gave you this? Jesus
               Christ, Doug, come with me.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               I don't get to do the interview?

                         GENERAL HORN

     EXT. ANOTHER VILLAGE OUTSIDE KARBALA - DAY

     The Hummer zips into a bigger village piazza with an old
     fortress at one end, and races straight to the entrance to an
     underground bunker in the middle of the piazza.

     Troy and Doc leap out, hold pistols out at arm's length as
     they accost TWO IRAQI SOLDIERS pointing rifles at them.

                         TROY

     Troy and Doc shove the two Iraqis face down in the dirt and
     cuff their hands behind their backs.

     INT. SECOND IRAQI BUNKER - DAY

     Archie runs down a narrow cement corridor, pistol held at
     arm's length, white document in the other hand; followed by
     Troy and Doc, pistols drawn.

     An IRAQI SOLDIER steps into the corridor at the far end, sees
     Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back. Archie and
     Troy run right past the scared Iraqi. Doc comes third,
     slamming the Iraqi face down and cuffing him.

     Archie kicks a door open and goes in, followed by Troy.

     INT. INNER ROOM, SECOND IRAQI BUNKER - DAY

     Archie and Troy burst in, pointing their guns aggressively.

               Freeze.

     A large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new
     appliances: blenders, cuisinarts, CD players, small TVs. A
     huge portrait of Saddam Hussein covers one wall.

     A television plays a rerun of 'Happy Days' in Arabic.

     Another TV: CNN's first reports of the Rodney King beating.

     An IRAQI CAPTAIN sits in a chair in front of the TVs.

     TWO IRAQIS sit loading rifles. Two others sit at a radio.

     They all jump to their feet when Archie bursts in, except for
     the officer watching 'Happy Days' and CNN..

     One of the rifle-loading Iraqis tries to run. Troy heads him
     off with his pistol --

     and ducks -- except Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Never hit anyone with your pistol,

     The Iraqi looks puzzled.

               This is bad music, understand?
               It's bad for you.

                         DOC (O.S.)
               Hey --

     WHIP PAN TO the resistant Iraqi struggles to break away and
     Doc punches him in the head twice, the Iraqi starts crying.

                         ARCHIE GATES
                      (to Iraqi Captain)
               Where's the gold, Captain? Tell us
               so we don't have to kill you.

                         TROY
               There's another room over here.

     PAN TO Troy pointing to a narrow door in a corner of the
     room. Archie kicks it open.

     INT. INNER ROOM - DAY

     A bound, naked SHIITE MAN IN GLASSES, clean shaven, sits on
     the floor in a five foot square shallow metal box, four
     inches deep, filled with water. There is an electric cable
     going into the water. The naked Shiite in glasses shakes.

     Troy watches Archie walk over and yank the cable out.

                         IRAQI SARGEANT
               I am just do my job, buddy.

     Archie pauses, then gives the Sargeant a backhand that sends
     him flying to the corner. Archie steps on the man's wrist,
     takes the pistol out of his hand. Troy watches.

     Archie turns and sees TEN SHIITES across the room: 3 MEN, 3
     WOMEN, 4 CHILDREN. The men and women are bound and GAGGED.

     Archie steps toward the Shiites, but the INTERROGATOR, 35,
     also a captain, steps in his way.

                         INTERROGATOR
               These Shiite. Iraq problem. United
               States is out now.

     Archie stares at the INTERROGATOR with contempt.

                         INTERROGATOR
               We take them outside, so it don't
               bother you, OK, sir? Kata fanam.

     The disarmed Iraqi Sargeant NODS and opens a small rear door
     and pushes the Shiites out. Archie walks back to the main
     room and points his pistol in the Captain's face.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Take us to the basement.

     EXT. FRONT OF BUNKER TWO - DAY

     Vig keeps the TWO CUFFED IRAQI GUARDS on the ground at gun
     point as 15 SHIITES with crude clubs and sling shots encircle.

     One of the Shiites shoots a rock from the slingshot and nails
     a handcuffed Iraqi in the back of the head.

                         VIG
               Don't start this shit again.

     The Shiites back away as Vig motions with his big pistol.

                         VIG
               I know ya'll Shiite gettin' yer
               asses whipped --  Hey, what the
               hell is going on here?

     PAN TO the ten Shiites, and the naked Man with Glasses, who
     is getting dressed, exiting the side of the bunker, ushered
     by the unarmed Iraqi Sargeant.

                         VIG
               Git on the fucking ground, Arab.

                         IRAQI SARGEANT
               Prisoner stay. Gabar matan.

                         VIG
               What the fuck are you talking
               about?

     Suddenly a SHIITE WOMAN runs up to the tortured Shiite Man
     with Glasses and embraces him, sobbing. A LITTLE GIRL with
     dirty casts on both broken arms runs up and hugs his legs.

     The bound Shiite prisoners start to walk away from the
     bunker, and the unarmed Sargeant has a fit.

                         IRAQI SARGEANT
               Kinam vanir! Vanir!

     He chases the prisoners, pushes them back. The free Shiites
     shoot rocks and club him.

                         VIG
               Goddamn it everybody calm down.

     INT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     Archie runs down several narrow sets of cement stairs,
     followed by the Interrogator, the other Iraqi Captain, Troy,
     and Doc. (SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH)

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               It's my ass, donkey dick, Saddam
               will shoot me dead.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Saddam worries more about the
               Shiite than the gold.

     EXT. BUNKER - DAY

     The Shiite crowd curses and spits on the Iraqi soldiers. The
     Sargeant is beaten.

     Suddenly an Iraqi armored truck with a mounted machine gun
     races up and SEVEN IRAQI SOLDIERS pour out swinging clubs,
     followed by an IRAQI MAJOR, about 45. The Iraqi soldiers
     savagely beat the Shiites.

     Vig looks horrified as he watches.

     TWO SOLDIERS grab the Woman from the Man With Glasses, and
     drag her into a circle with three other soldiers; the ten
     year-old girl with dirty casts on both arms, screams and
     punches at them.

     The Man With Glasses is held down at knife point.

                         VIG
                      (into the megaphone)
               This is the United States Military.

     The Iraqi Major glances over at Vig, but the soldiers do not
     stop brutalizing the Shiites -- they round up eight more
     Shiites and make them lay face down.

     INT. BASEMENT

     Troy and Doc disarm TWO GUARDS outside a door in the basement.

     Archie goes through the door, followed by the Iraqi
     Interrogator and Captain.

     INT. ROOM OF BUNKER 2 - DAY

     Bright white cement, many overhead lights and a high ceiling.
     empty but for 15 brand new, jumbo-sized Louis Vuitton
     suitcases standing neatly in a row in the center of the room.

     Archie stands looking at the suitcases with Troy and Doc.

     Several of the big Vuitton suitcases are laid on their sides
     by Archie, Troy and Doc.

     The Iraqi Captain paces frantically punching and kicking the
     walls and talking (SUBTITLED in ENGLISH).

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               It's Saddam's gold.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Shut up, he signed the treaty.

     The suitcases are quickly unzipped. One suitcase is full of
     gleaming antique silverware. One suitcase is full of jewelry.

     Archie opens one full of hundreds of gold Cartier watches.

     Troy and Doc slip a handful of jewelry into their pockets.

     The Iraqi Captain goes nuts, throwing himself on Doc's back,
     choking Doc, who flails about. Troy punches the Iraqi in the
     head and rips him off Doc.

     Archie puts his pistol in the man's face.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Listen to me: we leave you alone
               to kill your Shiites, but
               everything you took from Kuwait,
               that belongs to us now, understand?

     He turns to Doc.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Put it back.

                         DOC
               Why?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Stick to the plan. The plan is for
               gold.

     Doc and Troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of jewelry.

     Archie opens another Vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside -
     it's full of Kuwaiti passports.

     When Doc opens the next suitcase, he freezes. Archie looks
     over and freezes. Troy closes cuffs behind the Captain's back
     and looks over his shoulder -- wide-eyed.

     The very large Vuitton suitcase is filled with five-kilo
     bricks of gold. They all stare. Troy picks one up.

                         TROY
               Is this five kilos?

     Archie holds another brick.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Yeah, that's five kilos.

                         TROY
               Five, six, seven, eight, there's
               sixty bricks in this suitcase.

                         DOC
               Times 50K each --

                         TROY
               Three million dollars.

     Archie opens another large Vuitton suitcase, and it is also
     filled with sixty bars. Troy opens another suitcase, there's
     another sixty bars. Doc opens another, another sixty bars.
     They frantically check all of the suitcases. The handcuffed
     Captain is crying.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each.
               That's thirty million dollars.

     Archie, Doc and Troy look at each other in shock.

     With effort, Doc and Troy help Archie pick up the heavy,
     jumbo-sized suitcase sideways, like a table top.

                         TROY
               I'm gonna get a fleet of Lexus
               convertibles in different colors.

                         DOC
               I told you Lexus doesn't make a
               convertible.

                         TROY
               I'll bet you a Lexus they do.

                         DOC
               OK, you're on for a Lexus, but it
               won't be a convertible.

     Suddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to the
     floor; one lands on Troy's foot. He jumps in pain.

                         TROY
               Shit.

     Archie, Troy, and Doc hoist another suitcase sideways and the
     bricks rip through and fall to the floor --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They didn't get it here in these
               bags.

                         DOC
               The tensilary strength goes to 200
               pounds.

                         TROY
               The what?

                         DOC
               Tensilary strength, it's what the
               suitcase can hold.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Why would you know that?

                         TROY
               He works at an airport.

                         DOC
               60 bars, 13 pounds each is like --
               800 pounds. The smaller Vuittons
               handle 65.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You got any more luggage here?

     The Interrogator looks at him.

     INT. BUNKER BASEMENT - LATER

     120 small, round, Vuitton overnight bags, laid out and
     opened, cover the entire floor of the basement.

     Troy and Doc finish putting 5 bars in each bag. Archie paces,
     sweating, speedy like he's on cocaine.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It's crazy to take it all, we're
               not prepared for it. It's crazy
               not to take it all, how can we
               leave it?

     Troy and Doc look nervous.

                         TROY
               What's the shipping plan?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I told you that's handled.

                         TROY
               How is it handled? You have to
               tell us now.

                         DOC
               Yeah, tell us now.

                         ARCHIE GATES
                      (pacing)
               I've got a friend, he's in French
               Special Forces. He's gonna put it
               in barrels filled with oil and
               bury it. In a few weeks, he'll
               drive it to Yanbu --

                         TROY
               Where's Yanbu?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It's a port in Saudi.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

                         TROY
               I don't know about getting them to
               Baltimore, but these hat boxes
               ain't gonna fit in the Humvee.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We need a trailer.

                         TROY
               OK, I'll call U-Haul in Karbala to
               see what they have on the lot
               today.

                         ARCHIE GATES

     INT. NARROW CEMENT STAIRCASE OF BUNKER

     Troy runs up the stairs.

     EXT. BUNKER - DAY

     Troy runs out the front door.

                         TROY
               Conrad, we need a trailer --

     The Iraqi Major stares coldly at Troy. Troy stares at the two
     soldiers beating Shiites; five others clustered around the
     woman on the ground.

                         VIG
               Did you get it? Troy, did you get
               it?

                         TROY
               Yeah, we got it.

                         VIG
               Is it a lot?

                         TROY
               Yeah, it's a lot.

     LATER

     Troy and Vig untangle, with difficulty, an ox cart from a
     messy pile of old ox carts against a bombed out building.
     Troy looks troubled --

                         TROY
                      (under his breath)
               'Little deuce coupe with a fiat

     The Little Girl with arm casts is screaming while her father,
     the Man In Glasses, tries to hold her.

     Troy and Vig quickly chain the ox cart to the Humvee.

                         TROY
               'She's my little deuce coupe --'

     INT. NARROW CEMENT STAIRCASE OF BUNKER

     Archie, Doc, the Interrogator run up carrying Vuitton cases.

     INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM OF BUNKER - DAY

     They hurry past the huge poster of Saddam, the TVs playing
     'Happy Days' and Rodney King, the many shelves of stereos,
     etc., and past the soldiers lying face down, handcuffed.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     Archie, Doc, and the Interrogator charge out of the bunker
     with Vuitton luggage and put it onto the ox cart Troy has
     rigged. Archie and Doc stop and stare in shock --
     Soldiers 6 & 7 drag and beat Shiites; 5 wounded men and women
     lie on the ground bleeding. A cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with
     a bleeding head. Five soldiers continue to encircle someone
     (the Shiite woman). The Man In Glasses and the Little Girl
     PRAY in ARABIC as they bow on the ground.

     Troy and Vig stare back at Archie, looking tense.

     The Iraqi Major greets the Interrogator warmly and they
     embrace. Then the Major salutes Archie.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We take the Kuwaiti gold. Yes.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Saddam cannot keep.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No, Saddam cannot keep.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Saddam have too many problem today.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               He certainly does.

     Shiites run past throwing rocks at Iraqi soldiers 6 & 7 who
     tackle and pummel them to the ground.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               You need help to load?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We can do it ourselves.

     The Major turns and shouts --

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Hazal jarat finan.

     Iraqis 6 & 7 jog over. The soldiers are out of breath.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               These man help you.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You go away fast from this
               bullshit.

     Archie looks at one soldier's hands.

     CLOSE UP: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists.

     PAN UP TO THE FACES of the Iraqi soldiers.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Let's load up and get out of here.

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Iraqi Soldiers 6 & 7 carry suitcases up the narrow stairs.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     Luggage is loaded into the Humvee and the cart while Troy
     directs Iraqis 6 & 7; Doc and Vig help.

                         TROY
               Lay that one flat; OK, sideways --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               This isn't gonna work.

                         TROY
               Sure it is --

     The cart collapses from the weight into a pile of broken wood.

     The Vuitton bags roll onto the debris-cluttered ground, one
     goes through a pool of blood. Doc picks the case up.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               You need a truck.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We'll rig two carts.

                         TROY
               Let's take the truck.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're not taking their truck.

                         TROY
               Why not?

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               We cooperate with peace accord.
               Please take truck.

                         TROY
               Let's take the truck.

     Archie looks vaguely disgusted.

     Troy backs the truck up.

     Vuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck,
     which is completely full.

     Archie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee. Vig sits next to
     him. Archie starts the engine. Iraqi 6 taps on the door of
     the Humvee by way of saying goodbye. Archie nods.

     The Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Nazaran yafit haisul.

     Archie watches as Iraqis 6 & 7 walk directly to the circle of
     soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been
     raped. They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in
     an open area and shoot her dead.

     Troy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away. Doc stares.

     Archie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there
     for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman.

     The Girl in arm casts screams. She is grabbed by the hair and
     pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses
     punches him and takes the girl. The soldier chases them with
     a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.

     Archie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks
     slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               This has to stop.

     The Iraqis look at him. The soldier with the knife continues
     to slash the Man In Glasses.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You get your ass kick in a war, it
               feel good to be strong again.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What did you say?

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               You go now, please.

     He salutes Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I don't think so. I'm sure you
               know about the Geneva Convention,
               right?

                         INTERROGATOR
               Geneva convention? You bomb my
               house, man.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               That Shiite man is leader of
               uprising. He kill my man.

                         TROY
               Archie, let's stick to the plan,
               sir. The plan is for gold, right?

                         DOC
               We can help them first, then be on
               our way.

                         TROY
               No, we can't. It's not what we're
               here for.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               How much?

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               What?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               How much gold do you want to let
               these people come with us?

     The Iraqi Major smiles. The Interrogator laughs.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Cannot do.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What do you mean, cannot do? I'm
               offering you a lot of money.

     The Iraqi Major continues smiling.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Cannot let Shiite go --

                         INTERROGATOR
               Saddam kill us.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Saddam kill to me if we let them
               go, OK? Now you go.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cover me.

                         TROY
               Jesus Christ, we can't save
               everybody.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Are you listening? I said cover me.

     Troy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the
     truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee, and they nervously point
     their pistols. Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come
     forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also
     come forward. To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near
     Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight
     prone Shiite prisoners laying face down.

     Vig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and
     mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is
               that clear?

                         VIG
               Yes, sir.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Because we know what bullets do to
               vital organs, don't we?

                         VIG
               Make infected pockets filled with
               bile, sir.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's right, that's what they do.

     Troy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward
     the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl.

     Archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling
     the blade away from the man's body. He holds the soldier's
     wrist up. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free
     hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting
     the Iraqi into a choke hold. The soldier drops the knife in
     the dirt.

     The bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground,
     clutching the Little Girl in arm casts.

     Troy, Doc, Vig point their guns. The Iraqi Major is pissed.

     Archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face
     down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. Archie
     helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl,
     and walks them over to the Humvee.

     Two Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick
     them back down.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
                      (pissed)
               U.S.A. is out of Shiite war.

     The Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to
     the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No shooting.

     Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi
     soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.

     CUT BACK TO the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his
     machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee.

     Archie winces, but doesn't let go. The Major does it again,
     smashing Archie's hand. Archie winces, doesn't let go. The
     Major tries to jerk the barrel up, but Archie pushes it down,
     and it fires by accident, into the Major's leg. The Major
     howls with pain. Blood dribbles out the bottom of his pants
     leg like piss.

     Troy covers Iraqi 6 with his rifle.

                         TROY
               What's happening?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Accident. Stay cool.

     Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun from one Iraqi
     in the rear to another, but doesn't shoot. Iraqi soldiers
     point their rifles at the Americans.

     ANGLE ON TROY

                         TROY
               No.

     WHIP PAN TO Iraqi 6 jerks his rifle toward Archie and fires.

     The sound cuts out.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: WHIP PAN from Iraqi rifle to Archie.

     The only SOUND is the BULLET PIERCING THE FLESH of Archie's
     lower left arm and tearing his muscle as it passes through.
     Archie grimaces violently in pain.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Troy fires his pistol. NO SOUND except
     for the SLOW MOTION SOUND of the BULLET EXPLODING.

     SLOW MOTION: The bullet tears through Iraqi 6's chest.

     THE ONLY SOUND is the IRAQI'S HEARTBEAT, the bullet tearing
     flesh and crushing bone, and the heartbeat stopping with a
     VIOLENT SPLASH. Iraqi 6 falls to the ground with only a dull
     thud and the slow clank of his gear.

     REGULAR SPEED: Vig swings the mounted machine gun from one
     Iraqi to another, but still doesn't shoot. He looks terrified
     as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.

     Iraqi 7 FIRES twice.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: a bullet tears into Troy's chest with
     a DULL SNAP. He winces in pain.

     PAN TO the windshield of the Humvee shatters behind Doc; he
     turns and fires his pistol.

     PAN TO -- slightly slow motion: NO SOUND EXCEPT THE BULLET
     TEARING INTO IRAQI 7'S KNEE, smashing through bone. He falls
     to the ground clutching his leg.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Vig swings the mounted machine gun and
     FIRES. NO SOUND BUT THE SLOW CRACKS OF THE RED TRACER BULLETS
     EXPLODING from the gun.

     SLOW MOTION: tracer bullets slice across the face of Iraqi 5
     and Iraqi 2 in the rear, NO SOUND BUT THE BULLETS BREAKING
     THROUGH BONE AND FLESH.

     SLOW MOTION: Archie jams his pistol under the Major's chin
     and FIRES -- the ONLY SOUND IS THE. SLOW EXPLOSION OF THE GUN,
     and the slow tearing of tissue, ending with a sharp SNAP as
     the tissue, bone, and the bullet CRACK out the top of the
     Iraqi Major's head.

     HIGH ANGLE LOOKING DOWN -- replay of entire shoot out at
     REGULAR SPEED. Ending on the wide-eyed Little Girl with her
     hand in her mouth, staring.

     ANOTHER ANGLE -- replay of entire shoot out at REGULAR SPEED.
     Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.

     The dead Iraqi Major lies face down in sand with eyes open;
     the Interrogator holds his hand and WEEPS.

     Archie's lightly blood-flecked face stares down at the dead
     Major, clouds pass overhead.

     Dead Iraqi 6 lies with legs twisted under his body.

     A rivulet of blood trickles through the sand. A spider runs
     across it and gets stuck.

     LOW ANGLE up at Doc, stone still, staring straight ahead as
     clouds pass slowly above him in the sky.

     Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun back and forth.

     Troy, drenched in sweat, looks pained as he unbuttons his
     shirt: there's a gunshot in his kevlar vest. The slug drops
     out of the dent, into his hand -- he exhales.

     Iraqis 2, 3, 4, and the Sargeant, throw their hands up in
     surrender and drop their weapons.  Big Iraqi 2 walks toward
     the Humvee in surrender, and bows down.

     Archie points.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cover these three.

     Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining
     Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Doc.

     Doc follows Archie over to the three Iraqi soldiers.

                         DOC
               Down.

     The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.

                         IRAQI SOLDIER
               Kazal stan hamir in fatar.

     Doc takes the Iraqi soldiers' guns and pushes them down.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Put the Shiites in the Humvee.

                         TROY
               There's no room.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Make room.

                         TROY
               What the fuck happened to
               necessity?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It just changed.

                         TROY
               Not for me.

     Shiites and Iraqi soldiers watch the debate nervously.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Obey the fucking order, Barlow.

                         TROY
               This is fucked up.

     Doc points to the Shiites.

                         DOC
               What if that was you?

     Troy displays the gunshot in the Kevlar.

                         TROY
               What if this was you not wearing
               Kevlar?

     Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK. They turn.

     A tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street,
     followed by a truck with a rocket launcher.

                         TROY
               Great, a fucking tank. That should
               send us on our way.

                         VIG
               Grenade launcher, sir.

     Vig struggles to lift the grenade launcher.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No. Let's get out of here.

                         TROY
               It's about fucking time.

     Troy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine.
     Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig.

     PAN TO the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the
     Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee. Doc jumps in.

     The tank approaches. The Humvee pulls away. The tank rolls in
     from the side, but the tank turret WHINES and CLICKS, stuck
     in place. An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank.

                         TANK IRAQI
               Hazal mafan.

     He gestures to the whining, stuck, turret. Another Iraqi
     tries pushing the turret. The truck with the small rocket
     launcher pulls up.

     INT./EXT. HUMVEE

     as it bounces along fast. Archie is in pain while Doc pours
     disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left
     arm, and wraps it. Vig looks terrified as he drives.

     INT. TRUCK

     Troy, driving alone, speeds the truck as fast as it will go,
     bouncing along the road.

                         TROY
               We were home free, you stupid son
               of a bitch.

     WIDE AERIAL SHOT

     the truck is 60 yards behind the Humvee

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               What's the tank doing?

     POV

     through Doc's jiggling binoculars of the tank turning.

                         DOC (O.S.)
               Lining us up --

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     Vig pushes the Humvee's accelerator to the floor.
         
     The Shiite Man In Glasses and his Little Girl cling to the
     Humvee as they sit on top of the Vuitton hat cases with eight
     other Shiites, including TWO FIVE YEAR OLDS, A BOY AND GIRL.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     Two Iraqi soldiers take a THIN ROCKET, four feet long, and
     load a clear plastic canister of brown fluid into it. A
     GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, a soldier is hit in the arm.

     WHIP PAN TO a Shiite boy with an old rifle in the third floor
     window of a small stone building. Iraqis shout and point at
     the sniper. The tank turns to the building.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     The Humvee drives fast over the bumpy two-lane road.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     The tank fires a round at the building which COLLAPSES.

     INT. SHIITE BUILDING - DAY

     A SHIITE MOTHER, FATHER, AND TWO CHILDREN pray at a crude
     table when the ceiling collapses.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     The Iraqi soldiers fire the rocket launcher.

                         DOC (O.S.)
               Incoming.

     EXT. DESERT -  DAY

     Vig turns the speeding Humvee off the road. Archie jerks the
     wheel back.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Stay on the road.

                         VIG
               I don't wanna get hit.

     SLOW MOTION: Doc looks straight up with the binoculars.

     SLOW MOTION: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke
     across the sky.

     REAR OF HUMVEE, SLOW MOTION: half the Shiites hunch down,
     bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their
     necks, looking straight up into the sky. They cower when
     there is an EXPLOSION above.

     PAN UP TO - REGULAR SPEED: the ROCKET EXPLODES in the sky a
     hundred yards above the Humvee -- INTO A BROWN CLOUD.

                         DOC
               Gas.

     Troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up
     at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast.

     Archie and Doc grapple to put on their gas masks. Vig reaches
     around behind him for his mask as he drives.

                         VIG
               Where's my mask?

     He accidentally veers off the road into the open desert.

     ZOOM IN TO a field of mines sitting right on top of the sand,
     20 yards ahead. [Iraqi mines were often placed this way]

     ZOOM IN ON Archie's alarmed face

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Mine.

     Archie dives from the Humvee followed by Vig, Doc, the Man In
     Glasses holding the Little Girl, the other Shiites, including
     the Two Five Year Olds. The Hummer drives ten yards, hits the
     first mine with an explosion and flies into the air --

     INT. TRUCK DRIVEN BY TROY

     Flying debris smashes the windshield. Troy instinctively
     jerks the wheel and the truck flips onto its side and slides
     across the sand.

     EXT. MINEFIELD

     The airborne Humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is
     blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces.

     Troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a
     halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked Humvee.

     SILENCE. A wheel on the wrecked Humvee spin in the air,
     squeaking.

     Louis Vuitton suitcases are scattered all over. One has
     opened and the gold bars are spilled around.

     Shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some
     limping. They cover their faces with their clothes as the
     dense brown fog descends around them.

     Vig's right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess -- he
     gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down.

     Archie puts his gas mask on the Little Girl with arm casts.
     Doc takes his mask off when he sees what Archie has done and
     gives it to the Shiite Man in Glasses.

     Doc picks up Vig's glasses and hands them to Vig, who stands,
     blinking his one good eye, while blood streams down his face.

                         DOC
               Cover your face, Conrad. Cover
               your mouth, man.

     Vig is in shock. Doc lifts Vig's bloody hand to Vig's mouth.
     Unseen in the fog, Troy climbs out of the overturned truck.

     He picks up two Vuitton hat cases, looks up, sees the TWO
     LITTLE CHILDREN from the Humvee, running across a mine field
     SCREAMING.

                         TROY
               Hey. Stop.

     Troy stands watching as the children run farther away, crying.

                         TROY
               Goddamn it.

     He runs, hard, after the children, who are now 70 yards away,
     the Vuitton hat cases banging against his legs.

     Doc pulls a syringe from a sterile packet, is about to stick
     it into his leg when Archie grabs his hand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Don't do it, this isn't sarin.
               We'd be dead by now.

     EXT. DESERT - MINEFIELD

     Troy chases the children through the brown fog, he drops one
     of the suitcases, catches up to the Girl and scoops her up in
     his left arm and covers her face with her coat.

     TROY'S POV

     as he runs between land mines after the Boy, who is way ahead.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     Troy drops the other Vuitton bag, catches the Boy and has
     both children under his arms like footballs -- when suddenly
     Troy is grabbed from behind with a cord around his neck -- he
     lands on his back with the two children in his arms.

     TROY'S POV LOOKING UP

     the Iraqi Interrogator, wearing a gas mask, kicks Troy in the
     head. The screaming Children are torn from Troy's arms by
     Iraqi soldiers. Troy reaches for his pistol and it is ripped
     from his hand as he is dragged to an Iraqi jeep.

     EXT. DESERT - NEAR ARCHIE AND DOC

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Does anybody see Barlow?

     Archie and Doc circle through the thick haze carrying a
     Vuitton hat case and cover their mouths and noses.

                         DOC
               I can't even see the truck.

     About five Shiites wander around, confused.

                         VIG
               Look out.

     Archie spins around, drops the bag and points his pistol.

     TWO BLACK ROBED FIGURES pick up Vuitton hat cases.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Don't move.

     A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared
     Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.

     More black cloaked figures appear. There are THIRTY IN ALL.

     Archie, Doc, and Vig look disoriented, point their pistols
     around as black robes appear and lead the Shiites away.

                         VIG
               What's going on?

     The robes lead the Shiites to a 4 FOOT HIGH TUNNEL ENTRANCE
     in a mound of desert earth and disappear into it.

     Vig stands and rubs his one good eye. Doc grabs Vig by the
     arm and pulls him back toward the tunnel.

                         DOC
               Get in the tunnel.

     Vig jerks his arm away.

                         VIG
               Troy.

     Doc grabs Vig.

                         DOC
               You're gonna die.

     Vig punches Doc in the side of the head. Doc punches Vig in
     the stomach. They fall to the ground, fighting.

     Archie searches for Troy in the brown haze.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Barlow.

     Two black-robed figures pull Vig off Doc and drag him to the
     tunnel. Another robed figure pulls Doc to the tunnel.

     Archie walks, looks for Troy, chokes, vomits into the sand.
     A black robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back
     to the tunnel, where they disappear inside.

     INT. TUNNEL - DAY

     Chaos. People choking and vomiting. GAS LANTERNS SWING. The
     tunnel is 6 feet tall. Buckets are passed, filled with oiled
     rags that people use to wipe their faces. Archie takes a
     dripping rag and wipes his eyes, nose, mouth.

                         VIG
               We have to go back. We can't leave
               him there.

     Vig's mutilated right eye is bleeding.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We have to wait until it clears.

                         VIG
               You made the choice and we lost
               Troy --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I had no choice.

                         VIG
               You had a choice.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I had no fucking choice.

     He screams at Vig, who looks scared.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I can't walk away from a crime
               like that and take the gold and
               live my life like nothing
               happened, and if you can, then I
               hope you die right now.

     Vig starts crying. Doc hands a bandage to Archie, who puts it
     over Vig's wounded eye socket.

                         VIG
               What about Troy? What choice does
               he have now?

     PAN ACROSS the Man In Glasses wipes his daughter's face.

     EXT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     Iraqi soldiers strip Troy's clothes as he stands in front of
     Oasis Bunker surrounded only by fortress ruins in the desert.
     The Iraqi Interrogator pulls off his gas mask.

     Two Iraqi tanks are parked to the side. Small numbers of
     soldiers and civilians mill about.

                         IRAQI SOLDIER (SUBTITLES)
               Can we shoot him?

                         IRAQI SOLDIER #2 (SUBTITLES)
               We're not even supposed to have
               American prisoners.

                         INTERROGATOR (SUBTITLES)
               He's proof they broke the cease-
               fire.

     A GUN SHOT RINGS OUT. The Iraqis turn to look.

                         INTERROGATOR
               They're taking the tank.

     PAN TO 7 Shiites with rifles climb the unmanned Iraqi tank.
     4 Iraqi soldiers FIRE back at the Shiites.

     Troy, naked, tries to break away in the chaos. He runs a few
     feet, is tackled and dragged toward the bunker.

     EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE TANK

     Bill Smithson drives the motorcycle up and stops.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Start shooting, Paco.

                         WALTER
               I don't like this, we gotta go--

     Iraqi soldiers pull them off the motorcycle.

                         WALTER
               Hey.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Let me handle this.

     INT. NARROW CORRIDOR OF OASIS BUNKER

     Troy is led, naked, down the corridor by two soldiers.

     EXT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     Shiites rebels sit on top of the captured tank with rifles as
     it drives toward the bunker. Iraqi soldiers FIRE on them, but
     the turret aims at the bunker and FIRES -- blasting a hole.

     INT. BUNKER - CRUDE CEMENT BATHROOM - DAY

     Troy is thrown onto the floor of a cluttered cement bathroom
     with two crude toilets. His clothes are thrown on top of him.

                         IRAQI SOLDIER
               Get dress.

                         TROY
               OK.

                         IRAQI SOLDIER
               Get dress.

                         TROY
               I said OK.

     The door is slammed. Stolen blenders, radios, CDs, stacks of
     new Levis litter the floor. Troy kicks all the crap angrily
     and hundreds of cell phones tumble from a box.

     Troy looks at the pile of cell phones, picks one up, tries it
     for a dial tone, drops it, tries another, until he gets one
     that gives him a tone and dials.

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
               Jalam nafad.

     Troy looks stunned.

                         TROY
                      (into the cell phone)
               Um. Do you speak English?

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
                      (British accent)
               Yes.

                         TROY
                      (into cell phone)
               Can you -- I need --

     He frantically pushes stuff on the floor to block the door.

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
               What number, please.

                         TROY
               Operation Desert Storm.

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
               I'm sorry?

                         TROY
               The big army in the desert, come
               on, it's an emergency.

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
               I don't have that number.

                         TROY
               Maybe you could -- hello?

     The phone is dead.

                         TROY
               Fuck.

     He throws it to the ground, tries another, no dial tone,
     throws it, tries another, no dial tone, throws it.

                         TROY
               Come on, come on, come on.

     He tries another, chucks it, another, gets a dial tone,
     dials, and waits. Troy dials a number.

     He waits while the PHONE RINGS.

     INT. TROY'S HOME - TORRANCE, CAL.- NIGHT

     Darlene, Troy's wife, tired from the pregnancy, picks up the
     RINGING TELEPHONE. She has a crying baby in her arm.

     INTERCUT with bunker:

                         DARLENE
                      (Southern accent)
               Hello?

                         TROY
               Honey, it's me.

                         DARLENE
               Troy?

                         TROY
               It's me, honey.

                         DARLENE
               My God, the baby's crying.

                         TROY
               I can hear her.

                         DARLENE
               That's our little Krystal.

                         TROY
               How's she doing?

                         DARLENE
               She hasn't been sleeping good, and
               Mamma had to go back to work, so
               I'm real, real tired, baby.

                         TROY
               I wish I was there to help, gooney-
               bird.

                         DARLENE
               Oh, gooney-bird, when are you
               coming home?

                         TROY
               I'm working on that right now,
               baby.

                         DARLENE
               I saw an ad for a computer job.
               You want me to call and set up an
               interview for my war hero?

                         TROY
               Listen, honey --

                         DARLENE
               What date are you coming home?

                         TROY
               They haven't given us an exact
               date yet. Listen --

                         DARLENE
               I'm henpecking you.

                         TROY
               No, you're not.

                         DARLENE
               I'm lonely and tired and most of
               all, I miss you.

                         TROY
               I miss you, too.

     FIRE and CONCRETE EXPLODE into one wall of the bathroom.

                         DARLENE
               What was that?

                         TROY
               The wall just exploded.

                         DARLENE
               I thought the war was over, honey.

                         TROY
               It is and it isn't, babe. Can you
               do me a favor and call the C.O. on
               base?

                         DARLENE
               You want me to call the C.O.?

                         TROY
               Tell him I'm stuck in a bunker
               near 223 north outside Karbala --

                         DARLENE
               What do you mean 'stuck'? I
               thought the war was over.

                         TROY
               I'm gonna be fine, honey, I don't
               want you to worry, I tried to do
               something for the family,  and I
               want you to know --

                         DARLENE
               Know what?

     Another MORTAR SMASHES through the wall, covers Troy in dust.

                         TROY
               That I love you.

                         DARLENE
               What's happening, Troy?

                         TROY
               Tell Krystal --

     Soldiers push at the door, trying to open it.

                         DARLENE
               Troy?

                         TROY
               Tell Krystal I'm a rich man and if
               things work out she'll be taken
               care of no matter what --

                         DARLENE
               What are you talking about?

     The door is kicked open and soldiers enter.

                         TROY
               Gotta go, gooney-bird, I love you--

     The soldiers punch Troy in the face, drag him from the room.

                         DARLENE
               Troy?

     She waits for a moment, tears in her eyes, and hangs up.

     INT. TV ROOM OF OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     A MORTAR ROCKS THE ROOM; soldiers frantically exit.

     'CNN' is left playing in the empty room with Bill Smithson's
     report from the previous day. "I Just Want to Celebrate"
     PLAYS:

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Spirits are high and the music is
               soaring as these young troops
               celebrate --

     EXT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     Iraqi soldiers shoulder-launch a rocket at the tank,
     EXPLODING it. Soldiers shoot into the flaming wreck.

     PULL BACK TO Bill Smithson and PACO, the cameraman.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I'm being held captive by Iraqi
               troops in the gritty city of

                         PACO
               You said gritty city again.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               OK, we'll go again.

                         PACO
               What about Private Wogoman, Bill?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Let's lay a few of these down
               first. In three, two, and, I'm
               being held captive in a gritty
               suburb of Karbala, where Shiite
               fundamentalists are rising up --

     PAN TO Walter is stripped naked by Iraqi soldiers. Their
     CONVERSATION is in ARABIC and SUBTITLED in ENGLISH.

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               You better not let that fucking
               reporter see you doing this.

                         IRAQI SARGEANT
               Hey, that's the CNN guy.

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               Wow. He's much shorter in person.

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               Get them out of here now.

     LATER

     Walter sits on the bike, naked. Bill Smithson in the sidecar,
     Paco in the back. Iraqi soldiers pull the tape out.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               At least let me keep the tape.

                         WALTER
               Could I have my helmet, please?

     They hand him his socks.

                         WALTER
               Helmet. On my head.

     They give Walter his helmet, with built-in radio headset.

               I'm not breaking your balls, Doug,
               I want to find these guys.

     INT. TUNNEL - DAY

     Archie, Doc, Vig, and dozens of Shiites crouch as they walk
     through the tunnel, single file.

     Dissolve

     They are still walking in the long tunnel.

     EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY

     Archie climbs out of a small mound in the desert, squints in
     the light and looks around.

     A strange minaret stretches skyward from the flat desert, 200
     yards away. The minaret is made of yellow stone, it twists
     150 feet into the air, like a twisting wedding cake.

     Archie leads the others toward the minaret. No one is around,
     except for a few black robes. Archie, Doc, and Vig enter the
     old wooden doorway of the ancient Minaret.

     INT. MINARET HALLWAY - DAY

     A line of TEN CHILDREN with missing limbs and bandages stand
     and watch Archie, Doc, and Vig enter. They make eye contact.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     CLOSE UP: the hands of an Iraqi soldier carefully wrap a bare
     wire around Troy's right ear.

                      (heavy accent)
               What is your rank, bro?

                         TROY
               Master sargeant.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Your company?

                         TROY
               B Company, infantry, United States
               Army.

     The wire is wrapped under Troy's chin around his other ear.

                         INTERROGATOR
               My main man. Tell me something,
               OK? What is problem with Michael
               Jackson?

                         TROY
               What do you mean?

                         INTERROGATOR
               The King of Pop. 'I'm bad, I'm
               bad, you know it --'

                         TROY
               Yeah, Michael Jackson.

                         INTERROGATOR
               He is fahking the small boys, man.

                         TROY
               What are you talking about?

                         INTERROGATOR
               He come to Egypt with the small
               boys. I see picture in newspaper,
               always he is with the small boys
               in the hotel window. Hello with
               the white glove. I am King of Pop
               in my hotel with the small boys.
               No girls. Just the boys.

                         TROY
               He likes kids.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Yeah, he like to fahk them up the
               ass.

                         TROY
               Bullshit.

     Troy is smashed in the face with a clipboard.  He looks
     angry, and like he could cry at the same time.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You are the blind bullshit, my
               main man.  It is so obvious he
               like the small boy so he all the
               time travel with them.

                         TROY
               Fine.

                         INTERROGATOR
               And if it really true? You say --

                         TROY
               I say it's sick.

                         INTERROGATOR
               That's because you got a sick
               country, bro, you got no respect
               for the children. That's why you
               bomb them over here, right?

                         TROY
               I don't think so.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Michael Jackson is Pop King of
               sick fahking country.

                         TROY
               Wrong.

     Troy is smashed in the face with the clip board.  Blood drips
     from his nose.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Bullshit wrong, dude. A black man
               make the skin white and the hair
               straight. You know why?

                         TROY
               No.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Your sick fahking country make the
               black man hate hisself, just like
               you hate the Arab and the children
               you bomb.

                         TROY
               I don't hate children.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Do they care, buddy?

                         TROY
               Does who care?

                         INTERROGATOR
               Do your army care about the Shiite
               children? Do they come to help?

                         TROY
               No, they're not coming.

     The Interrogator signals someone O.S. and suddenly voltage
     races through the wire, causing Troy to gnash his teeth
     together so hard they chip. He writhes in pain.

                         INTERROGATOR
                      (in subtitles)
               That seemed like too much volts.
               You got to build it up slow.

     A SECOND IRAQI gestures defensively at a console that is
     connected to the wire around Troy's jaw.  A THIRD IRAQI
     reaches forward and turns a dial.  The SECOND IRAQI murmurs
     defensively and turns the dial back.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Just figure it out.

     The Interrogator turns back to Troy.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Are they coming to help the Shiite?

                         TROY
               No.

     He is jolted again -- his face contorts, he bites his lip.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Tell the truth, dudesky. Save us
               the big bummer.

     Troy starts to cry, represses it. His lip is bleeding.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Does it hurt?

     Troy says nothing.

                         INTERROGATOR
               I ask you question, bro.

                         TROY
               Yes, it hurts.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You bomb my family. Do you know
               that?

     Troy starts shaking slightly.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You blow up my home. The whole
               street. My wife is crush by big
               fahking block of concrete. She
               lose her legs, bro, and she got
               nice legs, too. Those legs cut off
               now.

     Emotion comes into the INTERROGATOR'S VOICE as he says this.

                         TROY
                      (whispers)
               That's horrible.

                         INTERROGATOR
               What?

                         TROY
                      (whispers)
               I said, that's horrible.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Oh, my God, buddy. I didn't even
               told you the horrible part yet.

     The other two guards listen sadly.

                         INTERROGATOR
               My son was kill in his bed. Did
               you heard that, dude?

                         TROY
               Yes.

                         INTERROGATOR
               He is one years old. He is
               asleeping with his toy doll when.
               the bomb come. You see that guy
               over there?  He lose his daughter
               same way: big USA bomb.

     CLOSE UP the two guards -- one of them wipes away a tear.

               about Krystal, my main man?

                         TROY
               Because we're both fathers.

                         INTERROGATOR

               remember? My son is dead now.

     INT. LARGE ROOM OF MINARET - DAY

     TWO DOZEN PEOPLE are laying down, being treated by SHIITE
     CLERICS in black who squeeze aloe onto facial blisters.

     At the end of the hall, Archie grits his teeth in pain as a
     CLERIC uses a turkey baster to shoot alcohol into his
     infected wound. Archie SCREAMS in pain.

     Doc paces, exhaling; he has white ointment on his face.

                         DOC
               I'm OK. I'm cool. I'm a survivor.

     A Shiite changes Vig's bloody bandage, while a DEAD BODY is
     laid next to Vig and wrapped in cloths; two clerics chant.

                         VIG
               Is that guy dead? Where you gonna
               put him?

                         SHIITE CLERIC
               A shrine.

                         VIG
               What kind of shrine ya'll got?

                         SHIITE CLERIC

               Hey, that's a pretty good shrine,
               right, Doc?

     Doc stares at Vig.

                         VIG
               I'm sorry I hit you, man. I was
               scared for Troy, I don't want

               friend. Doc? Come on, man, I know
               you was comin' to help me --

     Vig reaches out blindly for Doc's hand. Doc looks for a
     moment at Vig's hand in the air, reaching, then takes it.
     They remain silent for a moment, hands clasped.

                         VIG
               Maybe we got kicked out of the
               ring of Jesus fire, on account of
               stealing.

                         DOC
               That's not how it works.

               How does it work?

                         DOC
               I take care of what Jesus puts in
               front of me. That's what we did
               with the gold.

     Archie walks up, his arm bandaged, and inspects Vig's face.

     Archie, Doc, and Vig check the Vuitton suitcases, opening
     them, looking at the gold, shutting them.

     PAN TO children in bandages watch Archie inventory the gold.

     They look at Archie.

     Doc thinks.

               Where's that?

               Like 17 - 18 klicks from here.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Take us there.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               We got no wheels.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We'll walk until we find some.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Why don't you call in the Marines?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               With what? We don't have a radio.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               OK, we'll find a vehicle. You
               drive back to get the choppers,
               they fly in to get your man.

     Doc and Vig look at Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We can't do that.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Why not? You got a huge army here.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're not supposed to be involved
               with Shiites. We killed Iraqi
               soldiers. We broke the peace-
               accord.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Tell them it happened when you
               reclaimed the gold. Don't tell
               them it was about us.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They'd find out, we'd go to jail.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               You know what I think? I think
               maybe you're boosting the gold.
               That's what I think.

     Archie looks at him.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You're wrong.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               They got half a million men in the
               desert, they send four guys to
               pick up all this bullion? I don't
               think so.

     Archie looks at Vig and Doc.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We need to find our man. How much
               do you want to take us there?

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Fifteen suitcases.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's too much.

                         VIG
               Give it to him. We've got a lot.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're gonna need it to buy our way
               back today, so we better spend it
               wisely. I'll give you eight.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               You need some guns, right? You
               lost your gear.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Yeah, we need some guns.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               You need some fighters, too. I
               mean, you can try to take Oasis on
               your own, but look at these
               grunts --

     Doc and Vig look pissed. Archie's arm is in pain.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Yeah, OK, we need some fighters.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               So that's worth more than eight
               suitcases.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Ten.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Fifteen.

     Archie looks at him.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's four million dollars.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               I think we need it more than you,
               John Doe, don't you?

     He extends his hand. They shake.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Archie Gates.

                         IMAM (MAN IN GLASSES)
               Imam Katar. I'll give you back
               five suitcases to get us over the
               Iranian border.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What?

                         IMAM
               We gotta get to a refugee camp or
               we're dead. The camps are in Iran.

                         DOC
               We can't go to the Iranian border.

                         IMAM
               Then we don't have a deal.

                         VIG
               Give me a fucking break, man.

                         DOC
               We saved your life.

                         IMAM
               And we saved yours.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We lost a man for you.

                         IMAM
               What good is it if you leave us to
               get wasted? The big army of
               democracy beats the ugly dictator,
               saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you
               go to jail if you help us escape
               the same dictator.  You saw what
               happened to my wife. Look at my
               daughter.

     Archie looks around. He sees Imam's daughter, other bandaged
     children looking at him. A few mothers.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Who's going?

                         IMAM
               Everyone but the priests. That's
               55.

                         VIG
               Fuck it. We'll find this place on
               our own.

                         IMAM
               It's not on a map. You can look.

                         DOC
               Somebody else will take us.

     Doc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up

                         DOC
               Who will take us to Oasis bunker?

     Fifty Shiites turn and look at him silently. Doc dumps a
     whole suitcase of gold bars. Imam translates.

                         IMAM
               Jarat yalam fantam uraz.

     People stare at the gold and say nothing.

                         IMAM
               I don't think so.

                         VIG
               This is a human life we're talking
               about.

                         IMAM
                      (laughs)
               Tell me about it.

     His daughter looks at him and laughs -- until her laughter
     becomes scary, hysterical and Imam tries to hold her still
     and she won't stop as Archie, Doc, Vig watch.

     INT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     CLOSE ON -- Head of a golf clubdriver: "Made in USA."
     Interrogator holds the golf club near the head, paces.

                         INTERROGATOR
               I only join Saddam Hussein army to
               make good living for family, good
               car, good house, and now my son is
               dead.

                         TROY
               I signed up for the extra cash,
               too.

                         INTERROGATOR
               We got a lot in common, dude. I
               got training and guns from America.

                         TROY
               Not from America.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Oh, yeah, specialist guys come to
               Iraq, train us when we fight Iran.

                         TROY
               What did they train you in?

                         INTERROGATOR
               Weapons, sabotage. Interrogation.

                         TROY
               Great.

     The Interrogator lights a Marlboro, exhales.

     PUSH IN TO CLOSE UP on TROY'S FACE as the smoke envelopes him.

     FANTASY -- INT. TROY'S BEDROOM - TORRANCE

     Darlene looks up and beams as Troy walks into the room, they
     embrace on the bed.

                         INTERROGATOR (O.S.)
               So what we get from this dirty
               Iraq war you and me, huh?

     FANTASY - TROY

               I don't know.

     BACK TO SCENE

                         INTERROGATOR

               You don't fahking know, right?! We
               all scahmbag soldier who get
               fahked, right?

                         TROY
               Right.

     Interrogator laughs and takes a practice golf swing.

                         TROY
               So why are you doing this to me?

                         INTERROGATOR
               It's my job, man, for Saddam, just
               like your job when you bomb my
               house.

                         TROY
               It's not just a job, it still
               matters what you do.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Bullshit. It's all a job.

                         TROY
               It still matters what you do, what
               you're doing right now matters.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Bullshit.

                         TROY
               The art of war is not for killing
               people, it's a stratagem to give
               life to many with minimum
               violence, minimum --

                         INTERROGATOR
               Then why you bomb my fahking house
               and kill my son? Can you think how
               it feels inside your heart if I
               bomb your daughter?

     FANTASY - SLOW MOTION - A MISSILE

     silently destroys Troy's suburban house.

     BACK TO SCENE

                         TROY
               Worse than death --

                         INTERROGATOR
               It feels like this --

     Holding the driver at the head, he raps the bridge of Troy's
     nose.

                         TROY
               Don't --

                         INTERROGATOR
               Everyday, inside my heart --

     He raps Troy's nose repeatedly to make his point.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Like this, like this, like this --

     He breaks Troy's nose with a crack.

     INT. MINARET

     A rug is pulled off the old stone floor, a panel is lifted.
     Old pistols and rifles are pulled out.

     Doc and Vig load and handle the old pistols.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Did we save anything from the
               Humvee?

                         DOC
               This bag.

     Archie pulls two of the colored footballs from the beat up
     pack. He looks at Doc as if to say "Great."

     LATER

     Archie's arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of
     light blue plastic explosive around a football, presses small
     nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a fuse in the
     end of the ball. Another ball-bomb just like it has already
     been constructed.

     EXT. DESERT -  DAY

     Archie leads a line of 55 Shiites across the desert. Everyone
     carries at least one Vuitton bag. Imam carries his daughter.

                         VIG
               You got the same name as the tall
               model who does David Bowie.

                         DOC
               That's Im-an, with an 'n.' He's
               Imam with an 'm.'

                         VIG
               That's the same name.

                         DOC
               It's not the same name.

                         VIG
               Whatever. They're both attractive
               names.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     Archie crouches low to the ground, moving quickly,
     secretively. He turns and makes a hand signal to, Doc, 20
     yards away, who turns and makes a hand signal to Vig.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT: A lone Iraqi military truck, mint condition.'

     Archie, Vig, and Doc form a semicircle, surrounding the
     truck. They are all 40 yards back from the truck.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               This is the United States Army.
               Come out of the truck with your
               weapons in the air.

     No response. Suddenly Vig's pistol FIRES.

                         VIG
               Shit. Sorry.

     His gunshot blows a hole in the Iraqi truck -- which deflates
     like a huge beach ball, circling wildly until it lies in a
     heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while 50 yards away --
     55 SHIITES flip sand-colored blankets off and stand up in the
     desert to look. Doc lifts the limp canvass of the deflated
     truck.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They used a lot of decoys to throw
               off our bombers.

                         DOC
               Where are we gonna get a vehicle?

                         IMAM
               I know a place that's full of
               deserters. Maybe they got
               something.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT: They walk in a single file line in the
     desert.  Archie in front, carries a Vuitton bag.

     EXT. DESERTER'S BUNKER - DAY

     Archie now walks among Shiites toting old rifles. There are
     bomb craters, destroyed cars, a few mud dwellings nearby.

                         SHIITE
               America!

                         SHIITE #2
               America! Friend!

                         SHIITE
               Freedom! Thank you to America!

     Shiites cheer and pat Archie, Doc and Vig on the back as they
     walk to a bunker built into the side of a small hill. TWO
     IRAQI SOLDIERS come out smiling to embrace a disoriented
     Archie and Doc.

     INT. IRAQI BUNKER - DAY

     They pass through a cluttered room with six cots, down a
     hallway, to a larger room where two more YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIERS
     sit watching CNN. There is a defaced poster of Saddam, two
     peacocks and three monkeys in the room, and the half-eaten
     carcass of a zebra. The soldiers rise and half-bow to Archie.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER

     The Iraqi Soldier offers a live monkey to Archie.

               Water all gone. No one have water.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Radio?

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               No radio.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No radio, no water, but yes CNN.

     The other Iraqis nod their heads and laugh nervously.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
               George Bush get rid Saddam.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Not exactly.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
               Congratulation!

     He embraces Archie, who looks at Imam.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Would you explain to these
               gentlemen that we need a vehicle
               of some kind?

     INT. BUNKER GARAGE - DAY

     It is dark. With a click, several bare ceiling lights come
     on. Archie, Doc, Vig, stare in amazement: It's an underground
     garage filled with nine luxury cars: A ROLLS ROYCE, a JAGUAR,
     a MERCEDES, an INFINITI CONVERTIBLE, FOUR CADILLACS, a WHITE
     STRETCH LIMOUSINE. The friendly Iraqi smiles.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
               From Kuwait.

     Doc stops at the convertible.

                         DOC
               Could I ask a question?

     The Iraqi deserters look at him.

                         DOC
               Does Lexus make this model?

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
               No. Infiniti convertible only.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI 2
               No Lexus convertible.

                         DOC
               Exactly what I said.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Listen. We use these cars to go
               fight Saddam soldiers.

     The Friendly Iraqi looks at Doc and laughs.

                         DOC
               What's so funny?

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
               Cannot take.

                         DOC
               What do you mean, cannot take? We
               kicked Saddam's ass. We definitely
               take.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We are the United States military.

     The Iraqi laughs.

                         IMAM
               You're three guys with a bunch of
               Shiites and no Humvee.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER
               Need money. Have no money. To eat.
               To live. Kish falan azar yat imal
               tanat.

                         IMAM
               He says the Americans have many
               tanks, many airplanes. We have
               nothing.

     The Iraqis do not look happy. Imam does simultaneous
     translation as Archie holds forth.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We will rise up together.

                         IMAM
               Jihala vamat.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Rise up together.

     Doc and Vig look taken aback as Archie goes messianic.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Look at us. Working together. Many
               races, many nations. Tell him, Doc.

                         DOC
               We are united.

     They raise their joined hands together.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               United. George Bush wants YOU --

               You.

                         VIG
               Praise Jesus.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Make the fight for freedom on your

                         DOC
               Oh, yes, you can.

                         VIG
               Go, baby, go.

     Archie walks around, looking into the eyes of each Iraqi
     soldier, touching them on the shoulders.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Then America will follow.

                         IMAM
               Jahal yaqat.

                         DOC
               Jahal yaqat, brothers.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               God bless America, and God bless
               a free Iraq.

     Iraqis burst into cheers.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What do you say now, my friend?

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               Cannot give car.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Then I guess we'll have to buy
               them.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     The luxury cars ride across the desert, single file, Vuitton
     bags strapped to the roofs.

     INT. ROLLS ROYCE - DAY

                         VIG
               Judas Priest will pump you, Doc --

                         DOC
               I already had it with the Beach
               Boys today.

                         VIG
               One song.

     Doc slams in a CD-- TRADITIONAL IRAQI FOLK WAILING PLAYS.
     The Shiite riflemen in back smile as Vig scowls.

     INT. INFINITI

     Archie drives. Imam sits in passenger seat with his daughter
     on his lap. They listen to Iraqi music.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Shiites finish passing 92 Vuitton suitcases into a trench.
     The bags are buried. Archie drives a stake to mark the spot.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We get our man, we come back to
               pick up the gold --

                         IMAM
               And my people.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               My gold isn't here, and I mean all
               of it, your people will not
               survive.

     Doc and Vig pull off distributor caps from the Cadillacs and
     Limousine (but not the Jaguar) and put them in Doc's pack.

                         IMAM
               I understand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               OK. Let's load and go.

     Imam hugs and kisses his daughter goodbye and tries to put
     her, crying, into the arms of an older woman.

                         VIG
               Wait a second, I want to talk
               about this plan some more --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're going to drive in and get
               Troy, exactly like we discussed.

                         VIG
               I have a bad feeling like we're
               gonna get wasted.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You're scared. It's good to be
               scared when there's guns around.

     Vig looks uneasy. Archie hums Bach's 'Gloria' and moves a
     hand in the air, then puts his hands on Vig's shoulders and
     SINGS THE BACH LOUD. Vig eventually joins in the chorus.

                         DOC
               I'm cool. I'm all right.

     He lies down and breathes with a hand on his chest as Archie
     and Vig keep singing.

     EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY

     Bach's B Minor Mass plays as the Mercedes, Infiniti, and
     Rolls Royce Drive across the desert.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     The Interrogator finishes putting tissue in Troy's bleeding
     nose.

                         TROY
               Your son wouldn't be dead if
               Saddam didn't invade Kuwait.

     FANTASY - IRAQI SOLDIERS

     smash the windows of a Benneton store, then a Cartier store.

                         INTERROGATOR (O.S.)
               I know.

                         TROY (O.S.)
               I heard about some bad shit that
               happened there.

     FANTASY - IRAQI SOLDIERS

     drag patients from their hospital beds and AN IRAQI SOLDIER
     dives on top of a crying NURSE and starts to rape her while
     a BABY is taken from an incubator, which is stolen.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

                         TROY
               Who's got the sick country?

                         INTERROGATOR
               Maybe Saddam is very crazy, right?
               And then you are crazy to bomb all
               of Iraq.

                         TROY
               Too much bombing is crazy, but not
               saving Kuwait.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You come here to save Kuwait
               people?

                         TROY
               Yes.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Really?
                      (to the Second Iraqi)
               Jahaza fan.

     The Second Iraqi dips a bucket into an oil drum.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Lots of people in trouble around
               this world, my man. You don't
               fight no fahking war for them.

                         TROY
               You invaded another country. You
               can't do that.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Why not, dude?

                         TROY
               It makes the world crazy. You got
               to keep it stable.

                         INTERROGATOR
               For what? Your pick up truck?

                         TROY
               No, for stability. Stabilize the
               region.

     The Interrogator pulls a CD from Troy's pocket and jams it
     into Troy's mouth.

                         INTERROGATOR
               This is your fahking stability, my
               main man.

     The Interrogator uses the CD as a funnel to force-feed the
     crude oil into Troy's mouth as he pours it from the bucket.

     EXT. RIM OF DUNE OVERLOOKING OASIS BUNKER

     Archie, Doc, Vig, stand on a sand ridge and look down on the
     Oasis bunker in the distance. Behind them are the three cars,
     Imam, and a handful of Shiite gunmen. They get into the cars.

     EXT. DUNES

     An empty ridge. The Infiniti, Rolls, Mercedes shoot over it,
     arcing down toward the bunker, engines roaring.

     EXT. OASIS BUNKER

     It is quiet. A Slim Jim is unwrapped as an IRAQI GUARD slowly
     raises it to his mouth, bites it, chews, and looks puzzled at
     the cars approaching in the distance.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT - looking straight down.

     The cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the
     bunker. The Infiniti is in the middle, flanked by the Rolls
     on the left and the Mercedes on the right.

     INT. INFINITI

     Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward
     the bunker. A Shiite sits up front with him. Fifty yards from
     the bunker, Vig turns sharply and drives in circles.

     EXT. BUNKER

     TWO IRAQI GUARDS, one chewing a Slim Jim, look bewildered as
     they stare at the circling Infiniti fifty yards away.

     INT. MERCEDES

     Archie, with Imam in the passenger seat, two Shiites in back,
     speeds the Mercedes past the guards, around the right side,
     to the back side of the bunker, skidding across the sand.

     AERIAL VIEW

     The Mercedes and the Rolls diverge around the bunker on
     either side: Rolls on the left, Mercedes on the right.

     INT. ROLLS ROYCE

     Doc drives the Rolls around the left, to the bunker's rear.

     EXT. BUNKER

     Iraqi soldiers fire a grenade that blows up right behind the
     Rolls as Doc skids right up to a rear entrance of the bunker,
     the grill touching the metal door. Doc parks, blockading the
     rear door shut, and, with three Shiite riflemen, jumps out.

     INT. INFINITI

     A Shiite helps Vig wedge a piece of wood onto the gas pedal.
     Vig suddenly grabs his hand in PAIN. The Shiite looks at him.

                         VIG
               Splinter.

                         SHIITE
               Come on.

     EXT. INFINITI

     Vig and the Shiite bail out of the moving Infiniti. Wads of
     plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it
     speeds towards the bunker, then drifts to the side --

                         VIG
               Go straight, go straight --

     He jumps up and down and points, but the Infiniti goes far to
     the side of the bunker and explodes into some ruins. The two
     guards point their guns at Vig and the Shiite and they run
     into the desert as bullets pop around them.

     EXT. RIGHT SIDE OF BUNKER

     Archie skids the Mercedes to a halt on the right side of the
     bunker, jumps out, slams the door, followed by Imam and the
     two other Shiites.

     They run toward the bunker, Archie with a wad of plastic
     explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in
     the other. He HEARS the CHIRP of a car alarm being activated
     as he runs to the bunker.

     Imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker, pulls
     off a grill. Archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic
     explosive, and drops it into the vent.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Troy gags and spits, his front is covered in oil. The
     Interrogator raises the bucket.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Are you feeling stable enough for
               more?

     An EXPLOSION elsewhere in the bunker causes the lights to
     flicker out.

     INT. BUNKER CORRIDOR

     Iraqi soldiers scurry in the darkness with flashlights. They
     go to the rear door, pile up in the dark, pushing.

     EXT. REAR OF BUNKER

     The parked Rolls Royce blockades the rear door.

     EXT. SIDE OF BUNKER

     Archie and Imam run back to the Mercedes, but the car is
     locked, his pistol sits inside on the front seat. A GUNSHOT
     from the bunker roof shatters the window of the Mercedes,
     setting off THE CAR ALARM.

     Archie reaches in, grabs his pistol, and bolts as a launched
     grenade blows the Mercedes.

     EXT. FRONT OF BUNKER - DAY

     12 Iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as 3 Shiite
     riflemen with Doc fire on them. Two Iraqis go down, with only
     the sound of bullets piercing their flesh.

     6 Iraqis run for it, into the desert. 2 Iraqis throw their
     hands up in surrender while 2 look ambivalent, one holds a
     stack of new Levis. Doc raises a hand to stop his Shiite
     gunmen from firing, but they fire anyway and 3 Iraqis fire
     back -- the Shiite next to Doc is hit in the face.

                         DOC
               Stop shooting, what's the matter
               with you?

     He reaches out and holds the rifle of a Shiite. Everyone
     stops firing, slowly the Iraqis drop their guns. Doc has WET
     HIS PANTS.

     Archie runs up from the right, grabs Doc's arm and they run
     past surrendering Iraqi soldiers and into the front entrance.
     of the bunker. Imam takes cover on the side of the bunker
     while Shiites and Iraqis aim at each other.

     Vig approaches cautiously from the desert, HEARS AN AIRCRAFT,
     and looks up. An Iraqi helicopter comes in fast and opens
     FIRE with MACHINE GUNS --

                         VIG
               Shit.

     Vig runs toward the bunker for cover, but is cut off by
     MACHINE GUN FIRE from THE CHOPPER. Shiites FIRE rifles up at
     the chopper.

     INT. IRAQI CHOPPER

     Chips of metal and plastic fly off as bullets hit the
     chopper. Arabic chatter is heard over a crackling radio.

     POV - FROM INSIDE THE CHOPPER

     100 feet below -- Vig and six remaining Shiite riflemen are
     running into the desert away from the chopper.

     EXT. DESERT -  DAY

     Vig and the six Shiites frantically search for cover.

     The chopper FIRES and one of the Shiites running with Vig is
     hit in the head, thrown by the force of the gunshot into Vig,
     who goes down, faking it.

     Vig lies face down, out of breath, with the dead Shiite on
     top of him while the chopper hovers above.

                         VIG
               Jesus God, I don't wanna get hit,
               please Jesus, watch over me --

     INT. BUNKER

     It is dimly lighted by a few mounted emergency lights.

     Archie and Doc run down the empty stairs, through the big
     main room -- it is empty. Archie goes down the right side,
     kicks open a door --

     It's the bathroom full of stolen stuff and cell phones --

     Doc goes down the left side of the room -- kicks in a door --
     a room full of Benneton sweaters in all colors.

     Archie kicks in a door -- a room with shelves full of large
     snow globes, thousands of them.

     Doc kicks in a door -- a room cluttered with debris, but
     there is another door at the far side of the room. He
     approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.

     Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency
     light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi
     torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the
     emergency light with a screwdriver --

     In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely
     in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN
     POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.

     Archie turns to the Interrogator, who stands next to Troy.

                         INTERROGATOR
               It's OK, buddy, we are just
               talking now --

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Archie shoots the Interrogator in the
     thigh. THE ONLY SOUND IS GUN SHOOTING, FLESH TEARING --

     Blood thinly splatters across Troy's face as the Interrogator
     grimaces and falls to the floor. The light flicks on a few
     beats, then off a few beats.

     Archie rips the wires from the table controls, goes to Troy,
     unhinges the wire from his jaw.

     The Interrogator writhes in pain on the ground. Archie takes
     the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord
     binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol.

     Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears. He gets up, looks
     down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into
     the Interrogator's face.

     The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back. Archie
     watches, out of breath. Troy FIRES the gun just to the side
     of the Interrogator's face, into the ground. The Interrogator
     looks terrified, crying. Troy stares back, looks unhappy,
     lowers the gun.

     Troy and Archie look at each other for an intense moment.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Let's go.

     INT. ANOTHER BUNKER ROOM

     Doc shoots the lock on the inner door and it finally opens.
     He looks inside and sees, in a sunken room, 50 more Shiite
     civilians huddled together. Archie rushes by with Troy.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Come on.

     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     Archie and Troy run out of the bunker --

     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     The chopper hovers right there. It FIRES A GRENADE which
     EXPLODES next to Archie and Troy. They scramble back into the
     bunker.

     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     Archie and Troy run into Doc at the door, knocking him over.
     They crouch inside the door; the chopper hovers low outside.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands
     and knees with the dead Shiite on his back.

                         VIG
               You gotta be my disguise, Mr.
               Shiite, cuz they need my help over
               there --

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     The six Iraqis who took oft from the bunker are still
     running. Their CONVERSATION is in ARABIC and SUBTITLED in
     ENGLISH.

                         TOUGH IRAQI
               Let's go back and get them.

                         IRAQI #2
               Fuck a donkey, no way.

                         TOUGH IRAQI
               There's a chopper, we can do it.

     He and another Iraqi stop while the other two keep running.

                         TOUGH IRAQI
               They killed your families, you
               fucking cowards.

     The Tough Iraqi and his partner, sweating profusely, out of
     breath, split up and head back toward the bunker.

     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     Archie's in great pain. He grimaces as he tightens the
     bandage around his forearm. Troy is shaking uncontrollably.
     Doc grabs Troy's shoulders firmly.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're gonna get out of here alive,
               just do what I say, do you hear me?

     Troy nods. Archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in
     C-4 from his small pack, and hands it to Doc.

     Archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Step, throw, one-two -- I'm gonna
               give it a five second fuse. That
               gives you two steps out the door.

     PAN ACROSS Troy and Doc listen intently.

     Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.

     The three of them stand at the door, ready. Archie holds his
     pistol ready. Doc holds the football, Troy holds the lighter.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Wait --

     EXT. BUNKER

     Imam, lying in a ditch, is concealed on the side of the
     bunker, and aims an old rifle at the chopper.

     GUNSHOTS ring off the side of the chopper, chipping plastic.
     The chopper banks toward Vig in response.

     Vig watches the chopper turn toward him.

                         VIG
               God help me.

     INT. BUNKER

     Troy flicks the lighter and with a shaking hand tries to
     light the fuse. Archie steadies Troy's hand. The fuse is lit.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Go.

     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     Archie FIRES his pistol as he goes out the door with Troy,
     also FIRING a pistol. Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning.
     Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up.

     INT. CHOPPER

     The chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the
     plexiglas window and bounces off, not exploding. The pilots
     look perplexed. The ball hits the ground and EXPLODES.

     EXT. BUNKER

     Archie, Troy, Doc, stunned -- turn back to the bunker.

     INT. BUNKER DOORWAY - DAY

     They run inside and take cover, catch their breath. Troy and
     Doc look terrified.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               OK.  Shorter fuse this time.

     He pulls out the second ball, cuts another fuse, affixes it.
     They wait at the door again, watching the chopper.

     EXT. BUNKER

     Imam, from the side of the bunker, FIRES again, the chopper
     swivels toward him to RETURN FIRE --

     INT. BUNKER

     Troy lights the second fuse. They bolt out the door, Troy and
     Archie FIRING pistols, Doc in the middle with the ball.

     EXT. BUNKER

     SLOW TO FREEZE FRAME MID-STRIDE -- with just THE SOUND OF THE
     CHOPPER: Archie, Doc, Troy, three abreast, mid-stride.

     RESUME REGULAR SPEED -- Doc unleashes the football.

     PAN TO - SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- the ball hits the chopper
     broadside and THE CHOPPER EXPLODES INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: The chopper comes crashing to the
     ground in a heap of metal. The rotary spins off, whips over
     Archie, Troy, and Doc's heads and smashes into the bunker.

     Silence.

     Troy and Doc look at each other, and punch their fists
     together. Troy notices that he's wet his pants.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're not done. Check every Iraqi
               here.

     Archie rolls over bodies lying on the ground, pulls out their
     weapons. Troy and Doc take rifles from wounded Iraqis.

                         TROY
                      (agitated)
               Where's Conrad?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Don't let your guard down.

     Doc nervously scans the area with his pistol pointed.

     50 Shiite prisoners start streaming out of the bunker.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Stay there, don't move.

     Imam directs the Shiites to stay clustered near the bunker.

                         IMAM
               Jakar yizam ut naral --

                         TROY
               How are we getting back?

                         DOC
               We got the Rolls.

     An IRAQI SOLDIER jumps up just as Archie knocks him to the
     ground from behind and twists the gun away. Doc binds the
     soldier's hands with a plastic cuff.

                         TROY
               You got a Rolls?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It's been a busy day.

     Archie pulls pistols from the bloody bodies of the two Iraqis
     in the chopper.

                         TROY
               Hey. That's a convertible.

     He points to the flaming wrecked Infiniti.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Keep your fucking guard up.

                         TROY
               Is that leather interior?

                         DOC
               I think he's in shock.

                         TROY
               It's a fucking Infiniti
               convertible, isn't it?

                         DOC
               Yes.

                         TROY
               OK. So I owe you a car. I'm not in
               shock.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We can talk about cars later, OK?

                         TROY
               Freeze --

     He points his pistol at Imam.

                         IMAM
               Take it easy.

                         TROY
               Who is this guy?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               He's with us.

     Troy and Imam look at each other a moment, Troy still points
     his pistol at Imam.

                         TROY
               You're the guy with the little
               girl.

                         IMAM
               That's right.

                         TROY
               What are you doing here?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               He helped us find you.

                         TROY
               All right. You're all right.

     He hugs Imam.

                         TROY
               How's your girl?

                         IMAM
               She's safe. For the moment.

                         TROY
               All right. Excellent. How can we
               help?

                         DOC
               Calm down, man.

                         TROY
               I'm calm. Don't I look calm?

                         IMAM
               We had a deal to get us to the
               border, but we need more vehicles
               for these people.

     Troy moves nervously.

                         TROY
               We're gonna work it out. We can do
               it. We have to work it out.

                         DOC
               I'm not sure how. This is a lot of
               people.

                         TROY
               OK, you choose who we take. You
               tell the others it's not
               convenient, they'll have to die.

                         DOC
               Take it easy, man.

                         TROY
               You think I don't know what I'm
               saying. I know what I'm saying.
               We're gonna do more than steal,
               that's what I'm saying. We're
               gonna help these people out.

                         IMAM
               This guy was worth saving.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               He's a soldier.

     Troy and Archie look at each other, smile slightly.

                         VIG (O.S.)
               Yes. Yes. All right.

     They all turn to look.

     WIDE SHOT -- Vig pops up in the desert, 150 yards away.

                         VIG
               You made it.

     Vig comes running.

                         VIG
               I thought that was you. Yeah.

     Troy smiles as he steps in the direction of Vig. Suddenly a
     RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY
     THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is
     jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering
     toward Troy, 125 yards away.

     Troy looks stunned.

     Archie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle.

     An IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground
     as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire.

     Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cover him.

     Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie
     scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Lock it down. Shoot anything that
               moves.

                         IMAM
                      (translates)
               Haza janav yasat.

     Troy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and
     embraces him. Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's
     shoulder, as Vig tries to talk.

                         VIG
               You made it, man --

     Troy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms.

                         TROY
               Help him.

     Doc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the
     ground, cradling his head in his lap. Vig spits blood.

                         VIG
               What happened to the Jesus fire,
               Doc?

                         DOC
               It's around you right now, man, it
               works on this side or the other
               side.

                         VIG
               You never told me that part. I
               guess I could go to one of them
               shrines that erase the bad you
               did --

                         TROY
               We made the right choice today,
               Conrad.

                         VIG
               We did good, right?

                         TROY
               We made the right choice.

     The hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. Troy puts
     his hands over it. Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to
     turns Vig's head to help him breathe.

                         DOC
               Dear Lord watch over this man,
               help him if you can. Our father
               who art in heaven --

     50 Shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near
     the bunker watch from afar.

     Troy stands up looking around helplessly.

                         TROY
               Help.

                         DOC
               -- hallowed be thy name, thy
               kingdom come, thy will be done --

     A gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy
     in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches
     over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the
     sound of tearing tissue. Troy looks stunned as he is spun
     around by the shot.

     Archie spins around in the desert and looks at Troy.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Goddamn it.

     He runs hard across the desert toward Troy.

     Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other.

     Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great
     difficulty -- RASPING.

     INT. TROY'S RIB CAGE

     His breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to
     the left side.

     TROY'S POV

     looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but
     there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING

     The POV turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing.

     FLASHBACK TO THE OPENING SCENE, but with weird, MUFFLED
     SOUND

                         SOLDIER #5
               Take my picture.

                         VIG
               Do you still want to sell pictures?

                         TROY
                      (distracted monotone)
               For twenty.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Twenty bucks?

                         VIG
               War's been over five days, ain't
               gonna be any more of this, Jim.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Twenty dollars, man, what's the
               meaning of life?

                         TROY
               You're lucky you got to see
               anybody shot in this war.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Bobby, take my picture.

     He holds the camera out.

                         SOLDIER #4
               If he shot the guy, it's up to him.

                         SOLDIER #5
               It's not like he shot a fucking
               deer. It's the enemy.

                         VIG
               It's Troy's enemy, yours for
               twenty.

     BACK TO THE SCENE - CLOSE UP

     Troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide.

     TROY'S POV

     Archie and Imam step into frame. Archie looks down at Troy,
     opens his waist pack, pulls out a sterile wrapped scalpel.

     TROY'S POV TURNS TO THE SIDE --

     FISH EYE LENS - The Jaguar pulls up in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.

     Imam's Little Girl gets out of the passenger side, SLIGHTLY
     SLOW MOTION, NO SOUND. Imam scolds her and gesticulates,
     indicating she should be back with the others where it is
     safe. The Little Girl embraces Imam and stares down at Troy
     over her father's shoulder.

     EXT. DESERT

     Troy's eyes are wide, staring up at the Girl as he has great
     difficulty breathing. Archie rolls Troy's shirt up, exposing
     Troy's chest, with the bullet wound. Archie points to a spot
     on Troy's upper chest, near the collar bone --

     Doc squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel onto this
     spot -- the only sounds are the squirt of the ointment and
     Troy's breathing.

     Archie looks nervous, then focussed as he brings the shiny
     metal scalpel down. Troy is in great pain as he watches
     Archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest. Archie twists
     the scalpel to open the incision wide --

     There is a pronounced HISSING as trapped air rushes out. Huge
     relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally.

     Regular sound FADES BACK IN, THE FIRST SOUND IS THE GIRL'S
     THIN, INTERMITTENT HUMMING --

     TROY'S POV FROM THE GROUND, LOOKING UP

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I've been waiting 18 years to get
               that right.

     He tears open a short I.V. tube and plunges the I.V. into the
     scalpel hole. There is a small valve on the end of the tube,
     which he tightens.

     A GUNSHOT SOUNDS -- Archie turns and looks over --

     EXT. DESERT

     FIVE SHIITE RIFLE MEN chase down and shoot, at 30 yards, the
     last Iraqi gunner in the desert.

     Troy sits up slowly and watches for a moment.

     EXT. FRONT OF THE BUNKER - LATER

     Shiite women and children chant and pray around Vig's corpse
     as it lies in the open trunk of the Jaguar. Archie, Troy and
     Doc stand together watching. Troy and Doc do a muted version
     of Vig's Karate arm dance as they look down at his corpse.

                         TROY
               He's got no family.

     Archie sadly takes Vig's big pistol from Vig's clenched hand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're his family now.

                         DOC
               He wanted to go to one of those
               shrines.

                         IMAM
               Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.

     Archie takes Vig's glasses off.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Good. Take him.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     Archie fills a single rusted oil drum with gold bars and
     tapes it shut. Troy sits in a folding chair nearby. He looks
     pained and uncomfortable.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Air pressure will build up about
               every fifteen minutes. Release the
               valve, close it up again.

     Archie unscrews the valve on the tube in Troy's chest, and
     air hisses out. Troy looks relieved. Archie closes the valve.

                         TROY
               How long can I keep doing this?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Maybe four hours, if you're not
               bleeding too bad inside.

                         TROY
               I'm really thirsty.

                         DOC
               There's no water anywhere.

                         IMAM
                      (to Archie)
               I got you hooked up if you want to
               call your man.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     Archie operates a radio hooked up to a car battery.

                         ARCHIE GATES
                      (into the radio)
               Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do
               you read me?

                         DOC
               We're gonna be court-martialed.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No, we're not.

     Troy watches, tense.

                         ARCHIE GATES
                      (into the radio)
               Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are
               you reading this?

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Walter drives the motorcycle, nude, wearing his helmet with
     radio attachment. Smithson and Paco ride along.

     Archie is heard in a crackling radio transmission inside
     Walter's helmet. Walter speaks into the small mouthpiece.

                         WALTER
                      (into radio)
               This is Tar Baby, come in.

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               Where are you?

                         WALTER
                      (into radio)
               About two clicks outside camp.

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               We're about ready for the briar
               patch, over.

                         WALTER
                      (into the radio)
               Right.

     He looks uncertain, worried.

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               You got me, Tar Baby?

                         WALTER
               I think so -- who handles the
               briar patch?

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               You do.

                         WALTER
               Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to
               the briar patch if everything's
               OK, right?

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               No, the other way around.

                         WALTER
               Shit, I'm sorry, sir, I don't
               remember how the code goes --

     INTERCUT WITH Archie, who looks exasperated. He is sweating
     with a fever and his arm hurts.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Six personnel trucks and a Humvee.

                         WALTER
               Wow. That's a tall order for a
               secret operation, sir.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Talk to my friend Hash. Each
               driver will get 100K.

                         WALTER
               Did you say 100K?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North.
               Add one medavac pack to the order,
               and dump the reporter.

                         WALTER
               Roger. Give me two hours.

     INT. COMPANY B RADIO TENT - DAY

     TWO DECODERS sit at a table wearing headphones. One writes
     down: "BRER RABBIT AT 239 NORTH, DUMP THE REPORTER."

     INT. BUNKER - DAY

     CLOSE UP A SNOW GLOBE is shaken and little green dollars
     swirl inside the little world, settling upon an early desert
     oasis, old buildings, palm trees, donkeys, Three Kings,
     peasants carrying the baby Jesus, and a Mobil gas station.

     WIDER TO REVEAL HUNDREDS OF SNOW GLOBES are pulled from the
     shelves and put into old cloth bags.

     EXT. BUNKER - DAY

     Doc cracks open a snow globe with pliers as all the water and
     dollars drain out. Imam filters the water through a cheese
     cloth held above an urn.

     CLOSE ON the plastic Three Kings and Baby Jesus with the
     Mobil gas station glisten in the wet palm of Archie's hand.

     Archie looks at the Three Kings in his hand.

     Troy cracks open a snow globe, filters water with a Shiite.

     Dozens of Shiites are doing the same.

     Archie passes an urn to some parched Shiites who drink the
     water thirstily. Troy, Doc do the same.

     EXT. B COMPANY RADIO TENT - DAY

     Captain Van Meter, General Horn, and two radio decoders stand
     looking at logs of transmissions.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               There's so many transmissions --

                         GENERAL HORN
               Narrow it down to what sounds like
               Archie Gates and a Humvee.

     A Humvee with HAVICHON and Walter drives by behind the
     oblivious General, leading a convoy of several trucks.

                         GENERAL HORN
               I want a direction, we're not
               gonna comb the whole goddamn
               desert --

     A PRIVATE runs up and hands General Horn a paper.

                         PRIVATE
               This is from Barlow's C.O. at Fort
               Bragg, something with his wife.

                         GENERAL HORN
                      (reads)
               Fort Bragg? I'll be damned.

     Walter and Hash drive past Smithson and Paco and Cathy.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Where the hell is he going now?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               I say we keep watching the General.

     She takes off and Smithson follows her.

     EXT. DESERT -  DAY

     Imam pours gasoline on a pile of Vuitton suitcases,
     Troy throws a match, the suitcases go up in a rush of fire.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     Imam hands two gold bars to a Shiite peasant, who takes them
     and moves on. There are two long lines of Shiite peasants
     patiently waiting to get their gold, as it is handed out by
     Imam and another Shiite while, Archie, Troy, and Doc watch.
     Shiites stash their gold bars inside their clothing and bags.

     LATER

     Everyone sits and waits: Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his
     daughter, 105 Shiite peasants.

     Troy looks pained, then releases the valve on the tube
     sticking through his chest bandage and there is a hiss of
     air. He looks relieved.

     There is the SOUND OF DISTANT MOTORS RUMBLING. An approaching
     convoy in the desert: six open U.S. personnel trucks, led by
     a Humvee.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, dozens of Shiites
     watch the convoy approaching -- they hold their guns ready.

     The U.S. Military trucks and the Humvee pull up to the bunker.

     Walter stands in the front of the Humvee with Hash, both
     wearing sand goggles as they pull up -- Walter salutes.

                         HAVICHON
               Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got
               yourself shot.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Those better be words of sympathy.

     6 ARMY DRIVERS, among them the disillusioned infantrymen
     interviewed by Bill Smithson earlier, get out of their
     vehicles, greeted by Doc, Archie, and Imam.

     Walter walks up, carrying a medical pack.

                         WALTER
               Watcha doing out here, Troy?

     They bang fists in greeting.

                         TROY
               Protecting the free peoples of the
               world, Walter, you know how it is.

                         WALTER
               We better get you fixed up to go
               home to the land of the brave.

     Walter pushes an I.V. needle into Troy's arm.

                         TROY
               Give me that penicillin, baby.

     Doc pushes an I.V. needle into Archie's arm and tapes the
     penicillin sack to Archie's shirt.

                         HAVICHON
               Where ees bullion at, my man?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Bullion ees buried. I'll show you
               after we get these people to the
               border.

                         HAVICHON
               Iranian border?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Part of the deal.

                         HAVICHON
               C'est super, Archie, you got
               yourself a pain in the ass mission
               of mercy.

                         WALTER
               Sorry I fucked up the code, sir.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It means we gotta move. They might
               be coming for us.

     Bach's "Gloria" plays powerfully.

     Shiites pile into the six open trucks. The lone oil can full
     of gold is loaded, as well. Imam and his daughter are helped
     into a truck by Doc. Archie whistles loud from the front seat
     of the Humvee -- which leads the way as the convoy pulls out.

     Doc, in the back of a truck with Shiites, waves.

     Troy smiles as he sits in the back of a crowded truck with
     Imam, his daughter, and other Shiites.

     HIGH, WIDE CURVING HELICOPTER SHOT

     The six truck convoy, led by the Humvee, rolls across the two-
     lane desert road.

     EXT. BASE CAMP - B COMPANY - DAY

     SIX APACHE CHOPPERS are ROARING on the ground as Captain Van
     Meter, his White Assistant, and General Horn board a chopper.
     Smithson, Paco, and Cathy and her CAMERA MAN rush aboard the
     last chopper in the line.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     The Humvee slows to a halt.

     Archie stands in the front of the Humvee with a rifle at his
     side -- looking straight ahead -- concerned. Troy, Doc, Imam,
     and daughter stare ahead, concerned

     EXT. THE IRANIAN BORDER

     50 yards ahead -- a low wall of razor wire.

     100 yards beyond it, dozens of Iraqi tanks are lined up along
     the border, 100 feet apart, stretching into the distance
     either way. There are 50 IRAQI GROUND TROOPS standing at the
     border station, marked by razor wire on the one-lane road.

     On the far side of the border, IRANIAN SOLDIERS with RELIEF
     WORKERS wearing RED CRESCENTS wait by white school buses and
     stare at the American convoy.

     EXT. IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER

     Archie stares at the border, thinking.

     Imam helps Troy down from the truck. Doc carries the Little
     Girl.

                         HAVICHON
               What are you seenking?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I see an opening we can walk
               through. But it's not wide enough
               for a truck.

     Archie gets out of the Humvee and looks at the border.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We'll walk them to the border. The
               Iranians will take them. We'll
               walk back to the trucks and get
               out of here.

     Doc turns and signals to the drivers to come up.

     Troy takes the safety off his M-16.

     5 U.S.Drivers get out with their rifles ready. They release
     the safeties. Havichon, with his leg in a cast, stays back to
     man the mounted machine gun on the Humvee. Iraqi soldiers on
     the border nervously watch the Americans and the Shiites,
     holding their machine guns.

     INT. IRAQI TANK - DAY

     POV THROUGH IRAQI GUN SIGHT -- cross hairs pan from Doc, to
     Troy, to Imam, to Archie.

     EXT. BORDER

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Make a close group.

                         IMAM
                      (translates)
               Jihad yamat -- yamat.

     105 Shiites empty the trucks and gather in a crowd that walks
     toward the border. Two Shiite men carry Vig's body, wrapped
     in Arabic cloths.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, lead the crowd single file through a
     narrow opening in the razor wire. On the other side, the
     crowd spreads out and keeps walking. Archie, Troy, and Doc
     walk three abreast, 7 feet apart, rifles ready.

     Imam and Walter are behind, flanking them.

     FACES: CLOSE DOLLY - SHIITE Children, Women, Men, as they
     fearfully walk toward the border. The five U.S. Drivers flank
     the Shiites on either side, rifles ready.

     PAN TO - Troy suddenly drops to one knee.

                         DOC
               Let the air out.

                         TROY
               It's not the air, I don't know
               what it is --

                         DOC
               Stay back.

                         TROY
               I'm all right. I'm just dizzy or
               something --

     EXT. IRAN SIDE OF THE BORDER

     Iranian soldiers and relief workers stand watching.

     PAN AROUND TO - IRANIAN SIDE POV

     The backs of the Iraqi troops and tanks, and the approaching
     Shiites and Americans, walking in the distance.

     EXT. IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER

     Archie helps Troy as they walk three abreast with Doc.

     CHOPPERS ARE HEARD in the distance. They grow LOUDER. Imam
     turns and looks back. Archie turns around and looks.

     SIX APACHE CHOPPERS approach from the distance

     CLOSE DOLLY Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Double time.

     He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy
     cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others.
     The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and
     Walter look up also. Archie does not.

     Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the
     choppers as they pass overhead, loud.

     PAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in
     the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his
     path, blowing up dust.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the
     blowing sand.

     10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers,
     followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles.

     Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively.

     M.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from
     the Shiites.

     Troy shouts over the choppers.

                         TROY
               Wait.

     U.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border.

     The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward
     the border unaccompanied by American protection.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Let them get over the border.

     Troy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest.

                         TROY
               Let them get over, wait --

     Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back.

                         TROY
               I have to reach this --

     Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Put his cuffs in front.

     He and Doc are pulled away from Troy.

     Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them,
     throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at
     this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is
     thrown to the ground and dragged.

                         TROY
               Look what's happening.

     He collapses to one knee.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Not our mission, Barlow.

     Troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs
     prevent him from releasing his valve. Troy struggles.

                         TROY
               Cut my cuffs --

     Captain Van Meter leans down to Troy. He shouts over the
     choppers.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               You fucked me and you're fucked
               now, so shut your goddamn mouth.

     Shiites are lined up in a firing squad.

                         DOC
               He's gonna die.

     Troy lies on the ground suffocating. Archie drags the MP
     holding him as he goes to General Horn.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical
               attention, don't let him die --


                         GENERAL HORN
               We are not involved in the Shiite
               problem, do you understand
               me? You are AWOL, you are a
               fugitive, you are under arrest.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cut his cuffs.

     General Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground,
     concerned.

     A US SOLDIER stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in
     his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade,
     crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing
     by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with
     difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes.

     Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border.

     Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's
     body is dropped in the sand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We got the gold.

                         GENERAL HORN
               What?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We got the Kuwaiti bullion.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Bullshit.

     Archie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward
     the lead truck -- where MPs grab and wrestle him down.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Pull that barrel.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Pull it.

     An MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold
     bars spill to the sand.

     The General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody,
     watch.  The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers --
     and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET.

     THE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in
     custody -- stand and watch Archie.

                         GENERAL HORN
               How much do you have?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               4 tons.

     General Horn picks up a gold brick.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Where's it at?

                         TROY
               Get them over first.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They helped us get it, Ron. I made
               a deal, and that's soldier's
               honor. You can't fuck them now.

     General Horn looks at Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You can return this gold, be a big
               hero, get another star maybe.

     Everyone stares at General Horn. After a pause, the General
     fires his pistol into the air.

     Iraqi soldiers freeze as they are about to fire on the
     Shiites.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Let's go, Doug.

     Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk 40 yards to the
     frozen Iraqi soldiers and the terrified Shiites.

     Archie, Troy, Doc in handcuffs with MPS, watch.

     Walter and the other U.S. Soldiers watch from afar as
     Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk into the midst of
     Iraqi soldiers.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Who's in charge here?

     An OLDER IRAQI GENERAL steps forward and salutes.

                         GENERAL HORN
               We have to talk about this
               situation.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, U.S. soldiers watch from a distance.

     ARCHIE'S POV FROM AFAR

     General Horn talks to the Iraqi general.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     U.S. Soldiers watch.

     TROY'S POV FROM AFAR

     General Horn and Captain Van Meter walk back toward them.

     It is QUIET. No one says anything.

     Pan across Paco taping.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               In a morbid tableau these men have
               recovered some of the gold bullion
               stolen from Kuwait --

                         CATHY DAITCH
               --in violation of American policy,
               saved over a hundred Shiite
               refugees while recovering stolen
               Kuwaiti gold --

                         GENERAL HORN
               Turn that damn camera off.

     He walks up and forcibly pushes the camera to the ground, Van
     Meter pushes Cathy's camera down.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               That's a 75 thousand dollar
               camera --

                         GENERAL HORN
               What the fuck are they doing here?

                         SARGEANT
               I thought they were authorized --

                         GENERAL HORN
               They are not fucking authorized,
               for Christ's sake --

     MPs take the tapes from the cameras.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Haven't I taken care of you,
               dammit?

     He signals the choppers to start up.

     THE CHOPPER ENGINES SLOWLY WHINE into gear.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               I'm gonna get that tape back.

     General Horn walks over to Troy, Archie, and Doc.

                         GENERAL HORN
               You are under arrest. You are
               going to be court-martialed. And
               you will show us where the bullion
               is right now.

     He walks into a chopper, which is now revving at full speed.

     PAN TO Troy, Archie, Doc turn to the border and watch.
     Walter, the handcuffed Drivers, the MPS and other U.S.
     Soldiers also watch.

     The Shiites are released by the Iraqis. They collect
     themselves and gather in a group. The group walks over the
     border and is received by the relief workers.

     Troy, Archie, Doc watch. A U.S. Soldier WHISTLES through the
     loud choppers.

                         SOLDIER #10
               Yeah.

     Then another Soldier joins in, WHISTLING and CLAPPING.

     Then another soldier, until all twenty U.S.
     Soldiers and MPs present are whistling and cheering Troy,
     Archie, and Doc as they stand there while the choppers throb.

     50 yards away: Imam holds his daughter, on the Iran side,
     about to get into a Red Crescent bus.

     Imam and his daughter wave.

     Archie raises his handcuffed wrists to wave back; Troy and
     Doc follow, raising their cuffed hands to wave.

     Freeze frame.

     year old daughter to him as she holds a new baby and Troy
     uses a respiratory inhaler.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY

     WIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky.

     THE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the
     distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT
     CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING.

     The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders
     APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY
     BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is
     a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby.

     Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER
     stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares
     at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag
     over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy
     turns around, we see his face for the first time.

                         TROY
               Are we shooting people, or what?

                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
               Are we shooting?

                         TROY
               That's what I'm asking you.

                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
               What's the answer?

                         TROY
               I don't know the answer. That's
               what I'm trying to find out.

     PAN TO THREE SOLDIERS 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN --

     SOLDIER #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth.
     TWO OTHER SOLDIERS put out their hands and get pieces of gum.

     PAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands with
     his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into his eye.

                         SOLDIER #3
               It looks like a grain of sand, but
               I don't know how I'm gonna get it
               out--

     CAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               If they surrender, don't shoot, if
               they don't surrender, then shoot.

     PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns
     back to the dune and runs a few yards.

     Stops and stares, raises his rifle.  He aims at the figure on
     the horizon.

     POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

     The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing,
     loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.  Slow motion RIFLE sound.

     Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck
     explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of
     Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up
     to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing.

                         SOLDIER #3 (O.S.)
               That guy just shot a towel head.

                         SOLDIER #4 (O.S.)
               Bullshit.

     YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER

     lies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away. He is
     rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other.
     He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him.

     A WHITE BABY GIRL, covered in blood and placenta, is pulled
     from between the legs of Troy's WIFE, DARLENE. THE NURSE
     holds the SCREAMING BABY aloft, proud and happy.

                         VIG (V.O.)
                      (deep southern accent)

               a rag head, my man.

     EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY (PRESENT)

     The rasping Iraqi dies.

     PAN TO CONRAD VIG, 18 or 20, wiry, intense, deep south,
     wearing Army issue glasses, out of breath.

                         VIG
               Dag.

     Troy turns, upset, murmurs "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys.

                         TROY
               "Gettin' bugged drivin' up and
               down the same old strip, gotta
               find a new place where the kids
               are hip, I get around --"

                         SOLDIER #1
               I didn't think I'd see anyone get
               shot over here.

                         VIG
               It looked like the guy's head blew
               three feet into the air --

     FANTASY SEQUENCE IN SLOW MOTION

     The Iraqi's head pops three feet into the air.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

                         SOLDIER #1
               Bullshit, that's not what happened.

                         VIG
               I said it looked like that
               happened, but then we got here and
               he was still breathing.

                         SOLDIER #2
               Oh, my God, it's just like
               'Predator,' where the guy, the
               black guy --

                         SOLDIER #3
               Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot
               off.

                         VIG
               And when it hits the ground, his
               hand keeps on firing.

     SCENE FROM 'PREDATOR'

     Carl Weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing.

     BACK TO THE SCENE.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Take my picture.

                         VIG

               Twenty dollars, man, what's the
               meaning of life?

                         TROY
               You're lucky you got to see
               anybody shot in this war.

                         VIG
               War's been over five days, Jim,
               ain't gonna be much more of this.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Bobby, take my picture.

     He holds the camera out.

                         SOLDIER #4
               If he shot the guy, it's up to him.

                         SOLDIER #5
               It's not like he shot a fucking
               deer. It's the enemy.

                         VIG
               Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.

     Soldiers get their cash out, Troy takes it.

                         TROY
               Accept no substitute, this is the
               real thing, oh, Jesus [winces] --

                         VIG
               What's wrong?

                         TROY
               I got a really bad headache all of
               a sudden--

     SOLDIER #7 bends next to the corpse and holds his camera out
     at arm's length.

                         VIG
               No free pictures, motherfucker.

     Vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they roll
     down the sand berm.

     "I Just Want to Celebrate" by Rare Earth comes on LOUD.

     Troy walks away holding his temple in pain; SOLDIERS gather
     to stare at the dead Iraqi, getting their cameras out.

     EXT. IRAQI DESERT ROAD - AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN COMBAT GEAR

     dance on a road in the desert. "I Just Want to Celebrate"
     BLARES as the CAMERA DOLLIES THROUGH the soldiers.

     DOLLY INTO TENT TOWN, past bare chested soldiers pumping free
     weights; jogging in formation; sunbathing on big water
     storage mattresses; DOLLY OUT OF THE TENT TOWN, past a
     soldier taking a makeshift foxhole desert bath, past a dead
     Iraqi on the road, a chopper hovering in the distance, to

     DOLLY AROUND the dancing soldiers to see: hundreds of
     stripped Iraqi soldiers lying face down in undershorts.

               There's 700 million in gold out
               there and you're fucking around
               with a watch?

                         HAVICHON
               Bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of
               gold, man.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               One bunker of gold and we retire
               from this horseshit, Hashy--

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Gates.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Just a second. The problem, Hash,
               is how do you find it?

                         HAVICHON
               Like one sowsan bunker out sair --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair,
               Hash, how do you find Saddam's
               bullion?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Could I have some help over here,
               for Chrissakes?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               My goodness, Bill, what seems to
               be the problem?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I'm trying to do a story here and
               the fucking sand is blowing in my
               face --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You want me to stop the sand? I
               can't do anything about that.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               No, you're too busy talking about
               the fucking gold, which by the way
               makes a great story if you'd get
               me a goddamn lead on it --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I think the Saddam story goes more
               for the jugular, journalistically
               speaking, I mean, he's still here
               beating the shit out of his
               country.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Would you just be my guide and not
               my fucking producer? You're my
               guide.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               OK, go do your celebration story,
               Bill.

     SMASH TO: Rowdy soldiers mug for Smithson's camera.

               Give war a chance.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               You've exorcised the ghosts of
               Vietnam with a clear moral
               imperative --

                         SOLDIER #5
               Is that what we did?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Where the hell are you going?

     Archie is walking off with CATHY DAITCH a young reporter.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I'll be right back.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I don't want you helping other
               reporters, goddamn it.

                         SOLDIER #1
               We kicked ass.

                         SOLDIER #6
               We didn't get rid of fucking
               Saddam --

                         SOLDIER #8
               Which totally sucks a big dick.

                         SOLDIER #6
               Those people are getting reemed --

                         SOLDIER #7
               Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Who's getting reemed? The Shiites?

                         SOLDIER #8
               I don't know who they are, man --

                         SOLDIER #6
               We got big firepower but we ain't
               saving them --

                         SOLDIER #5
               Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait.

                         SOLDIER #1
               Weehaaaaaaa.

     Five soldiers chant Lee Greenwood's anthem, "Proud to Be An
     American" into Smithson's camera --

                         SOLDIERS (CHANT)
               'If tomorrow all the things were
               gone that I worked for all my life

     INT. LARGE ARMY TENT - NIGHT

     "Proud To Be An American" BLASTS on as

     Troy, wearing a checked Arab headdress is paraded on
     shoulders. He holds up a Coke can in one hand and a Bud can
     in the other, like torches.

                         TROY
                      (screaming the song)
               And I'm proud I to be an American,
               where at least I know I'm free.
               And I won't forget the men who
               died, who gave that right to me.
               And I'd gladly stand up; next to
               you and defend her still today.
               Cause there ain't no doubt I love
               this land, God bless the U S A --

     Soldiers scream and go nuts.

     Beer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths.

     "I Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man" by Public Enemy blasts.

     WALTER WOGOMAN, 19, quiet, tall, Southern operates two
     parallel boom boxes like a DJ.

     A Soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top of
     another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee. Vig wearing
     a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a
     series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements.

     Soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at Troy. He
     whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes.

     Soldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as the
     music blasts.  Two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols
     at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal.

                         TROY
               Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

     Vig screams into Troy's face at point blank range.

                         VIG
               Rahhhhhhhhh.

                         TROY
               Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Goddamn it, where the fuck did
               this beer come from we gotta take
               more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow.

     EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY

     WIDE SHOT -  HUNDREDS OF IRAQIS walking in the desert, hands
     raised above their heads.

                         TRANSLATOR (MEGAPHONE)
               Hasnala shi aluno quibaan --

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               We will not hurt you. Lay down
               your weapons, get on the ground --

     TWO IRAQIS with bad face wounds get medical help.

     FIVE IRAQIS

     on their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as they disrobe.
     They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as he holds his M-16
     on the begging Iraqis.

                         TROY
               It's cool, no one's gonna hurt
               you --

     Vig whips out his big Thunder 5 pistol and points it in their
     faces.

                         VIG
               Did you rape and torture anybody
               in Kuwait, Abdul?

     The Iraqis wail for mercy. Troy pushes Vig's pistol away.

                         TROY
               You're making them all hysterical.

     Vig points the big pistol at an OLDER IRAQI OFFICER who is
     the only one not taking his clothes off.

                         VIG
               Take your fucking rags off, take
               this off. No comprende English,
               motherfucker?

                         TROY
               What is your fucking problem,
               Conrad?

                         VIG
               I'm trying to git him to obey the
               spirit of things but he won't take
               his rags off.

                         TROY
                      (leans down)
               Sir? We need you to disrobe like
               all the other towel heads, OK?

     The Officer does not move, Troy punches his head once. Vig
     and Walter forcibly pull the Iraqi Officer's pants off. Troy
     takes out a bottle of aspirin, eats two.

                         VIG
               Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy.

     Vig points to the Officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled up
     piece of paper is sticking out --

                         TROY
               There's a document in that guy's
               ass, Conrad.

                         VIG
               That's the freaky thing.

                         WALTER
               Do you think he ate it?

                         TROY
               It wouldn't come out perfect like
               that if he ate it.

     Troy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket.

                         TROY
               Go get it, Private.

                         IRAQI OFFICER
               Hasa man timal!

     The Officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by
     Walter as Vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the rolled up,
     greasy paper from the Officer's ass -- Troy looks disgusted.

                         TROY
               Open it up.

                         VIG
               You only gave me one glove.

                         TROY
               I'm sorry I don't have another,
               but you gotta open it up. That's
               how the chain of command works.

     Vig takes out a U.S. Army pen and uses it to unroll the
     greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand.

     CLOSE UP - THE RUMPLED PAPER

     is a handwritten map, with scant Arabic writing, a few spare
     roads, numbers, and three small boxes.

                         VIG
               What the hell is that?

                         TROY
               Important enough to squeeze your
               cheeks for.

     INT. TELEVISION TRUCK - DAY

     In the half-light of dozens of TV monitors playing Iraqi news
     from around the world, Archie Gates madly humps CATHY DAITCH
     on a lawn chair which is slamming into the monitors.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               You are a trained warrior, trained
               warrior, trained warrior, Jesus
               Christ, Colonel!

     TV monitors crash to the floor as she climaxes. Archie lays
     on the floor catching his breath, stares at a sideways
     monitor of soldiers celebrating; she stands, dresses.

                         CATHY DAITCH
                      (breathless)
               What's Bill got?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Just the celebration story.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               That's it?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's it --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               How about you? Did you find
               anything?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               It could be another bullshit lead
               but I need you to help me find a
               guy who might have something on
               the gold --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Who's the guy?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company
               B--

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Barlow.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               Got a map out of a prisoner's head.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Out of a prisoner's head?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               Or his ear, or his ass, or his
               dick, and they got like a fifty
               page full-color mini atlas of
               Saddam's bunkers --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Out of a guy's dick?

     The door explodes open and two MPs grab Archie, pants around
     his ankles, and drag him from the truck.

     EXT. TELEVISION TRUCK - DAY

     Archie is faced by an OLDER TWO STAR GENERAL (GENERAL PYE),
     a YOUNGER ONE STAR GENERAL (GENERAL HORN).

                         GENERAL PYE
               This is not the way we service the
               media, Major. Stop her --

     WHIP PAN TO Cathy runs away as she dresses, MPs grab her.

                         MP
               You are in violation of code 37D,
               grinding Major Gates.

     They let her go. Soldiers in gas suits laugh.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You guys have no manners
               whatsoever --

     Bill Smithson runs up, agitated.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I told you he was with her --

                         GENERAL PYE
               We're handling this, OK?

     The MP pushes Smithson away.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I wanted help with the gold story,
               and he took off on me--

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's a lot of bullshit.

     Smithson is walked away. Archie pulls his pants up.

                         GENERAL PYE
               I give you a prestige job in the
               media war of the century and the
               guy feels neglected.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I'm helping him plenty with his
               big celebration feature -- Where
               did you get this fucking star?

     Archie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of General
     Horn's collar, with its one star.

                         GENERAL HORN
               They made me a general, pal.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               For what? I don't even know what
               we did over here, but Schwartzkopf
               gets a book deal, you get a star,
               Powell gets to be fucking
               president--

                         GENERAL HORN
               Are you high? This is a huge win
               for us.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Running the press pool's a real
               big win for me.

                         GENERAL PYE
               You want us to kill more Americans
               to occupy Iraq?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I'm just saying it's ironic,
               that's all.

                         GENERAL HORN
               What the fuck is ironic?

               We got the biggest army in the
               world here but Iraq still has the

               that's how the world works I guess.

               Let's see. They had the shit
               bombed out them for two months,
               they're deserting all over the
               place, and they've completely

     Van Meter tries a couple of poses.

               I think I might, Jesus, this feels

     EXT. DESERT - MOVING HUMVEE - MORNING

     Bach's Gloria, from Mass in B Minor plays as

     Pow pow pow, Vig fires his big pistol into the desert.

     Troy throws a painted football into the desert. Doc fires the
     M-16 and blows the ball to pieces.

     Archie drives and moves his hand to the Bach.

     The convertible Humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a
     mounted 60 mm machine gun, a Bart Simpson doll on the grill.

     The Humvee rolls into the vast desert, littered with burned
     out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no people.

     Troy throws another ball, Doc blows it away.

     Doc throws a football from the moving Humvee, Troy fires a

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Shut the fuck up.

     They sit in embarrassed silence; the joyous Bach choir plays.

     EXT. DESERT DAY

     No more music. Troy, Doc, and Vig stand spread apart. They
     wear white anti-gas suits and hold pistols and drink from
     plastic water bottles. A bomb crater is nearby, a wrecked,
     burned truck to the side, a SKINNY COW meanders.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               When we pull up to the bunker, the
               approach is something called
               violence of action, which is
               standard in special operations. It
               means your movement is so fast and
               decisive that the guards are
               frozen and we haven't fired a
               single shot.

     Troy kicks at something in the sand -- and a decayed human
     arm springs out, attached to a body with a half-rotted face.

                         TROY
               Shit.

     They sit in the Humvee and hold their pistols ready.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We'll say the cow is the primary
               guard outside the bunker. We pull
               up fast, and stop short.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               And -- Go.

     The cow stares as the Humvee pulls up to it fast. Troy and
     Doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow --

     The cow steps back, and explodes.

     Troy and Doc stand splattered with cow entrails. The cow's
     head lands with a thud on the hood of the Humvee.

                         ARCHIE GATES

     Archie watches Troy.

               Did you guys see any action at all?

                         VIG

     Archie takes Vig's BIG PISTOL and EMPTIES THE SHELLS and puts
     them into his pocket.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               But other than a wound that
               blinds, paralyzes, or castrates,
               the worst wound I've ever seen is
               something called tension pneumo

               A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill
               you, but makes a little hole in
               the lung, so every time you
               breathe, a little air leaks into
               the chest cavity, which starts to
               fill up like a balloon. And that
               balloon starts to push your organs
               to the side, crushing your lung,
               your liver, your heart. Your own
               breathing kills you, one breath at
               a time -- kinda like a job you
               can't stand or a bad lie you once
               told.

               If you know how to make another
               little hole in the chest to let
               the air out, just like you would
               with an overinflated tire.

     They look at Archie, scared by this.

                         TROY
               Can we play the Beach Boys when we

               Bach.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT

     'I Get Around' by The Beach Boys BLASTS as the Humvee speeds
     along. A big American flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at
     the back of the Hummer.

     The Humvee drives fast into the central square of a small
     village of low, sand-colored stucco buildings and shanties.

     Vig drives as the Humvee speeds around the town square,
     zooming past scared Shiites in black robes, a few skinny
     dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi soldiers.

                         VIG
               Where's the bunker?

                         ARCHIE GATES

     He studies the map and points to a decayed green building.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               There.

     Vig jerks the wheel right.  They drive fast.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No -- there.

     Archie points left. Vig jerks the wheel left, drives straight
     toward a low cement building with two Iraqi soldiers in front.

     Iraqi soldiers look scared as the Humvee drives up, like it's
     going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze.

     Vig stands and speaks into a megaphone.

                         VIG
               We are the Army of the United
               States of America. We are here to
               protect you. Remain calm.

     Troy and Doc leap from the Humvee with pistols drawn and
     their free hands held up in a 'halt' sign. The TWO IRAQI
     GUARDS look stunned as Troy and Doc simply take their machine
     guns and put the Iraqis face down on the ground. Troy and Doc
     pull out plastic twist hand-cuffs, as used in urban riots.

     Archie bounds forward holding up a thick white document.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Orders from President Bush, step
               aside.

     Troy finishes handcuffing one of the Iraqi soldiers, as a
     gaunt mother, with a baby in her arms, opens her blouse,
     revealing her small breasts. Other peasants gather.

                         IRAQI MOTHER
               No milk. Baby milk.

     Troy looks shocked until Archie suddenly pushes him past the
     Iraqi mother and to the door of the bunker, which Doc holds.

     INT. BUNKER - DAY

     Five IRAQI SOLDIERS look disoriented and scared as they hold
     their hands up in the air.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Do not panic.  Step outside --

     Iraqi women and children kiss Vig's feet.

     The five Iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands
     raised, and the starved Shiite civilians spit and throw
     stones at them while 'I Get Around' keeps playing.

     Archie runs down the narrow stairs of the bunker, followed by
     Troy and Doc.

     INT. BASEMENT OF BUNKER - DAY

     Doc lashes an Iraqi's hands behind his back and cuffs him.

     Troy shoots the door lock with his pistol.  Then backs up and
     gives it a running shoulder. The door doesn't budge.

                         TROY
               Shit.

     He holds his shoulder in pain.  Archie kicks the door
     repeatedly.  Troy joins him, it finally flies open.

                         TROY
               Freeze.

     Troy is embraced by an Iraqi soldier, about 25.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               I am love United States of
               Freedom. I am hate Saddam.

     Troy tries some karate moves, jerking his elbows to dislodge
     the Iraqi from the bear hug --

                         TROY
               Ya -- ya -- ha --

     Doc points his pistol in the Iraqi's face.

                         DOC
               Let him go.

     The Iraqi throws his hands in the air.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               No problem, my friend.

     Archie goes to a series of WOODEN CRATES the size of file
     cabinets, where Doc helps Archie take off his back pack.
     Archie pulls out a bolt cutter and a pneumatic saw, both
     attached to a small air tank - and opens the crate, which is
     filled with hundreds of Kuwaiti passports.

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               You look for the chemical weapon?

                         TROY
               No. We look for the gold.

     They use the power tools to open the second crate -- also
     filled with hundreds of passports.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Where's the gold?

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
               They move the gold.

     Archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the Iraqi,
     who says nothing.

                         DOC
               Kill him.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Not yet.

                         TROY
               Kill him now.

     They point their guns. It's a show. Archie holds the map.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Where?

                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
                      (points to map)
               This bunker. I'll take you.

     EXT. BUNKER - DAY

     FOUR NEW IRAQI SOLDIERS, armed with rifles, run from the far
     side of the square and start shooting.

     30 rock-throwing Shiite scatter at the gunfire. TWO MEN fall
     to the ground as they are shot.

                         CHILD
               Ma-Maa.

     Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone
     as he points his big unloaded pistol. The soldiers point
     their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of
     them look to the side and shout.

                         ARMED IRAQI SOLDIER
               Ganan azwar!

     PAN TO a shiny METAL TANKER TRUCK three hundred yards out,
     bearing down fast on the village square.

     The soldiers open fire on the truck.

     INT - THE CAB OF THE TANKER TRUCK

     The Shiite riding shotgun fires back, as the windshield
     shatters on the truck. The driver is dead. The other Shiite
     grabs the wheel.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     Archie bursts out the front door, followed by Troy and Doc.
     They freeze as --

     The tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet away.

     An Iraqi soldier fires a grenade-launcher off his shoulder
     which explodes the container on the back of the truck --

     Milk explodes everywhere, gushing around the wheels of the
     Humvee and the feet of Archie and the others.

     Shiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush
     out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk. Other Shiites
     crowd the Humvee and climb in.

     Iraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck.
     Troy and Doc point their guns in the crowd.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Move. Out of the way.

     Archie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee.

                         SHIITE WOMAN
               Hos-pital.

     She holds a SHIRTLESS BOY of 7 with a bandage around his
     entire chest. Doc pushes her off the Humvee.

                         SHIITE MAN
               America help.

     He grabs Archie. Troy shoves the man off the vehicle. Vig
     starts the engine.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Give them MRE's.

     Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army
     Meal Rations to the crowd -- Vig leans on the horn.

     The friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it
     starts to pull away. Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out,
     and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites.

     Archie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away.

     EXT. DESERT MARSH - DAY

     Raging oil fires, 50 feet high -- billowing black smoke.
     Walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke. Paco the
     Cameraman sits on back. Bill Smithson sits in the sidecar.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               This is boring, I already did this
               damn story, goddamn it, where the
               hell is the gold?

                         WALTER
               How about rare pelican migration
               out by the marshes?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               What?

                         WALTER
               These brave pelicans are migrating
               in spite of massive pollution --

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Fuck that. Stop the bike.

     Walter keeps driving.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Doc gets out of the stopped Humvee, shaken, and walks around.

                         DOC
               I'm all right, I'm cool.

     He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.
     Archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What is the art of war, because it
               is not for killing people, it's a
               stratagem to give life to many by
               killing the evil perpetrated by a
               few -- I am burning up in this
               goddamn suit --

     He angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat-drenched
     green T-shirt underneath.  Troy and Vig guzzle water.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Discriminating use of violence as
               a last resort, and even then,
               carefully, surgically, that's what
               I learned, that's what I'm good
               at. But now they underestimate all
               this, bomb the same towns for six
               weeks  and still leave the scumbag
               dictator to starve and butcher his
               own people.

     The others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits.

                         TROY
                      (agitated)
               I don't even know what happened
               back there. Civilians were
               spitting on their own soldiers;
               the soldiers were shooting the
               civilians and ignoring us --

                         DOC
               They already surrendered to us.
               Now they're after Shiites.

                         VIG
               What exactly is a Shiite?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They make up the ethnic majority
               but they don't have any power.
               When Bush pulled us out, he told
               them to start a civil war to bring
               Saddam down, and now they're
               getting wasted.

                         VIG
                      (totally puzzled)
               The civil war? How could it be the
               civil war?

     FANTASY - STOCK FOOTAGE: UNION SOLDIERS FIGHT DIXIE REBELS

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     Vig looks puzzled.

                         TROY
               It's a war inside the same
               country, Conrad. That's a civil
               war.

     Archie chucks each of them MARINE UNIFORMS without name tags
     which everyone puts on, except Troy.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Put these on, we are now U.S.
               Marines.

                         TROY
               I can't do this, OK? Because I've
               got a family and if I shit in a
               bag the rest of my life cuz I got
               shot after the war's already over
               that would be pretty fucking
               stupid, wouldn't it?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What is the most important thing
               in life?

                         TROY
               What the fuck are you talking
               about?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What is it?

                         TROY
               Did you hear anything I said.

                         VIG
               Respect is the most important.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Too dependent on other people.

                         DOC
               Money.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Comes and goes, man.

                         TROY
               What is this bullshit?

                         DOC
               What's the most important thing?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Necessity. That's what dictates
               what will happen at any given time
               in life. Necessity says we don't
               spend American lives taking out
               Saddam,  which leaves Saddam the
               necessity of taking out the
               Shiites so he can stay in power,
               which leaves us to take the gold.

                         TROY
               We could've been shot.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Did you notice they didn't touch
               us?  We decimated their entire
               country. They're scared shitless
               of us. [looks at his watch]
               There's time to try another
               bunker. I say we go.

                         DOC
               Let's do it.

                         VIG
               Rock and roll.

                         TROY
               OK. And I'll be wearing
               fashionable kevlar. As a necessity.

     He pulls a vest out of the Humvee.

     EXT. MARSH

     The motorcycle is stopped by the marsh. Siberian pelicans fly
     all around. Many lie dead on the ground.  Bill Smithson paces
     with a cell phone.

                         BILL SMITHSON
                      (on cell phone)
               I'm at some goddamn marsh, all
               we've seen are Russian cranes.

                         WALTER
               Pelicans.

                         BILL SMITHSON
                      (on the cell phone)
               I think the Saddam story goes more
               for the jugular, journalistically
               speaking, Al. Let's grow some
               balls and do the Shiite uprising,
               for Christ's sake.

     Bill Smithson closes the cell phone.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               We're going north to do the
               Shiites.

                         WALTER
               I thought the gold was the hot
               spot.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Karbala's the new hotspot, and
               I'm driving.

                         WALTER
               Military regulations, you cannot
               drive.

     Smithson mounts the bike. The cameraman sits on back. Walter
     points his pistol at Smithson.

                         WALTER
               Get off the vehicle, sir.

     Smithson starts the bike.

                         WALTER
               Don't make me shoot you, sir.

     The bike pulls out, leaving him behind. He runs after the
     bike and jumps into the side car.

     EXT. COMPANY B CAMP - DAY

     Captain Van Meter strolls, handling an M-16.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               The M-16 is the basic weapon of
               the infantry. During Vietnam, it
               was fully automatic.

                         GENERAL HORN (O.S.)
               Doug?

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Yes, General.

                         GENERAL HORN
               What the fuck are you doing?

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Well, I'm giving an interview to
               CBS.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Do you have authorization?

     Van Meter pulls out a folded paper and gives it to the
     general, who looks at it.

                         GENERAL HORN
               No.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               No?

                         GENERAL HORN
               Who gave you this?

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Major Gates.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Archie Gates gave you this? Jesus
               Christ, Doug, come with me.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               I don't get to do the interview?

                         GENERAL HORN
               No, you don't get to do the
               interview.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Faster.

     Bach's 'Gloria' plays loud as Vig drives and Archie stares
     straight ahead as the Humvee picks up speed.

     EXT. ANOTHER VILLAGE OUTSIDE KARBALA - DAY

     The Hummer zips into a bigger village piazza with an old
     fortress at one end, and races straight to the entrance to an
     underground bunker in the middle of the piazza.

                         ARCHIE GATES
                      (into the megaphone)
               United States Marine Corps. Put
               your weapons down.

     Troy and Doc leap out, hold pistols out at arm's length as
     they accost TWO IRAQI SOLDIERS pointing rifles at them.

                         TROY
               Drop your weapon.

                         DOC
               Put it down.

     Troy and Doc shove the two Iraqis face down in the dirt and
     cuff their hands behind their backs.

                         VIG
               Don't make me smoke your ass,
               Abdul.

     INT. SECOND IRAQI BUNKER - DAY

     Archie runs down a narrow cement corridor, pistol held at
     arm's length, white document in the other hand; followed by
     Troy and Doc, pistols drawn.

     An IRAQI SOLDIER steps into the corridor at the far end, sees
     Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back. Archie and
     Troy run right past the scared Iraqi. Doc comes third,
     slamming the Iraqi face down and cuffing him.

     Archie kicks a door open and goes in, followed by Troy.

     INT. INNER ROOM, SECOND IRAQI BUNKER - DAY

     Archie and Troy burst in, pointing their guns aggressively.

                         TROY
               Freeze.

     A large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new
     appliances: blenders, cuisinarts, CD players, small TVs. A
     huge portrait of Saddam Hussein covers one wall.

     A television plays a rerun of 'Happy Days' in Arabic.

     Another TV: CNN's first reports of the Rodney King beating.

     An IRAQI CAPTAIN sits in a chair in front of the TVs.

     TWO IRAQIS sit loading rifles. Two others sit at a radio.

     They all jump to their feet when Archie bursts in, except for
     the officer watching 'Happy Days' and CNN..

                         ARCHIE GATES
               By order of the cease-fire signed
               in Safwan, March 3, the United
               States Marines hereby confiscate
               all material stolen by Iraq from
               the Emirate of Kuwait --

     One of the rifle-loading Iraqis tries to run. Troy heads him
     off with his pistol --

     WHIP PAN TO Doc, who turns the shortwave radio off, pushes
     the TWO IRAQIS to the ground. One goes peacefully, the other
     resists; Doc smacks him in the side of the head with his
     pistol, which fires accidentally. Everyone grabs their heads
     and ducks -- except Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Never hit anyone with your pistol,
               Doc.

                         DOC
               Sorry about that.

     Archie is offered a cuisinart by the Iraqi Captain.

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               For wife.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I've been divorced three times.

     Troy has one rifle Iraqi on the ground, but the second is on
     his knees, putting a CD into a mini-stereo.

                         RIFLE IRAQI #2
               Newest and best.

                         TROY
               No, newest and best has better
               noise reduction.

     The Iraqi looks puzzled.

                         TROY
               Less distortion. Get down on the
               floor, OK?

     He pushes the man face down, cuffs his hands. Olivia Newton-
     John's "I Wanna Get Physical" PLAYS.

                         TROY
               This is bad music, understand?
               It's bad for you.

                         DOC (O.S.)
               Hey --

     WHIP PAN TO the resistant Iraqi struggles to break away and
     Doc punches him in the head twice, the Iraqi starts crying.

                         ARCHIE GATES
                      (to Iraqi Captain)
               Where's the gold, Captain? Tell us
               so we don't have to kill you.

                         TROY
               There's another room over here.

     PAN TO Troy pointing to a narrow door in a corner of the
     room. Archie kicks it open.

     INT. INNER ROOM - DAY

     A bound, naked SHIITE MAN IN GLASSES, clean shaven, sits on
     the floor in a five foot square shallow metal box, four
     inches deep, filled with water. There is an electric cable
     going into the water. The naked Shiite in glasses shakes.

     Troy watches Archie walk over and yank the cable out.

                         IRAQI SARGEANT
               I am just do my job, buddy.

     Archie pauses, then gives the Sargeant a backhand that sends
     him flying to the corner. Archie steps on the man's wrist,
     takes the pistol out of his hand. Troy watches.

     Archie turns and sees TEN SHIITES across the room: 3 MEN, 3
     WOMEN, 4 CHILDREN. The men and women are bound and GAGGED.

     Archie steps toward the Shiites, but the INTERROGATOR, 35,
     also a captain, steps in his way.

                         INTERROGATOR
               These Shiite. Iraq problem. United
               States is out now.

     Archie stares at the INTERROGATOR with contempt.

                         INTERROGATOR
               We take them outside, so it don't
               bother you, OK, sir? Kata fanam.

     The disarmed Iraqi Sargeant NODS and opens a small rear door
     and pushes the Shiites out. Archie walks back to the main
     room and points his pistol in the Captain's face.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Take us to the basement.

     EXT. FRONT OF BUNKER TWO - DAY

     Vig keeps the TWO CUFFED IRAQI GUARDS on the ground at gun
     point as 15 SHIITES with crude clubs and sling shots encircle.

     One of the Shiites shoots a rock from the slingshot and nails
     a handcuffed Iraqi in the back of the head.

                         VIG
               Don't start this shit again.

     The Shiites back away as Vig motions with his big pistol.

                         VIG
               I know ya'll Shiite gettin' yer
               asses whipped --  Hey, what the
               hell is going on here?

     PAN TO the ten Shiites, and the naked Man with Glasses, who
     is getting dressed, exiting the side of the bunker, ushered
     by the unarmed Iraqi Sargeant.

                         VIG
               Git on the fucking ground, Arab.

                         IRAQI SARGEANT
               Prisoner stay. Gabar matan.

                         VIG
               What the fuck are you talking
               about?

     Suddenly a SHIITE WOMAN runs up to the tortured Shiite Man
     with Glasses and embraces him, sobbing. A LITTLE GIRL with
     dirty casts on both broken arms runs up and hugs his legs.

     The bound Shiite prisoners start to walk away from the
     bunker, and the unarmed Sargeant has a fit.

                         IRAQI SARGEANT
               Kinam vanir! Vanir!

     He chases the prisoners, pushes them back. The free Shiites
     shoot rocks and club him.

                         VIG
               Goddamn it everybody calm down.

     INT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     Archie runs down several narrow sets of cement stairs,
     followed by the Interrogator, the other Iraqi Captain, Troy,
     and Doc. (SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH)

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               It's my ass, donkey dick, Saddam
               will shoot me dead.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Saddam worries more about the
               Shiite than the gold.

     EXT. BUNKER - DAY

     The Shiite crowd curses and spits on the Iraqi soldiers. The
     Sargeant is beaten.

     Suddenly an Iraqi armored truck with a mounted machine gun
     races up and SEVEN IRAQI SOLDIERS pour out swinging clubs,
     followed by an IRAQI MAJOR, about 45. The Iraqi soldiers
     savagely beat the Shiites.

     Vig looks horrified as he watches.

     TWO SOLDIERS grab the Woman from the Man With Glasses, and
     drag her into a circle with three other soldiers; the ten
     year-old girl with dirty casts on both arms, screams and
     punches at them.

     The Man With Glasses is held down at knife point.

                         VIG
                      (into the megaphone)
               This is the United States Military.

     The Iraqi Major glances over at Vig, but the soldiers do not
     stop brutalizing the Shiites -- they round up eight more
     Shiites and make them lay face down.

     INT. BASEMENT

     Troy and Doc disarm TWO GUARDS outside a door in the basement.

     Archie goes through the door, followed by the Iraqi
     Interrogator and Captain.

     INT. ROOM OF BUNKER 2 - DAY

     Bright white cement, many overhead lights and a high ceiling.
     empty but for 15 brand new, jumbo-sized Louis Vuitton
     suitcases standing neatly in a row in the center of the room.

     Archie stands looking at the suitcases with Troy and Doc.

     Several of the big Vuitton suitcases are laid on their sides
     by Archie, Troy and Doc.

     The Iraqi Captain paces frantically punching and kicking the
     walls and talking (SUBTITLED in ENGLISH).

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               It's Saddam's gold.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Shut up, he signed the treaty.

     The suitcases are quickly unzipped. One suitcase is full of
     gleaming antique silverware. One suitcase is full of jewelry.

     Archie opens one full of hundreds of gold Cartier watches.

     Troy and Doc slip a handful of jewelry into their pockets.

     The Iraqi Captain goes nuts, throwing himself on Doc's back,
     choking Doc, who flails about. Troy punches the Iraqi in the
     head and rips him off Doc.

     Archie puts his pistol in the man's face.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Listen to me: we leave you alone
               to kill your Shiites, but
               everything you took from Kuwait,
               that belongs to us now, understand?

     He turns to Doc.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Put it back.

                         DOC
               Why?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Stick to the plan. The plan is for
               gold.

     Doc and Troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of jewelry.

     Archie opens another Vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside -
     it's full of Kuwaiti passports.

     When Doc opens the next suitcase, he freezes. Archie looks
     over and freezes. Troy closes cuffs behind the Captain's back
     and looks over his shoulder -- wide-eyed.

     The very large Vuitton suitcase is filled with five-kilo
     bricks of gold. They all stare. Troy picks one up.

                         TROY
               Is this five kilos?

     Archie holds another brick.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Yeah, that's five kilos.

                         TROY
               Five, six, seven, eight, there's
               sixty bricks in this suitcase.

                         DOC
               Times 50K each --

                         TROY
               Three million dollars.

     Archie opens another large Vuitton suitcase, and it is also
     filled with sixty bars. Troy opens another suitcase, there's
     another sixty bars. Doc opens another, another sixty bars.
     They frantically check all of the suitcases. The handcuffed
     Captain is crying.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each.
               That's thirty million dollars.

     Archie, Doc and Troy look at each other in shock.

     With effort, Doc and Troy help Archie pick up the heavy,
     jumbo-sized suitcase sideways, like a table top.

                         TROY
               I'm gonna get a fleet of Lexus
               convertibles in different colors.

                         DOC
               I told you Lexus doesn't make a
               convertible.

                         TROY
               I'll bet you a Lexus they do.

                         DOC
               OK, you're on for a Lexus, but it
               won't be a convertible.

     Suddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to the
     floor; one lands on Troy's foot. He jumps in pain.

                         TROY
               Shit.

     Archie, Troy, and Doc hoist another suitcase sideways and the
     bricks rip through and fall to the floor --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They didn't get it here in these
               bags.

               Tensilary strength, it's what the
               suitcase can hold.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You got any more luggage here?

     The Interrogator looks at him.

     INT. BUNKER BASEMENT - LATER

     120 small, round, Vuitton overnight bags, laid out and
     opened, cover the entire floor of the basement.

     Troy and Doc finish putting 5 bars in each bag. Archie paces,
     sweating, speedy like he's on cocaine.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It's crazy to take it all, we're
               not prepared for it. It's crazy
               not to take it all, how can we
               leave it?

     Troy and Doc look nervous.

                         TROY
               What's the shipping plan?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I told you that's handled.

                         TROY
               How is it handled? You have to
               tell us now.

                         TROY
               Conrad, we need a trailer --

     The Iraqi Major stares coldly at Troy. Troy stares at the two

     They hurry past the huge poster of Saddam, the TVs playing
     'Happy Days' and Rodney King, the many shelves of stereos,
     etc., and past the soldiers lying face down, handcuffed.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     Archie, Doc, and the Interrogator charge out of the bunker
     with Vuitton luggage and put it onto the ox cart Troy has
     rigged. Archie and Doc stop and stare in shock --
     Soldiers 6 & 7 drag and beat Shiites; 5 wounded men and women
     lie on the ground bleeding. A cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with
     a bleeding head. Five soldiers continue to encircle someone
     (the Shiite woman). The Man In Glasses and the Little Girl
     PRAY in ARABIC as they bow on the ground.

     Troy and Vig stare back at Archie, looking tense.

     The Iraqi Major greets the Interrogator warmly and they
     embrace. Then the Major salutes Archie.

                         IRAQI MAJOR

               These man help you.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You go away fast from this
               bullshit.

     Archie looks at one soldier's hands.

     CLOSE UP: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists.

     PAN UP TO THE FACES of the Iraqi soldiers.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Let's load up and get out of here.

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Iraqi Soldiers 6 & 7 carry suitcases up the narrow stairs.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     Luggage is loaded into the Humvee and the cart while Troy
     directs Iraqis 6 & 7; Doc and Vig help.

                         TROY
               Lay that one flat; OK, sideways --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               This isn't gonna work.

                         TROY
               Sure it is --

     The cart collapses from the weight into a pile of broken wood.

     The Vuitton bags roll onto the debris-cluttered ground, one
     goes through a pool of blood. Doc picks the case up.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               You need a truck.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We'll rig two carts.

                         TROY
               Let's take the truck.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're not taking their truck.

                         TROY
               Why not?

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               We cooperate with peace accord.
               Please take truck.

                         TROY
               Let's take the truck.

     Archie looks vaguely disgusted.

     Troy backs the truck up.

     Vuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck,
     which is completely full.

     Archie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee. Vig sits next to
     him. Archie starts the engine. Iraqi 6 taps on the door of
     the Humvee by way of saying goodbye. Archie nods.

     The Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Nazaran yafit haisul.

     Archie watches as Iraqis 6 & 7 walk directly to the circle of
     soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been
     raped. They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in
     an open area and shoot her dead.

     Troy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away. Doc stares.

     Archie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there
     for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman.

     The Girl in arm casts screams. She is grabbed by the hair and
     pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses
     punches him and takes the girl. The soldier chases them with
     a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.

     Archie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks
     slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               This has to stop.

     The Iraqis look at him. The soldier with the knife continues
     to slash the Man In Glasses.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You get your ass kick in a war, it
               feel good to be strong again.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What did you say?

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               You go now, please.

     He salutes Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I don't think so. I'm sure you
               know about the Geneva Convention,
               right?

                         INTERROGATOR
               Geneva convention? You bomb my
               house, man.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               That Shiite man is leader of
               uprising. He kill my man.

                         TROY
               Archie, let's stick to the plan,
               sir. The plan is for gold, right?

                         DOC
               We can help them first, then be on
               our way.

                         TROY
               No, we can't. It's not what we're
               here for.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               How much?

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               What?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               How much gold do you want to let
               these people come with us?

     The Iraqi Major smiles. The Interrogator laughs.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Cannot do.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What do you mean, cannot do? I'm
               offering you a lot of money.

     The Iraqi Major continues smiling.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Cannot let Shiite go --

                         INTERROGATOR
               Saddam kill us.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
               Saddam kill to me if we let them
               go, OK? Now you go.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cover me.

                         TROY
               Jesus Christ, we can't save
               everybody.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Are you listening? I said cover me.

     Troy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the
     truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee, and they nervously point
     their pistols. Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come
     forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also
     come forward. To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near
     Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight
     prone Shiite prisoners laying face down.

     Vig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and
     mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is
               that clear?

                         VIG
               Yes, sir.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Because we know what bullets do to
               vital organs, don't we?

                         VIG
               Make infected pockets filled with
               bile, sir.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's right, that's what they do.

     Troy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward
     the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl.

     Archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling
     the blade away from the man's body. He holds the soldier's
     wrist up. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free
     hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting
     the Iraqi into a choke hold. The soldier drops the knife in
     the dirt.

     The bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground,
     clutching the Little Girl in arm casts.

     Troy, Doc, Vig point their guns. The Iraqi Major is pissed.

     Archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face
     down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. Archie
     helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl,
     and walks them over to the Humvee.

     Two Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick
     them back down.

                         IRAQI MAJOR
                      (pissed)
               U.S.A. is out of Shiite war.

     The Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to
     the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No shooting.

     Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi
     soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.

     CUT BACK TO the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his
     machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee.

     Archie winces, but doesn't let go. The Major does it again,
     smashing Archie's hand. Archie winces, doesn't let go. The
     Major tries to jerk the barrel up, but Archie pushes it down,
     and it fires by accident, into the Major's leg. The Major
     howls with pain. Blood dribbles out the bottom of his pants
     leg like piss.

     Troy covers Iraqi 6 with his rifle.

                         TROY
               What's happening?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Accident. Stay cool.

     Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun from one Iraqi
     in the rear to another, but doesn't shoot. Iraqi soldiers
     point their rifles at the Americans.

     ANGLE ON TROY

                         TROY
               No.

     WHIP PAN TO Iraqi 6 jerks his rifle toward Archie and fires.

     The sound cuts out.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: WHIP PAN from Iraqi rifle to Archie.

     The only SOUND is the BULLET PIERCING THE FLESH of Archie's
     lower left arm and tearing his muscle as it passes through.
     Archie grimaces violently in pain.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Troy fires his pistol. NO SOUND except
     for the SLOW MOTION SOUND of the BULLET EXPLODING.

     SLOW MOTION: The bullet tears through Iraqi 6's chest.

     THE ONLY SOUND is the IRAQI'S HEARTBEAT, the bullet tearing
     flesh and crushing bone, and the heartbeat stopping with a
     VIOLENT SPLASH. Iraqi 6 falls to the ground with only a dull
     thud and the slow clank of his gear.

     REGULAR SPEED: Vig swings the mounted machine gun from one
     Iraqi to another, but still doesn't shoot. He looks terrified
     as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.

     Iraqi 7 FIRES twice.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: a bullet tears into Troy's chest with
     a DULL SNAP. He winces in pain.

     PAN TO the windshield of the Humvee shatters behind Doc; he
     turns and fires his pistol.

     PAN TO -- slightly slow motion: NO SOUND EXCEPT THE BULLET
     TEARING INTO IRAQI 7'S KNEE, smashing through bone. He falls
     to the ground clutching his leg.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Vig swings the mounted machine gun and
     FIRES. NO SOUND BUT THE SLOW CRACKS OF THE RED TRACER BULLETS
     EXPLODING from the gun.

     SLOW MOTION: tracer bullets slice across the face of Iraqi 5
     and Iraqi 2 in the rear, NO SOUND BUT THE BULLETS BREAKING
     THROUGH BONE AND FLESH.

     SLOW MOTION: Archie jams his pistol under the Major's chin
     and FIRES -- the ONLY SOUND IS THE. SLOW EXPLOSION OF THE GUN,
     and the slow tearing of tissue, ending with a sharp SNAP as
     the tissue, bone, and the bullet CRACK out the top of the
     Iraqi Major's head.

     HIGH ANGLE LOOKING DOWN -- replay of entire shoot out at
     REGULAR SPEED. Ending on the wide-eyed Little Girl with her
     hand in her mouth, staring.

     ANOTHER ANGLE -- replay of entire shoot out at REGULAR SPEED.
     Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.

     The dead Iraqi Major lies face down in sand with eyes open;
     the Interrogator holds his hand and WEEPS.

     Archie's lightly blood-flecked face stares down at the dead
     Major, clouds pass overhead.

     Dead Iraqi 6 lies with legs twisted under his body.

     A rivulet of blood trickles through the sand. A spider runs
     across it and gets stuck.

     LOW ANGLE up at Doc, stone still, staring straight ahead as
     clouds pass slowly above him in the sky.

     Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun back and forth.

     Troy, drenched in sweat, looks pained as he unbuttons his
     shirt: there's a gunshot in his kevlar vest. The slug drops
     out of the dent, into his hand -- he exhales.

     Iraqis 2, 3, 4, and the Sargeant, throw their hands up in
     surrender and drop their weapons.  Big Iraqi 2 walks toward
     the Humvee in surrender, and bows down.

     Archie points.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cover these three.

     Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining
     Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Doc.

     Doc follows Archie over to the three Iraqi soldiers.

                         DOC
               Down.

     The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.

                         IRAQI SOLDIER
               Kazal stan hamir in fatar.

     Doc takes the Iraqi soldiers' guns and pushes them down.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Put the Shiites in the Humvee.

                         TROY
               There's no room.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Make room.

                         TROY
               What the fuck happened to
               necessity?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It just changed.

                         TROY
               Not for me.

     Shiites and Iraqi soldiers watch the debate nervously.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Obey the fucking order, Barlow.

                         TROY
               This is fucked up.

     Doc points to the Shiites.

                         DOC
               What if that was you?

     Troy displays the gunshot in the Kevlar.

                         TROY
               What if this was you not wearing
               Kevlar?

     Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK. They turn.

     A tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street,
     followed by a truck with a rocket launcher.

                         TROY
               Great, a fucking tank. That should
               send us on our way.

                         VIG
               Grenade launcher, sir.

     Vig struggles to lift the grenade launcher.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No. Let's get out of here.

                         TROY
               It's about fucking time.

     Troy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine.
     Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig.

     PAN TO the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the
     Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee. Doc jumps in.

     The tank approaches. The Humvee pulls away. The tank rolls in
     from the side, but the tank turret WHINES and CLICKS, stuck
     in place. An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank.

                         TANK IRAQI
               Hazal mafan.

     He gestures to the whining, stuck, turret. Another Iraqi
     tries pushing the turret. The truck with the small rocket
     launcher pulls up.

     INT./EXT. HUMVEE

     as it bounces along fast. Archie is in pain while Doc pours
     disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left
     arm, and wraps it. Vig looks terrified as he drives.

     INT. TRUCK

     Troy, driving alone, speeds the truck as fast as it will go,
     bouncing along the road.

                         TROY
               We were home free, you stupid son
               of a bitch.

     WIDE AERIAL SHOT

     the truck is 60 yards behind the Humvee

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               What's the tank doing?

     POV

     through Doc's jiggling binoculars of the tank turning.

                         DOC (O.S.)
               Lining us up --

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     Vig pushes the Humvee's accelerator to the floor.
         
     The Shiite Man In Glasses and his Little Girl cling to the
     Humvee as they sit on top of the Vuitton hat cases with eight
     other Shiites, including TWO FIVE YEAR OLDS, A BOY AND GIRL.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     Two Iraqi soldiers take a THIN ROCKET, four feet long, and
     load a clear plastic canister of brown fluid into it. A
     GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, a soldier is hit in the arm.

     WHIP PAN TO a Shiite boy with an old rifle in the third floor
     window of a small stone building. Iraqis shout and point at
     the sniper. The tank turns to the building.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     The Humvee drives fast over the bumpy two-lane road.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     The tank fires a round at the building which COLLAPSES.

     INT. SHIITE BUILDING - DAY

     A SHIITE MOTHER, FATHER, AND TWO CHILDREN pray at a crude
     table when the ceiling collapses.

     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

     The Iraqi soldiers fire the rocket launcher.

                         DOC (O.S.)
               Incoming.

     EXT. DESERT -  DAY

     Vig turns the speeding Humvee off the road. Archie jerks the
     wheel back.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Stay on the road.

                         VIG
               I don't wanna get hit.

     SLOW MOTION: Doc looks straight up with the binoculars.

     SLOW MOTION: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke
     across the sky.

     REAR OF HUMVEE, SLOW MOTION: half the Shiites hunch down,
     bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their
     necks, looking straight up into the sky. They cower when
     there is an EXPLOSION above.

     PAN UP TO - REGULAR SPEED: the ROCKET EXPLODES in the sky a
     hundred yards above the Humvee -- INTO A BROWN CLOUD.

                         DOC
               Gas.

     Troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up
     at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast.

     Archie and Doc grapple to put on their gas masks. Vig reaches
     around behind him for his mask as he drives.

                         VIG
               Where's my mask?

     He accidentally veers off the road into the open desert.

     ZOOM IN TO a field of mines sitting right on top of the sand,
     20 yards ahead. [Iraqi mines were often placed this way]

     ZOOM IN ON Archie's alarmed face

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Mine.

     Archie dives from the Humvee followed by Vig, Doc, the Man In
     Glasses holding the Little Girl, the other Shiites, including
     the Two Five Year Olds. The Hummer drives ten yards, hits the
     first mine with an explosion and flies into the air --

     INT. TRUCK DRIVEN BY TROY

     Flying debris smashes the windshield. Troy instinctively
     jerks the wheel and the truck flips onto its side and slides
     across the sand.

     EXT. MINEFIELD

     The airborne Humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is
     blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces.

     Troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a
     halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked Humvee.

     SILENCE. A wheel on the wrecked Humvee spin in the air,
     squeaking.

     Louis Vuitton suitcases are scattered all over. One has
     opened and the gold bars are spilled around.

     Shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some
     limping. They cover their faces with their clothes as the
     dense brown fog descends around them.

     Vig's right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess -- he
     gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down.

     Archie puts his gas mask on the Little Girl with arm casts.
     Doc takes his mask off when he sees what Archie has done and
     gives it to the Shiite Man in Glasses.

     Doc picks up Vig's glasses and hands them to Vig, who stands,
     blinking his one good eye, while blood streams down his face.

                         DOC
               Cover your face, Conrad. Cover
               your mouth, man.

     Vig is in shock. Doc lifts Vig's bloody hand to Vig's mouth.
     Unseen in the fog, Troy climbs out of the overturned truck.

     He picks up two Vuitton hat cases, looks up, sees the TWO
     LITTLE CHILDREN from the Humvee, running across a mine field
     SCREAMING.

                         TROY
               Hey. Stop.

     Troy stands watching as the children run farther away, crying.

                         TROY
               Goddamn it.

     He runs, hard, after the children, who are now 70 yards away,
     the Vuitton hat cases banging against his legs.

     Doc pulls a syringe from a sterile packet, is about to stick
     it into his leg when Archie grabs his hand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Don't do it, this isn't sarin.
               We'd be dead by now.

                         DOC
               Is it mustard?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It's C.S.

                         DOC
               What's that?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Tear gas times ten, but it's not
               lethal. Where's Barlow?

                         DOC
               I don't know.

     EXT. DESERT - MINEFIELD

     Troy chases the children through the brown fog, he drops one
     of the suitcases, catches up to the Girl and scoops her up in
     his left arm and covers her face with her coat.

     TROY'S POV

     as he runs between land mines after the Boy, who is way ahead.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     Troy drops the other Vuitton bag, catches the Boy and has
     both children under his arms like footballs -- when suddenly
     Troy is grabbed from behind with a cord around his neck -- he
     lands on his back with the two children in his arms.

     TROY'S POV LOOKING UP

     the Iraqi Interrogator, wearing a gas mask, kicks Troy in the
     head. The screaming Children are torn from Troy's arms by
     Iraqi soldiers. Troy reaches for his pistol and it is ripped
     from his hand as he is dragged to an Iraqi jeep.

     EXT. DESERT - NEAR ARCHIE AND DOC

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Does anybody see Barlow?

     Archie and Doc circle through the thick haze carrying a
     Vuitton hat case and cover their mouths and noses.

                         DOC
               I can't even see the truck.

     About five Shiites wander around, confused.

                         VIG
               Look out.

     Archie spins around, drops the bag and points his pistol.

     TWO BLACK ROBED FIGURES pick up Vuitton hat cases.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Don't move.

     A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared
     Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.

     More black cloaked figures appear. There are THIRTY IN ALL.

     Archie, Doc, and Vig look disoriented, point their pistols
     around as black robes appear and lead the Shiites away.

                         VIG
               What's going on?

     The robes lead the Shiites to a 4 FOOT HIGH TUNNEL ENTRANCE
     in a mound of desert earth and disappear into it.

     Vig stands and rubs his one good eye. Doc grabs Vig by the
     arm and pulls him back toward the tunnel.

                         DOC
               Get in the tunnel.

     Vig jerks his arm away.

                         VIG
               Troy.

     Doc grabs Vig.

                         DOC
               You're gonna die.

     Vig punches Doc in the side of the head. Doc punches Vig in
     the stomach. They fall to the ground, fighting.

     Archie searches for Troy in the brown haze.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Barlow.

     Two black-robed figures pull Vig off Doc and drag him to the
     tunnel. Another robed figure pulls Doc to the tunnel.

     Archie walks, looks for Troy, chokes, vomits into the sand.
     A black robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back
     to the tunnel, where they disappear inside.

     INT. TUNNEL - DAY

     Chaos. People choking and vomiting. GAS LANTERNS SWING. The
     tunnel is 6 feet tall. Buckets are passed, filled with oiled
     rags that people use to wipe their faces. Archie takes a
     dripping rag and wipes his eyes, nose, mouth.

                         VIG
               We have to go back. We can't leave
               him there.

     Vig's mutilated right eye is bleeding.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We have to wait until it clears.

                         VIG
               You made the choice and we lost
               Troy --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I had no choice.

                         VIG
               You had a choice.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I had no fucking choice.

     He screams at Vig, who looks scared.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I can't walk away from a crime
               like that and take the gold and
               live my life like nothing
               happened, and if you can, then I
               hope you die right now.

     Vig starts crying. Doc hands a bandage to Archie, who puts it
     over Vig's wounded eye socket.

                         VIG
               What about Troy? What choice does
               he have now?

     PAN ACROSS the Man In Glasses wipes his daughter's face.

     EXT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     Iraqi soldiers strip Troy's clothes as he stands in front of
     Oasis Bunker surrounded only by fortress ruins in the desert.
     The Iraqi Interrogator pulls off his gas mask.

     Two Iraqi tanks are parked to the side. Small numbers of
     soldiers and civilians mill about.

                         IRAQI SOLDIER (SUBTITLES)
               Can we shoot him?

                         IRAQI SOLDIER #2 (SUBTITLES)
               We're not even supposed to have
               American prisoners.

                         INTERROGATOR (SUBTITLES)
               He's proof they broke the cease-
               fire.

     A GUN SHOT RINGS OUT. The Iraqis turn to look.

                         INTERROGATOR
               They're taking the tank.

     PAN TO 7 Shiites with rifles climb the unmanned Iraqi tank.
     4 Iraqi soldiers FIRE back at the Shiites.

     Troy, naked, tries to break away in the chaos. He runs a few
     feet, is tackled and dragged toward the bunker.

     EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE TANK

     Bill Smithson drives the motorcycle up and stops.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Start shooting, Paco.

                         WALTER
               I don't like this, we gotta go--

     Iraqi soldiers pull them off the motorcycle.

                         WALTER
               Hey.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Let me handle this.

     INT. NARROW CORRIDOR OF OASIS BUNKER

     Troy is led, naked, down the corridor by two soldiers.

     EXT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     Shiites rebels sit on top of the captured tank with rifles as
     it drives toward the bunker. Iraqi soldiers FIRE on them, but
     the turret aims at the bunker and FIRES -- blasting a hole.

     INT. BUNKER - CRUDE CEMENT BATHROOM - DAY

     Troy is thrown onto the floor of a cluttered cement bathroom
     with two crude toilets. His clothes are thrown on top of him.

                         IRAQI SOLDIER
               Get dress.

                         TROY
               OK.

                         IRAQI SOLDIER
               Get dress.

                         TROY
               I said OK.

     The door is slammed. Stolen blenders, radios, CDs, stacks of
     new Levis litter the floor. Troy kicks all the crap angrily
     and hundreds of cell phones tumble from a box.

     Troy looks at the pile of cell phones, picks one up, tries it
     for a dial tone, drops it, tries another, until he gets one
     that gives him a tone and dials.

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
               Jalam nafad.

     Troy looks stunned.

                         TROY
                      (into the cell phone)
               Um. Do you speak English?

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
                      (British accent)
               Yes.

                         TROY
                      (into cell phone)
               Can you -- I need --

     He frantically pushes stuff on the floor to block the door.

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
               What number, please.

                         TROY
               Operation Desert Storm.

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
               I'm sorry?

                         TROY
               The big army in the desert, come
               on, it's an emergency.

                         OPERATOR (O.S.)
               I don't have that number.

                         TROY
               Maybe you could -- hello?

     The phone is dead.

                         TROY
               Fuck.

     He throws it to the ground, tries another, no dial tone,
     throws it, tries another, no dial tone, throws it.

                         TROY
               Come on, come on, come on.

     He tries another, chucks it, another, gets a dial tone,
     dials, and waits. Troy dials a number.

     He waits while the PHONE RINGS.

     INT. TROY'S HOME - TORRANCE, CAL.- NIGHT

     Darlene, Troy's wife, tired from the pregnancy, picks up the
     RINGING TELEPHONE. She has a crying baby in her arm.

     INTERCUT with bunker:

                         DARLENE
                      (Southern accent)
               Hello?

                         TROY
               Honey, it's me.

                         DARLENE
               Troy?

                         TROY
               It's me, honey.

                         DARLENE
               My God, the baby's crying.

                         TROY
               I can hear her.

                         DARLENE
               That's our little Krystal.

                         TROY
               How's she doing?

                         DARLENE
               She hasn't been sleeping good, and
               Mamma had to go back to work, so
               I'm real, real tired, baby.

                         TROY
               I wish I was there to help, gooney-
               bird.

                         DARLENE
               Oh, gooney-bird, when are you
               coming home?

                         TROY
               I'm working on that right now,
               baby.

                         DARLENE
               I saw an ad for a computer job.
               You want me to call and set up an
               interview for my war hero?

                         TROY
               Listen, honey --

                         DARLENE
               What date are you coming home?

                         TROY
               They haven't given us an exact
               date yet. Listen --

                         DARLENE
               I'm henpecking you.

                         TROY
               No, you're not.

                         DARLENE
               I'm lonely and tired and most of
               all, I miss you.

                         TROY
               I miss you, too.

     FIRE and CONCRETE EXPLODE into one wall of the bathroom.

                         DARLENE
               What was that?

                         TROY
               The wall just exploded.

                         DARLENE
               I thought the war was over, honey.

                         TROY
               It is and it isn't, babe. Can you
               do me a favor and call the C.O. on
               base?

                         DARLENE
               You want me to call the C.O.?

                         TROY
               Tell him I'm stuck in a bunker
               near 223 north outside Karbala --

                         DARLENE
               What do you mean 'stuck'? I
               thought the war was over.

                         TROY
               I'm gonna be fine, honey, I don't
               want you to worry, I tried to do
               something for the family,  and I
               want you to know --

                         DARLENE
               Know what?

     Another MORTAR SMASHES through the wall, covers Troy in dust.

                         TROY
               That I love you.

                         DARLENE
               What's happening, Troy?

                         TROY
               Tell Krystal --

     Soldiers push at the door, trying to open it.

                         DARLENE
               Troy?

                         TROY
               Tell Krystal I'm a rich man and if
               things work out she'll be taken
               care of no matter what --

                         DARLENE
               What are you talking about?

     The door is kicked open and soldiers enter.

                         TROY
               Gotta go, gooney-bird, I love you--

     The soldiers punch Troy in the face, drag him from the room.

                         DARLENE
               Troy?

     She waits for a moment, tears in her eyes, and hangs up.

     INT. TV ROOM OF OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     A MORTAR ROCKS THE ROOM; soldiers frantically exit.

     'CNN' is left playing in the empty room with Bill Smithson's
     report from the previous day. "I Just Want to Celebrate"
     PLAYS:

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Spirits are high and the music is
               soaring as these young troops
               celebrate --

     EXT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     Iraqi soldiers shoulder-launch a rocket at the tank,
     EXPLODING it. Soldiers shoot into the flaming wreck.

     PULL BACK TO Bill Smithson and PACO, the cameraman.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               I'm being held captive by Iraqi
               troops in the gritty city of

                         PACO
               You said gritty city again.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               OK, we'll go again.

                         PACO
               What about Private Wogoman, Bill?

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Let's lay a few of these down
               first. In three, two, and, I'm
               being held captive in a gritty
               suburb of Karbala, where Shiite
               fundamentalists are rising up --

               Hey, that's the CNN guy.

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               Wow. He's much shorter in person.

                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
               Get them out of here now.

     LATER

     Walter sits on the bike, naked. Bill Smithson in the sidecar,
     Paco in the back. Iraqi soldiers pull the tape out.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               At least let me keep the tape.

                         WALTER
               Could I have my helmet, please?

     They hand him his socks.

                         WALTER
               Helmet. On my head.

     They give Walter his helmet, with built-in radio headset.

     EXT. U.S. COMPANY B CAMP - MESS AREA - DAY

                         GENERAL HORN
               Who's missing?

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Is Doc here?

     The White Assistant shakes his head 'NO.'

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Doc's not here?

                         GENERAL HORN
               You don't know where one of your
               own fucking aides is?

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               How about Barlow?

     The White Assistant shakes his head 'NO.'

                         GENERAL HORN
               Check all the radio transmissions.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               I run a tight company, Ron. Don't
               break my bails.

                         GENERAL HORN
               I'm not breaking your balls, Doug,
               I want to find these guys.

     INT. TUNNEL - DAY

     Archie, Doc, Vig, and dozens of Shiites crouch as they walk
     through the tunnel, single file.

     Dissolve

     They are still walking in the long tunnel.

     EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY

     Archie climbs out of a small mound in the desert, squints in
     the light and looks around.

     A strange minaret stretches skyward from the flat desert, 200
     yards away. The minaret is made of yellow stone, it twists
     150 feet into the air, like a twisting wedding cake.

     Archie leads the others toward the minaret. No one is around,
     except for a few black robes. Archie, Doc, and Vig enter the
     old wooden doorway of the ancient Minaret.

     INT. MINARET HALLWAY - DAY

     A line of TEN CHILDREN with missing limbs and bandages stand
     and watch Archie, Doc, and Vig enter. They make eye contact.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, OASIS BUNKER - DAY

     CLOSE UP: the hands of an Iraqi soldier carefully wrap a bare
     wire around Troy's right ear.

                         INTERROGATOR
                      (heavy accent)
               What is your rank, bro?

                         TROY
               Master sargeant.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Your company?

                         TROY
               B Company, infantry, United States
               Army.

     The wire is wrapped under Troy's chin around his other ear.

                         INTERROGATOR
               My main man. Tell me something,
               OK? What is problem with Michael
               Jackson?

                         TROY
               What do you mean?

                         INTERROGATOR
               The King of Pop. 'I'm bad, I'm
               bad, you know it --'

                         TROY
               Yeah, Michael Jackson.

                         INTERROGATOR
               He is fahking the small boys, man.

                         TROY
               What are you talking about?

                         INTERROGATOR
               He come to Egypt with the small
               boys. I see picture in newspaper,
               always he is with the small boys
               in the hotel window. Hello with
               the white glove. I am King of Pop
               in my hotel with the small boys.
               No girls. Just the boys.

                         TROY
               He likes kids.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Yeah, he like to fahk them up the
               ass.

                         TROY
               Bullshit.

     Troy is smashed in the face with a clipboard.  He looks
     angry, and like he could cry at the same time.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You are the blind bullshit, my
               main man.  It is so obvious he
               like the small boy so he all the
               time travel with them.

                         TROY
               Fine.

                         INTERROGATOR
               And if it really true? You say --

                         TROY
               I say it's sick.

                         INTERROGATOR
               That's because you got a sick
               country, bro, you got no respect
               for the children. That's why you
               bomb them over here, right?

                         TROY
               I don't think so.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Michael Jackson is Pop King of
               sick fahking country.

                         TROY
               Wrong.

     Troy is smashed in the face with the clip board.  Blood drips
     from his nose.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Bullshit wrong, dude. A black man
               make the skin white and the hair
               straight. You know why?

                         TROY
               No.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Your sick fahking country make the
               black man hate hisself, just like
               you hate the Arab and the children
               you bomb.

                         TROY
               I don't hate children.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Do they care, buddy?

                         TROY
               Does who care?

                         INTERROGATOR
               Do your army care about the Shiite
               children? Do they come to help?

                         TROY
               No, they're not coming.

     The Interrogator signals someone O.S. and suddenly voltage
     races through the wire, causing Troy to gnash his teeth
     together so hard they chip. He writhes in pain.

                         INTERROGATOR
                      (in subtitles)
               That seemed like too much volts.
               You got to build it up slow.

     A SECOND IRAQI gestures defensively at a console that is
     connected to the wire around Troy's jaw.  A THIRD IRAQI
     reaches forward and turns a dial.  The SECOND IRAQI murmurs
     defensively and turns the dial back.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Just figure it out.

     The Interrogator turns back to Troy.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Are they coming to help the Shiite?

                         TROY
               No.

     He is jolted again -- his face contorts, he bites his lip.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Tell the truth, dudesky. Save us
               the big bummer.

     Troy starts to cry, represses it. His lip is bleeding.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Does it hurt?

     Troy says nothing.

                         INTERROGATOR
               I ask you question, bro.

                         TROY
               Yes, it hurts.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You bomb my family. Do you know
               that?

     Troy starts shaking slightly.

                         INTERROGATOR
               You blow up my home. The whole
               street. My wife is crush by big
               fahking block of concrete. She
               lose her legs, bro, and she got
               nice legs, too. Those legs cut off
               now.

     Emotion comes into the INTERROGATOR'S VOICE as he says this.

                         TROY
                      (whispers)
               That's horrible.

                         INTERROGATOR
               What?

                         TROY
                      (whispers)
               I said, that's horrible.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Oh, my God, buddy. I didn't even
               told you the horrible part yet.

     The other two guards listen sadly.

                         INTERROGATOR
               My son was kill in his bed. Did
               you heard that, dude?

                         TROY
               Yes.

                         INTERROGATOR
               He is one years old. He is
               asleeping with his toy doll when.
               the bomb come. You see that guy
               over there?  He lose his daughter
               same way: big USA bomb.

     CLOSE UP the two guards -- one of them wipes away a tear.

     FANTASY - CONCRETE AND PLASTER

     falls onto the bed of a sleeping child.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

                         TROY
               I have a daughter.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Very nice for you, bro. She is
               safe in Ohio without the bombs and
               concrete and all this shit--

     FANTASY - DARLENE

     pushes a baby carriage down an idyllic tree-lined sidewalk.

                         INTERROGATOR (OS)
               How old is she?

                         TROY (OS)
               Ten days old.

                         INTERROGATOR (OS)
               What's her name?

     BACK TO THE SCENE

                         TROY
               Krystal.

                         INTERROGATOR
               What makes you decide to tell me
               about Krystal, my main man?

                         TROY
               Because we're both fathers.

                         INTERROGATOR
               I'm not a father no more, dude,
               remember? My son is dead now.

     INT. LARGE ROOM OF MINARET - DAY

     TWO DOZEN PEOPLE are laying down, being treated by SHIITE
     CLERICS in black who squeeze aloe onto facial blisters.

     At the end of the hall, Archie grits his teeth in pain as a
     CLERIC uses a turkey baster to shoot alcohol into his
     infected wound. Archie SCREAMS in pain.

     Doc paces, exhaling; he has white ointment on his face.

                         DOC
               I'm OK. I'm cool. I'm a survivor.

     A Shiite changes Vig's bloody bandage, while a DEAD BODY is
     laid next to Vig and wrapped in cloths; two clerics chant.

                         VIG
               Is that guy dead? Where you gonna
               put him?

                         SHIITE CLERIC
               A shrine.

                         VIG
               What kind of shrine ya'll got?

                         SHIITE CLERIC
               Shrine that wash 700 year of sin.

                         VIG
               Hey, that's a pretty good shrine,
               right, Doc?

     Doc stares at Vig.

                         VIG
               I'm sorry I hit you, man. I was
               scared for Troy, I don't want
               nothing to happen to him, he's my
               friend. Doc? Come on, man, I know
               you was comin' to help me --

     Vig reaches out blindly for Doc's hand. Doc looks for a
     moment at Vig's hand in the air, reaching, then takes it.
     They remain silent for a moment, hands clasped.

                         VIG
               Maybe we got kicked out of the
               ring of Jesus fire, on account of
               stealing.

                         DOC
               That's not how it works.

                         VIG
               How does it work?

                         DOC
               I take care of what Jesus puts in
               front of me. That's what we did
               with the gold.

                         VIG
               What about now?

                         DOC
               I'm gonna see.

     Archie walks up, his arm bandaged, and inspects Vig's face.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               How you doing, Conrad?

                         VIG
               I'm good to go, chief.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Let's check the suitcases.

     Archie, Doc, and Vig check the Vuitton suitcases, opening
     them, looking at the gold, shutting them.

     PAN TO children in bandages watch Archie inventory the gold.

                         DOC
               We're missing 28.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That leaves 92 suitcases, five
               bars each --

     They think.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               23 million dollars. Not bad for a
               disaster, provided we can find
               Barlow, get back before dark and
               not get busted.

     He looks at Doc and Vig.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It was my choice today. So you can
               head back if you want. I'll find
               Barlow myself.

                         DOC
               What about the gold?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Take what you can carry. Try to
               find a vehicle. Bury what you have
               outside camp. Be careful about it.

     They look at Archie.

                         VIG
               I want to find Troy.

     Doc thinks.

                         DOC
               I'm in.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               OK, where does that leave us? We
               don't have any water, we're
               dehydrated. You got a radio here?

     The Shiite Man In Glasses puts oils on his Little Girl's face.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               How is she?

     The Shiite Man In Glasses does not answer.

                         DOC
               How -- is -- your -- little
               girl?

     Vig wears glasses over his eye bandage; he mimes the Girl.

                         VIG
               Broken -- arms. Girl.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               She's traumatized, what the fuck
               do you expect?

     They look at him, surprised.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               I went to b-school at Bowling
               Green.

               I came back to open a couple of
               hotels near Karbala. I'm almost in
               the black when Saddam starts this
               stupid fucking war and you guys
               bomb the shit out of my cafes. Now
               we try to get rid of Saddam, Bush
               leaves us twisting in the wind, Un-
               be-fucking-lievable man.

               You got a radio?

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               No radio. No water.

     He wipes bits of white foam from the corners of his mouth.

               Where's Barlow?

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               They got him, I saw it happen. And
               they won't take him back to the
               same place.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Where would they take him?

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Oasis Bunker. It's full of

               Take us there.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               We got no wheels.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We'll walk until we find some.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Why don't you call in the Marines?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               With what? We don't have a radio.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               OK, we'll find a vehicle. You
               drive back to get the choppers,
               they fly in to get your man.

     Doc and Vig look at Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We can't do that.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Why not? You got a huge army here.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're not supposed to be involved
               with Shiites. We killed Iraqi
               soldiers. We broke the peace-
               accord.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Tell them it happened when you
               reclaimed the gold. Don't tell
               them it was about us.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They'd find out, we'd go to jail.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               You know what I think? I think
               maybe you're boosting the gold.
               That's what I think.

     Archie looks at him.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You're wrong.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               They got half a million men in the
               desert, they send four guys to
               pick up all this bullion? I don't
               think so.

     Archie looks at Vig and Doc.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We need to find our man. How much
               do you want to take us there?

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Fifteen suitcases.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's too much.

                         VIG
               Give it to him. We've got a lot.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're gonna need it to buy our way
               back today, so we better spend it
               wisely. I'll give you eight.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               You need some guns, right? You
               lost your gear.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Yeah, we need some guns.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               You need some fighters, too. I
               mean, you can try to take Oasis on
               your own, but look at these
               grunts --

     Doc and Vig look pissed. Archie's arm is in pain.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Yeah, OK, we need some fighters.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               So that's worth more than eight
               suitcases.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Ten.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               Fifteen.

     Archie looks at him.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               That's four million dollars.

                         MAN IN GLASSES
               I think we need it more than you,
               John Doe, don't you?

     He extends his hand. They shake.

               Imam Katar. I'll give you back
               five suitcases to get us over the
               Iranian border.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               What?

                         IMAM
               We gotta get to a refugee camp or
               we're dead. The camps are in Iran.

                         DOC
               We can't go to the Iranian border.

                         IMAM
               Then we don't have a deal.

                         VIG
               Give me a fucking break, man.

                         DOC
               We saved your life.

                         IMAM
               And we saved yours.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We lost a man for you.

                         IMAM
               What good is it if you leave us to
               get wasted? The big army of
               democracy beats the ugly dictator,
               saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you
               go to jail if you help us escape
               the same dictator.  You saw what
               happened to my wife. Look at my
               daughter.

     Archie looks around. He sees Imam's daughter, other bandaged
     children looking at him. A few mothers.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Who's going?

                         IMAM
               Everyone but the priests. That's
               55.

                         VIG
               Fuck it. We'll find this place on
               our own.

                         IMAM
               It's not on a map. You can look.

                         DOC
               Somebody else will take us.

     Doc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up

                         DOC
               Who will take us to Oasis bunker?

     Fifty Shiites turn and look at him silently. Doc dumps a
     whole suitcase of gold bars. Imam translates.

                         IMAM
               Jarat yalam fantam uraz.

     People stare at the gold and say nothing.

                         IMAM
               I don't think so.

                         VIG
               This is a human life we're talking
               about.

                         IMAM
                      (laughs)
               Tell me about it.

     His daughter looks at him and laughs -- until her laughter
     becomes scary, hysterical and Imam tries to hold her still
     and she won't stop as Archie, Doc, Vig watch.

     INT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY

               I only join Saddam Hussein army to
               make good living for family, good

                         INTERROGATOR
               We got a lot in common, dude. I
               got training and guns from America.

                         TROY
               Not from America.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Oh, yeah, specialist guys come to
               Iraq, train us when we fight Iran.

                         TROY
               What did they train you in?

                         INTERROGATOR
               Weapons, sabotage. Interrogation.

                         TROY
               Great.

     The Interrogator lights a Marlboro, exhales.

     PUSH IN TO CLOSE UP on TROY'S FACE as the smoke envelopes him.

     FANTASY -- INT. TROY'S BEDROOM - TORRANCE

     Darlene looks up and beams as Troy walks into the room, they
     embrace on the bed.

                         INTERROGATOR (O.S.)

                         TROY
               Right.

     Interrogator laughs and takes a practice golf swing.

                         TROY
               So why are you doing this to me?

                         INTERROGATOR
               It's my job, man, for Saddam, just
               like your job when you bomb my
               house.

                         TROY
               It's not just a job, it still
               matters what you do.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Bullshit. It's all a job.

                         TROY
               It still matters what you do, what
               you're doing right now matters.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Bullshit.

                         TROY
               The art of war is not for killing
               people, it's a stratagem to give
               life to many with minimum
               violence, minimum --

                         INTERROGATOR
               Then why you bomb my fahking house
               and kill my son? Can you think how
               it feels inside your heart if I
               bomb your daughter?

               Worse than death --

                         INTERROGATOR
               It feels like this --

     Holding the driver at the head, he raps the bridge of Troy's
     nose.

                         TROY
               Don't --

                         INTERROGATOR
               Everyday, inside my heart --

     He raps Troy's nose repeatedly to make his point.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Like this, like this, like this --

     He breaks Troy's nose with a crack.

     INT. MINARET

     A rug is pulled off the old stone floor, a panel is lifted.
     Old pistols and rifles are pulled out.

     Doc and Vig load and handle the old pistols.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Did we save anything from the
               Humvee?

                         DOC
               This bag.

     Archie pulls two of the colored footballs from the beat up
     pack. He looks at Doc as if to say "Great."

     LATER

     Archie's arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of
     light blue plastic explosive around a football, presses small
     nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a fuse in the
     end of the ball. Another ball-bomb just like it has already
     been constructed.

     EXT. DESERT -  DAY

     Archie leads a line of 55 Shiites across the desert. Everyone
     carries at least one Vuitton bag. Imam carries his daughter.

                         VIG
               You got the same name as the tall
               model who does David Bowie.

                         DOC
               That's Im-an, with an 'n.' He's
               Imam with an 'm.'

                         VIG
               That's the same name.

                         DOC
               It's not the same name.

                         VIG
               Whatever. They're both attractive
               names.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     Archie crouches low to the ground, moving quickly,
     secretively. He turns and makes a hand signal to, Doc, 20
     yards away, who turns and makes a hand signal to Vig.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT: A lone Iraqi military truck, mint condition.'

     Archie, Vig, and Doc form a semicircle, surrounding the
     truck. They are all 40 yards back from the truck.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               This is the United States Army.
               Come out of the truck with your
               weapons in the air.

     No response. Suddenly Vig's pistol FIRES.

                         VIG
               Shit. Sorry.

     His gunshot blows a hole in the Iraqi truck -- which deflates
     like a huge beach ball, circling wildly until it lies in a
     heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while 50 yards away --
     55 SHIITES flip sand-colored blankets off and stand up in the
     desert to look. Doc lifts the limp canvass of the deflated
     truck.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They used a lot of decoys to throw
               off our bombers.

                         DOC
               Where are we gonna get a vehicle?

                         IMAM
               I know a place that's full of
               deserters. Maybe they got
               something.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT: They walk in a single file line in the
     desert.  Archie in front, carries a Vuitton bag.

     EXT. DESERTER'S BUNKER - DAY

     Archie now walks among Shiites toting old rifles. There are
     bomb craters, destroyed cars, a few mud dwellings nearby.

                         SHIITE
               America!

                         SHIITE #2
               America! Friend!

                         SHIITE
               Freedom! Thank you to America!

     Shiites cheer and pat Archie, Doc and Vig on the back as they
     walk to a bunker built into the side of a small hill. TWO
     IRAQI SOLDIERS come out smiling to embrace a disoriented
     Archie and Doc.

     INT. IRAQI BUNKER - DAY

     They pass through a cluttered room with six cots, down a
     hallway, to a larger room where two more YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIERS
     sit watching CNN. There is a defaced poster of Saddam, two
     peacocks and three monkeys in the room, and the half-eaten
     carcass of a zebra. The soldiers rise and half-bow to Archie.

     INT. BUNKER GARAGE - DAY

     It is dark. With a click, several bare ceiling lights come
     on. Archie, Doc, Vig, stare in amazement: It's an underground
     garage filled with nine luxury cars: A ROLLS ROYCE, a JAGUAR,
     a MERCEDES, an INFINITI CONVERTIBLE, FOUR CADILLACS, a WHITE
     STRETCH LIMOUSINE. The friendly Iraqi smiles.

     Doc stops at the convertible.

     Vig looks uneasy. Archie hums Bach's 'Gloria' and moves a
     hand in the air, then puts his hands on Vig's shoulders and
     SINGS THE BACH LOUD. Vig eventually joins in the chorus.

               And then you are crazy to bomb all

                         TROY
               Too much bombing is crazy, but not

               No, for stability. Stabilize the
               region.

     The Interrogator pulls a CD from Troy's pocket and jams it
     into Troy's mouth.

                         INTERROGATOR
               This is your fahking stability, my
               main man.

     The Interrogator uses the CD as a funnel to force-feed the
     crude oil into Troy's mouth as he pours it from the bucket.

     EXT. RIM OF DUNE OVERLOOKING OASIS BUNKER

     Archie, Doc, Vig, stand on a sand ridge and look down on the
     Oasis bunker in the distance. Behind them are the three cars,
     Imam, and a handful of Shiite gunmen. They get into the cars.

     EXT. DUNES

     An empty ridge. The Infiniti, Rolls, Mercedes shoot over it,
     arcing down toward the bunker, engines roaring.

     EXT. OASIS BUNKER

     It is quiet. A Slim Jim is unwrapped as an IRAQI GUARD slowly
     raises it to his mouth, bites it, chews, and looks puzzled at
     the cars approaching in the distance.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT - looking straight down.

     The cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the
     bunker. The Infiniti is in the middle, flanked by the Rolls
     on the left and the Mercedes on the right.

     INT. INFINITI

     Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward
     the bunker. A Shiite sits up front with him. Fifty yards from
     the bunker, Vig turns sharply and drives in circles.

     EXT. BUNKER

     TWO IRAQI GUARDS, one chewing a Slim Jim, look bewildered as
     they stare at the circling Infiniti fifty yards away.

     INT. MERCEDES

     Archie, with Imam in the passenger seat, two Shiites in back,
     speeds the Mercedes past the guards, around the right side,
     to the back side of the bunker, skidding across the sand.

     AERIAL VIEW

     The Mercedes and the Rolls diverge around the bunker on
     either side: Rolls on the left, Mercedes on the right.

     INT. ROLLS ROYCE

     Doc drives the Rolls around the left, to the bunker's rear.

     EXT. BUNKER

     Iraqi soldiers fire a grenade that blows up right behind the
     Rolls as Doc skids right up to a rear entrance of the bunker,
     the grill touching the metal door. Doc parks, blockading the
     rear door shut, and, with three Shiite riflemen, jumps out.

     INT. INFINITI

     A Shiite helps Vig wedge a piece of wood onto the gas pedal.
     Vig suddenly grabs his hand in PAIN. The Shiite looks at him.

                         VIG
               Splinter.

                         SHIITE
               Come on.

     EXT. INFINITI

     Vig and the Shiite bail out of the moving Infiniti. Wads of
     plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it
     speeds towards the bunker, then drifts to the side --

                         VIG
               Go straight, go straight --

     He jumps up and down and points, but the Infiniti goes far to
     the side of the bunker and explodes into some ruins. The two
     guards point their guns at Vig and the Shiite and they run
     into the desert as bullets pop around them.

     EXT. RIGHT SIDE OF BUNKER

     Archie skids the Mercedes to a halt on the right side of the
     bunker, jumps out, slams the door, followed by Imam and the
     two other Shiites.

     They run toward the bunker, Archie with a wad of plastic
     explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in
     the other. He HEARS the CHIRP of a car alarm being activated
     as he runs to the bunker.

     Imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker, pulls
     off a grill. Archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic
     explosive, and drops it into the vent.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Troy gags and spits, his front is covered in oil. The
     Interrogator raises the bucket.

                         INTERROGATOR
               Are you feeling stable enough for
               more?

     An EXPLOSION elsewhere in the bunker causes the lights to
     flicker out.

     INT. BUNKER CORRIDOR

     Iraqi soldiers scurry in the darkness with flashlights. They
     go to the rear door, pile up in the dark, pushing.

     EXT. REAR OF BUNKER

     The parked Rolls Royce blockades the rear door.

     EXT. SIDE OF BUNKER

     Archie and Imam run back to the Mercedes, but the car is
     locked, his pistol sits inside on the front seat. A GUNSHOT
     from the bunker roof shatters the window of the Mercedes,
     setting off THE CAR ALARM.

     Archie reaches in, grabs his pistol, and bolts as a launched
     grenade blows the Mercedes.

     EXT. FRONT OF BUNKER - DAY

     12 Iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as 3 Shiite
     riflemen with Doc fire on them. Two Iraqis go down, with only
     the sound of bullets piercing their flesh.

     6 Iraqis run for it, into the desert. 2 Iraqis throw their
     hands up in surrender while 2 look ambivalent, one holds a
     stack of new Levis. Doc raises a hand to stop his Shiite
     gunmen from firing, but they fire anyway and 3 Iraqis fire
     back -- the Shiite next to Doc is hit in the face.

                         DOC
               Stop shooting, what's the matter
               with you?

     He reaches out and holds the rifle of a Shiite. Everyone
     stops firing, slowly the Iraqis drop their guns. Doc has WET
     HIS PANTS.

     Archie runs up from the right, grabs Doc's arm and they run
     past surrendering Iraqi soldiers and into the front entrance.
     of the bunker. Imam takes cover on the side of the bunker
     while Shiites and Iraqis aim at each other.

     Vig approaches cautiously from the desert, HEARS AN AIRCRAFT,
     and looks up. An Iraqi helicopter comes in fast and opens
     FIRE with MACHINE GUNS --

                         VIG
               Shit.

     Vig runs toward the bunker for cover, but is cut off by
     MACHINE GUN FIRE from THE CHOPPER. Shiites FIRE rifles up at
     the chopper.

     INT. IRAQI CHOPPER

     Chips of metal and plastic fly off as bullets hit the
     chopper. Arabic chatter is heard over a crackling radio.

     POV - FROM INSIDE THE CHOPPER

     100 feet below -- Vig and six remaining Shiite riflemen are
     running into the desert away from the chopper.

     EXT. DESERT -  DAY

     Vig and the six Shiites frantically search for cover.

     The chopper FIRES and one of the Shiites running with Vig is
     hit in the head, thrown by the force of the gunshot into Vig,
     who goes down, faking it.

     Vig lies face down, out of breath, with the dead Shiite on
     top of him while the chopper hovers above.

                         VIG
               Jesus God, I don't wanna get hit,
               please Jesus, watch over me --

     INT. BUNKER

     It is dimly lighted by a few mounted emergency lights.

     Archie and Doc run down the empty stairs, through the big
     main room -- it is empty. Archie goes down the right side,
     kicks open a door --

     It's the bathroom full of stolen stuff and cell phones --

     Doc goes down the left side of the room -- kicks in a door --
     a room full of Benneton sweaters in all colors.

     Archie kicks in a door -- a room with shelves full of large
     snow globes, thousands of them.

     Doc kicks in a door -- a room cluttered with debris, but
     there is another door at the far side of the room. He
     approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.

     Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency
     light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi
     torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the
     emergency light with a screwdriver --

     In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely
     in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN
     POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.

     Archie turns to the Interrogator, who stands next to Troy.

                         INTERROGATOR
               It's OK, buddy, we are just
               talking now --

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Archie shoots the Interrogator in the
     thigh. THE ONLY SOUND IS GUN SHOOTING, FLESH TEARING --

     Blood thinly splatters across Troy's face as the Interrogator
     grimaces and falls to the floor. The light flicks on a few
     beats, then off a few beats.

     Archie rips the wires from the table controls, goes to Troy,
     unhinges the wire from his jaw.

     The Interrogator writhes in pain on the ground. Archie takes
     the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord
     binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol.

     Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears. He gets up, looks
     down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into
     the Interrogator's face.

     The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back. Archie
     watches, out of breath. Troy FIRES the gun just to the side
     of the Interrogator's face, into the ground. The Interrogator
     looks terrified, crying. Troy stares back, looks unhappy,
     lowers the gun.

     Troy and Archie look at each other for an intense moment.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Let's go.

     INT. ANOTHER BUNKER ROOM

     Doc shoots the lock on the inner door and it finally opens.
     He looks inside and sees, in a sunken room, 50 more Shiite
     civilians huddled together. Archie rushes by with Troy.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Come on.

     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     Archie and Troy run out of the bunker --

     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     The chopper hovers right there. It FIRES A GRENADE which
     EXPLODES next to Archie and Troy. They scramble back into the
     bunker.

     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     Archie and Troy run into Doc at the door, knocking him over.
     They crouch inside the door; the chopper hovers low outside.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands
     and knees with the dead Shiite on his back.

                         VIG
               You gotta be my disguise, Mr.
               Shiite, cuz they need my help over
               there --

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     The six Iraqis who took oft from the bunker are still
     running. Their CONVERSATION is in ARABIC and SUBTITLED in
     ENGLISH.

                         TOUGH IRAQI
               Let's go back and get them.

                         IRAQI #2
               Fuck a donkey, no way.

                         TOUGH IRAQI
               There's a chopper, we can do it.

     He and another Iraqi stop while the other two keep running.

                         TOUGH IRAQI
               They killed your families, you
               fucking cowards.

     The Tough Iraqi and his partner, sweating profusely, out of
     breath, split up and head back toward the bunker.

     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     Archie's in great pain. He grimaces as he tightens the
     bandage around his forearm. Troy is shaking uncontrollably.
     Doc grabs Troy's shoulders firmly.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're gonna get out of here alive,
               just do what I say, do you hear me?

     Troy nods. Archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in
     C-4 from his small pack, and hands it to Doc.

     Archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Step, throw, one-two -- I'm gonna
               give it a five second fuse. That
               gives you two steps out the door.

     PAN ACROSS Troy and Doc listen intently.

     Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.

     The three of them stand at the door, ready. Archie holds his
     pistol ready. Doc holds the football, Troy holds the lighter.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Wait --

     EXT. BUNKER

     Imam, lying in a ditch, is concealed on the side of the
     bunker, and aims an old rifle at the chopper.

     GUNSHOTS ring off the side of the chopper, chipping plastic.
     The chopper banks toward Vig in response.

     Vig watches the chopper turn toward him.

                         VIG
               God help me.

     INT. BUNKER

     Troy flicks the lighter and with a shaking hand tries to
     light the fuse. Archie steadies Troy's hand. The fuse is lit.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Go.

     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

     Archie FIRES his pistol as he goes out the door with Troy,
     also FIRING a pistol. Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning.
     Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up.

     INT. CHOPPER

     The chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the
     plexiglas window and bounces off, not exploding. The pilots
     look perplexed. The ball hits the ground and EXPLODES.

     EXT. BUNKER

     Archie, Troy, Doc, stunned -- turn back to the bunker.

     INT. BUNKER DOORWAY - DAY

     They run inside and take cover, catch their breath. Troy and
     Doc look terrified.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               OK.  Shorter fuse this time.

     He pulls out the second ball, cuts another fuse, affixes it.
     They wait at the door again, watching the chopper.

     EXT. BUNKER

     Imam, from the side of the bunker, FIRES again, the chopper
     swivels toward him to RETURN FIRE --

     INT. BUNKER

     Troy lights the second fuse. They bolt out the door, Troy and
     Archie FIRING pistols, Doc in the middle with the ball.

     EXT. BUNKER

     SLOW TO FREEZE FRAME MID-STRIDE -- with just THE SOUND OF THE
     CHOPPER: Archie, Doc, Troy, three abreast, mid-stride.

     RESUME REGULAR SPEED -- Doc unleashes the football.

     PAN TO - SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- the ball hits the chopper
     broadside and THE CHOPPER EXPLODES INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: The chopper comes crashing to the
     ground in a heap of metal. The rotary spins off, whips over
     Archie, Troy, and Doc's heads and smashes into the bunker.

     Silence.

     Troy and Doc look at each other, and punch their fists
     together. Troy notices that he's wet his pants.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're not done. Check every Iraqi
               here.

     Archie rolls over bodies lying on the ground, pulls out their
     weapons. Troy and Doc take rifles from wounded Iraqis.

                         TROY
                      (agitated)
               Where's Conrad?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Don't let your guard down.

     Doc nervously scans the area with his pistol pointed.

     50 Shiite prisoners start streaming out of the bunker.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Stay there, don't move.

     Imam directs the Shiites to stay clustered near the bunker.

                         IMAM
               Jakar yizam ut naral --

                         TROY
               How are we getting back?

                         DOC
               We got the Rolls.

     An IRAQI SOLDIER jumps up just as Archie knocks him to the
     ground from behind and twists the gun away. Doc binds the
     soldier's hands with a plastic cuff.

                         TROY
               You got a Rolls?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It's been a busy day.

     Archie pulls pistols from the bloody bodies of the two Iraqis
     in the chopper.

                         TROY
               Hey. That's a convertible.

     He points to the flaming wrecked Infiniti.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Keep your fucking guard up.

                         TROY
               Is that leather interior?

                         DOC
               I think he's in shock.

                         TROY
               It's a fucking Infiniti
               convertible, isn't it?

                         DOC
               Yes.

                         TROY
               OK. So I owe you a car. I'm not in
               shock.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We can talk about cars later, OK?

                         TROY
               Freeze --

     He points his pistol at Imam.

                         IMAM
               Take it easy.

                         TROY
               Who is this guy?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               He's with us.

     Troy and Imam look at each other a moment, Troy still points
     his pistol at Imam.

                         TROY
               You're the guy with the little
               girl.

                         IMAM
               That's right.

                         TROY
               What are you doing here?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               He helped us find you.

                         TROY
               All right. You're all right.

     He hugs Imam.

                         TROY
               How's your girl?

                         IMAM
               She's safe. For the moment.

                         TROY
               All right. Excellent. How can we
               help?

                         DOC
               Calm down, man.

                         TROY
               I'm calm. Don't I look calm?

                         IMAM
               We had a deal to get us to the
               border, but we need more vehicles
               for these people.

     Troy moves nervously.

                         TROY
               We're gonna work it out. We can do
               it. We have to work it out.

                         DOC
               I'm not sure how. This is a lot of
               people.

                         TROY
               OK, you choose who we take. You
               tell the others it's not
               convenient, they'll have to die.

                         DOC
               Take it easy, man.

                         TROY
               You think I don't know what I'm
               saying. I know what I'm saying.
               We're gonna do more than steal,
               that's what I'm saying. We're
               gonna help these people out.

                         IMAM
               This guy was worth saving.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               He's a soldier.

     Troy and Archie look at each other, smile slightly.

                         VIG (O.S.)
               Yes. Yes. All right.

     They all turn to look.

     WIDE SHOT -- Vig pops up in the desert, 150 yards away.

                         VIG
               You made it.

     Vig comes running.

                         VIG
               I thought that was you. Yeah.

     Troy smiles as he steps in the direction of Vig. Suddenly a
     RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY
     THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is
     jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering
     toward Troy, 125 yards away.

     Troy looks stunned.

     Archie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle.

     An IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground
     as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire.

     Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cover him.

     Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie
     scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Lock it down. Shoot anything that
               moves.

                         IMAM
                      (translates)
               Haza janav yasat.

     Troy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and
     embraces him. Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's
     shoulder, as Vig tries to talk.

                         VIG
               You made it, man --

     Troy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms.

                         TROY
               Help him.

     Doc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the
     ground, cradling his head in his lap. Vig spits blood.

                         VIG
               What happened to the Jesus fire,
               Doc?

                         DOC
               It's around you right now, man, it
               works on this side or the other
               side.

                         VIG
               You never told me that part. I
               guess I could go to one of them
               shrines that erase the bad you
               did --

                         TROY
               We made the right choice today,
               Conrad.

                         VIG
               We did good, right?

                         TROY
               We made the right choice.

     The hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. Troy puts
     his hands over it. Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to
     turns Vig's head to help him breathe.

                         DOC
               Dear Lord watch over this man,
               help him if you can. Our father
               who art in heaven --

     50 Shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near
     the bunker watch from afar.

     Troy stands up looking around helplessly.

                         TROY
               Help.

                         DOC
               -- hallowed be thy name, thy
               kingdom come, thy will be done --

     A gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy
     in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches
     over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the
     sound of tearing tissue. Troy looks stunned as he is spun
     around by the shot.

     Archie spins around in the desert and looks at Troy.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Goddamn it.

     He runs hard across the desert toward Troy.

     Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other.

     Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great
     difficulty -- RASPING.

     INT. TROY'S RIB CAGE

     His breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to
     the left side.

     TROY'S POV

     looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but
     there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING

     The POV turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing.

     FLASHBACK TO THE OPENING SCENE, but with weird, MUFFLED
     SOUND

                         SOLDIER #5
               Take my picture.

                         VIG
               Do you still want to sell pictures?

                         TROY
                      (distracted monotone)
               For twenty.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Twenty bucks?

                         VIG
               War's been over five days, ain't
               gonna be any more of this, Jim.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Twenty dollars, man, what's the
               meaning of life?

                         TROY
               You're lucky you got to see
               anybody shot in this war.

                         SOLDIER #5
               Bobby, take my picture.

     He holds the camera out.

                         SOLDIER #4
               If he shot the guy, it's up to him.

                         SOLDIER #5
               It's not like he shot a fucking
               deer. It's the enemy.

                         VIG
               It's Troy's enemy, yours for
               twenty.

     BACK TO THE SCENE - CLOSE UP

     Troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide.

     TROY'S POV

     Archie and Imam step into frame. Archie looks down at Troy,
     opens his waist pack, pulls out a sterile wrapped scalpel.

     TROY'S POV TURNS TO THE SIDE --

     FISH EYE LENS - The Jaguar pulls up in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.

     Imam's Little Girl gets out of the passenger side, SLIGHTLY
     SLOW MOTION, NO SOUND. Imam scolds her and gesticulates,
     indicating she should be back with the others where it is
     safe. The Little Girl embraces Imam and stares down at Troy
     over her father's shoulder.

     EXT. DESERT

     Troy's eyes are wide, staring up at the Girl as he has great
     difficulty breathing. Archie rolls Troy's shirt up, exposing
     Troy's chest, with the bullet wound. Archie points to a spot
     on Troy's upper chest, near the collar bone --

     Doc squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel onto this
     spot -- the only sounds are the squirt of the ointment and
     Troy's breathing.

     Archie looks nervous, then focussed as he brings the shiny
     metal scalpel down. Troy is in great pain as he watches
     Archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest. Archie twists
     the scalpel to open the incision wide --

     There is a pronounced HISSING as trapped air rushes out. Huge
     relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally.

     Regular sound FADES BACK IN, THE FIRST SOUND IS THE GIRL'S
     THIN, INTERMITTENT HUMMING --

     TROY'S POV FROM THE GROUND, LOOKING UP

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I've been waiting 18 years to get
               that right.

     He tears open a short I.V. tube and plunges the I.V. into the
     scalpel hole. There is a small valve on the end of the tube,
     which he tightens.

     A GUNSHOT SOUNDS -- Archie turns and looks over --

     EXT. DESERT

     FIVE SHIITE RIFLE MEN chase down and shoot, at 30 yards, the
     last Iraqi gunner in the desert.

     Troy sits up slowly and watches for a moment.

     EXT. FRONT OF THE BUNKER - LATER

     Shiite women and children chant and pray around Vig's corpse
     as it lies in the open trunk of the Jaguar. Archie, Troy and
     Doc stand together watching. Troy and Doc do a muted version
     of Vig's Karate arm dance as they look down at his corpse.

                         TROY
               He's got no family.

     Archie sadly takes Vig's big pistol from Vig's clenched hand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We're his family now.

                         DOC
               He wanted to go to one of those
               shrines.

                         IMAM
               Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.

     Archie takes Vig's glasses off.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Good. Take him.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     Archie fills a single rusted oil drum with gold bars and
     tapes it shut. Troy sits in a folding chair nearby. He looks
     pained and uncomfortable.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Air pressure will build up about
               every fifteen minutes. Release the
               valve, close it up again.

     Archie unscrews the valve on the tube in Troy's chest, and
     air hisses out. Troy looks relieved. Archie closes the valve.

                         TROY
               How long can I keep doing this?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Maybe four hours, if you're not
               bleeding too bad inside.

                         TROY
               I'm really thirsty.

                         DOC
               There's no water anywhere.

                         IMAM
                      (to Archie)
               I got you hooked up if you want to
               call your man.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     Archie operates a radio hooked up to a car battery.

                         ARCHIE GATES
                      (into the radio)
               Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do
               you read me?

                         DOC
               We're gonna be court-martialed.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               No, we're not.

     Troy watches, tense.

                         ARCHIE GATES
                      (into the radio)
               Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are
               you reading this?

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Walter drives the motorcycle, nude, wearing his helmet with
     radio attachment. Smithson and Paco ride along.

     Archie is heard in a crackling radio transmission inside
     Walter's helmet. Walter speaks into the small mouthpiece.

                         WALTER
                      (into radio)
               This is Tar Baby, come in.

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               Where are you?

                         WALTER
                      (into radio)
               About two clicks outside camp.

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               We're about ready for the briar
               patch, over.

                         WALTER
                      (into the radio)
               Right.

     He looks uncertain, worried.

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               You got me, Tar Baby?

                         WALTER
               I think so -- who handles the
               briar patch?

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               You do.

                         WALTER
               Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to
               the briar patch if everything's
               OK, right?

                         ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
               No, the other way around.

                         WALTER
               Shit, I'm sorry, sir, I don't
               remember how the code goes --

     INTERCUT WITH Archie, who looks exasperated. He is sweating
     with a fever and his arm hurts.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Six personnel trucks and a Humvee.

                         WALTER
               Wow. That's a tall order for a
               secret operation, sir.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Talk to my friend Hash. Each
               driver will get 100K.

                         WALTER
               Did you say 100K?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North.
               Add one medavac pack to the order,
               and dump the reporter.

                         WALTER
               Roger. Give me two hours.

     INT. COMPANY B RADIO TENT - DAY

     TWO DECODERS sit at a table wearing headphones. One writes
     down: "BRER RABBIT AT 239 NORTH, DUMP THE REPORTER."

     INT. BUNKER - DAY

     CLOSE UP A SNOW GLOBE is shaken and little green dollars
     swirl inside the little world, settling upon an early desert
     oasis, old buildings, palm trees, donkeys, Three Kings,
     peasants carrying the baby Jesus, and a Mobil gas station.

     WIDER TO REVEAL HUNDREDS OF SNOW GLOBES are pulled from the
     shelves and put into old cloth bags.

     EXT. BUNKER - DAY

     Doc cracks open a snow globe with pliers as all the water and
     dollars drain out. Imam filters the water through a cheese
     cloth held above an urn.

     CLOSE ON the plastic Three Kings and Baby Jesus with the
     Mobil gas station glisten in the wet palm of Archie's hand.

     Archie looks at the Three Kings in his hand.

     Troy cracks open a snow globe, filters water with a Shiite.

     Dozens of Shiites are doing the same.

     Archie passes an urn to some parched Shiites who drink the
     water thirstily. Troy, Doc do the same.

     EXT. B COMPANY RADIO TENT - DAY

     Captain Van Meter, General Horn, and two radio decoders stand
     looking at logs of transmissions.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               There's so many transmissions --

                         GENERAL HORN
               Narrow it down to what sounds like
               Archie Gates and a Humvee.

     A Humvee with HAVICHON and Walter drives by behind the
     oblivious General, leading a convoy of several trucks.

                         GENERAL HORN
               I want a direction, we're not
               gonna comb the whole goddamn
               desert --

     A PRIVATE runs up and hands General Horn a paper.

                         PRIVATE
               This is from Barlow's C.O. at Fort
               Bragg, something with his wife.

                         GENERAL HORN
                      (reads)
               Fort Bragg? I'll be damned.

     Walter and Hash drive past Smithson and Paco and Cathy.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               Where the hell is he going now?

                         CATHY DAITCH
               I say we keep watching the General.

     She takes off and Smithson follows her.

     EXT. DESERT -  DAY

     Imam pours gasoline on a pile of Vuitton suitcases,
     Troy throws a match, the suitcases go up in a rush of fire.

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     Imam hands two gold bars to a Shiite peasant, who takes them
     and moves on. There are two long lines of Shiite peasants
     patiently waiting to get their gold, as it is handed out by
     Imam and another Shiite while, Archie, Troy, and Doc watch.
     Shiites stash their gold bars inside their clothing and bags.

     LATER

     Everyone sits and waits: Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his
     daughter, 105 Shiite peasants.

     Troy looks pained, then releases the valve on the tube
     sticking through his chest bandage and there is a hiss of
     air. He looks relieved.

     There is the SOUND OF DISTANT MOTORS RUMBLING. An approaching
     convoy in the desert: six open U.S. personnel trucks, led by
     a Humvee.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, dozens of Shiites
     watch the convoy approaching -- they hold their guns ready.

     The U.S. Military trucks and the Humvee pull up to the bunker.

     Walter stands in the front of the Humvee with Hash, both
     wearing sand goggles as they pull up -- Walter salutes.

                         HAVICHON
               Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got
               yourself shot.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Those better be words of sympathy.

     6 ARMY DRIVERS, among them the disillusioned infantrymen
     interviewed by Bill Smithson earlier, get out of their
     vehicles, greeted by Doc, Archie, and Imam.

     Walter walks up, carrying a medical pack.

                         WALTER
               Watcha doing out here, Troy?

     They bang fists in greeting.

                         TROY
               Protecting the free peoples of the
               world, Walter, you know how it is.

                         WALTER
               We better get you fixed up to go
               home to the land of the brave.

     Walter pushes an I.V. needle into Troy's arm.

                         TROY
               Give me that penicillin, baby.

     Doc pushes an I.V. needle into Archie's arm and tapes the
     penicillin sack to Archie's shirt.

                         HAVICHON
               Where ees bullion at, my man?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Bullion ees buried. I'll show you
               after we get these people to the
               border.

                         HAVICHON
               Iranian border?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Part of the deal.

                         HAVICHON
               C'est super, Archie, you got
               yourself a pain in the ass mission
               of mercy.

                         WALTER
               Sorry I fucked up the code, sir.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               It means we gotta move. They might
               be coming for us.

     Bach's "Gloria" plays powerfully.

     Shiites pile into the six open trucks. The lone oil can full
     of gold is loaded, as well. Imam and his daughter are helped
     into a truck by Doc. Archie whistles loud from the front seat
     of the Humvee -- which leads the way as the convoy pulls out.

     Doc, in the back of a truck with Shiites, waves.

     Troy smiles as he sits in the back of a crowded truck with
     Imam, his daughter, and other Shiites.

     HIGH, WIDE CURVING HELICOPTER SHOT

     The six truck convoy, led by the Humvee, rolls across the two-
     lane desert road.

     EXT. BASE CAMP - B COMPANY - DAY

     SIX APACHE CHOPPERS are ROARING on the ground as Captain Van
     Meter, his White Assistant, and General Horn board a chopper.
     Smithson, Paco, and Cathy and her CAMERA MAN rush aboard the
     last chopper in the line.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     The Humvee slows to a halt.

     Archie stands in the front of the Humvee with a rifle at his
     side -- looking straight ahead -- concerned. Troy, Doc, Imam,
     and daughter stare ahead, concerned

     EXT. THE IRANIAN BORDER

     50 yards ahead -- a low wall of razor wire.

     100 yards beyond it, dozens of Iraqi tanks are lined up along
     the border, 100 feet apart, stretching into the distance
     either way. There are 50 IRAQI GROUND TROOPS standing at the
     border station, marked by razor wire on the one-lane road.

     On the far side of the border, IRANIAN SOLDIERS with RELIEF
     WORKERS wearing RED CRESCENTS wait by white school buses and
     stare at the American convoy.

     EXT. IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER

     Archie stares at the border, thinking.

     Imam helps Troy down from the truck. Doc carries the Little
     Girl.

                         HAVICHON
               What are you seenking?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               I see an opening we can walk
               through. But it's not wide enough
               for a truck.

     Archie gets out of the Humvee and looks at the border.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We'll walk them to the border. The
               Iranians will take them. We'll
               walk back to the trucks and get
               out of here.

     Doc turns and signals to the drivers to come up.

     Troy takes the safety off his M-16.

     5 U.S.Drivers get out with their rifles ready. They release
     the safeties. Havichon, with his leg in a cast, stays back to
     man the mounted machine gun on the Humvee. Iraqi soldiers on
     the border nervously watch the Americans and the Shiites,
     holding their machine guns.

     INT. IRAQI TANK - DAY

     POV THROUGH IRAQI GUN SIGHT -- cross hairs pan from Doc, to
     Troy, to Imam, to Archie.

     EXT. BORDER

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Make a close group.

                         IMAM
                      (translates)
               Jihad yamat -- yamat.

     105 Shiites empty the trucks and gather in a crowd that walks
     toward the border. Two Shiite men carry Vig's body, wrapped
     in Arabic cloths.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, lead the crowd single file through a
     narrow opening in the razor wire. On the other side, the
     crowd spreads out and keeps walking. Archie, Troy, and Doc
     walk three abreast, 7 feet apart, rifles ready.

     Imam and Walter are behind, flanking them.

     FACES: CLOSE DOLLY - SHIITE Children, Women, Men, as they
     fearfully walk toward the border. The five U.S. Drivers flank
     the Shiites on either side, rifles ready.

     PAN TO - Troy suddenly drops to one knee.

                         DOC
               Let the air out.

                         TROY
               It's not the air, I don't know
               what it is --

                         DOC
               Stay back.

                         TROY
               I'm all right. I'm just dizzy or
               something --

     EXT. IRAN SIDE OF THE BORDER

     Iranian soldiers and relief workers stand watching.

     PAN AROUND TO - IRANIAN SIDE POV

     The backs of the Iraqi troops and tanks, and the approaching
     Shiites and Americans, walking in the distance.

     EXT. IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER

     Archie helps Troy as they walk three abreast with Doc.

     CHOPPERS ARE HEARD in the distance. They grow LOUDER. Imam
     turns and looks back. Archie turns around and looks.

     SIX APACHE CHOPPERS approach from the distance

     CLOSE DOLLY Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Double time.

     He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy
     cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others.
     The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and
     Walter look up also. Archie does not.

     Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the
     choppers as they pass overhead, loud.

     PAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in
     the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his
     path, blowing up dust.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the
     blowing sand.

     10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers,
     followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles.

     Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively.

     M.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from
     the Shiites.

     Troy shouts over the choppers.

                         TROY
               Wait.

     U.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border.

     The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward
     the border unaccompanied by American protection.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Let them get over the border.

     Troy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest.

                         TROY
               Let them get over, wait --

     Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back.

                         TROY
               I have to reach this --

     Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front --

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Put his cuffs in front.

     He and Doc are pulled away from Troy.

     Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them,
     throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at
     this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is
     thrown to the ground and dragged.

                         TROY
               Look what's happening.

     He collapses to one knee.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               Not our mission, Barlow.

     Troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs
     prevent him from releasing his valve. Troy struggles.

                         TROY
               Cut my cuffs --

     Captain Van Meter leans down to Troy. He shouts over the
     choppers.

                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
               You fucked me and you're fucked
               now, so shut your goddamn mouth.

     Shiites are lined up in a firing squad.

                         DOC
               He's gonna die.

     Troy lies on the ground suffocating. Archie drags the MP
     holding him as he goes to General Horn.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical
               attention, don't let him die --


                         GENERAL HORN
               We are not involved in the Shiite
               problem, do you understand
               me? You are AWOL, you are a
               fugitive, you are under arrest.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Cut his cuffs.

     General Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground,
     concerned.

     A US SOLDIER stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in
     his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade,
     crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing
     by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with
     difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes.

     Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border.

     Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's
     body is dropped in the sand.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We got the gold.

                         GENERAL HORN
               What?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               We got the Kuwaiti bullion.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Bullshit.

     Archie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward
     the lead truck -- where MPs grab and wrestle him down.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               Pull that barrel.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Pull it.

     An MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold
     bars spill to the sand.

     The General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody,
     watch.  The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers --
     and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET.

     THE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in
     custody -- stand and watch Archie.

                         GENERAL HORN
               How much do you have?

                         ARCHIE GATES
               4 tons.

     General Horn picks up a gold brick.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Where's it at?

                         TROY
               Get them over first.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               They helped us get it, Ron. I made
               a deal, and that's soldier's
               honor. You can't fuck them now.

     General Horn looks at Archie.

                         ARCHIE GATES
               You can return this gold, be a big
               hero, get another star maybe.

     Everyone stares at General Horn. After a pause, the General
     fires his pistol into the air.

     Iraqi soldiers freeze as they are about to fire on the
     Shiites.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Let's go, Doug.

     Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk 40 yards to the
     frozen Iraqi soldiers and the terrified Shiites.

     Archie, Troy, Doc in handcuffs with MPS, watch.

     Walter and the other U.S. Soldiers watch from afar as
     Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk into the midst of
     Iraqi soldiers.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Who's in charge here?

     An OLDER IRAQI GENERAL steps forward and salutes.

                         GENERAL HORN
               We have to talk about this
               situation.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, U.S. soldiers watch from a distance.

     ARCHIE'S POV FROM AFAR

     General Horn talks to the Iraqi general.

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     U.S. Soldiers watch.

     TROY'S POV FROM AFAR

     General Horn and Captain Van Meter walk back toward them.

     It is QUIET. No one says anything.

     Pan across Paco taping.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               In a morbid tableau these men have
               recovered some of the gold bullion
               stolen from Kuwait --

                         CATHY DAITCH
               --in violation of American policy,
               saved over a hundred Shiite
               refugees while recovering stolen
               Kuwaiti gold --

                         GENERAL HORN
               Turn that damn camera off.

     He walks up and forcibly pushes the camera to the ground, Van
     Meter pushes Cathy's camera down.

                         BILL SMITHSON
               That's a 75 thousand dollar
               camera --

                         GENERAL HORN
               What the fuck are they doing here?

                         SARGEANT
               I thought they were authorized --

                         GENERAL HORN
               They are not fucking authorized,
               for Christ's sake --

     MPs take the tapes from the cameras.

                         GENERAL HORN
               Haven't I taken care of you,
               dammit?

     He signals the choppers to start up.

     THE CHOPPER ENGINES SLOWLY WHINE into gear.

                         CATHY DAITCH
               I'm gonna get that tape back.

     General Horn walks over to Troy, Archie, and Doc.

                         GENERAL HORN
               You are under arrest. You are
               going to be court-martialed. And
               you will show us where the bullion
               is right now.

     He walks into a chopper, which is now revving at full speed.

     PAN TO Troy, Archie, Doc turn to the border and watch.
     Walter, the handcuffed Drivers, the MPS and other U.S.
     Soldiers also watch.

     The Shiites are released by the Iraqis. They collect
     themselves and gather in a group. The group walks over the
     border and is received by the relief workers.

     Troy, Archie, Doc watch. A U.S. Soldier WHISTLES through the
     loud choppers.

                         SOLDIER #10
               Yeah.

     Then another Soldier joins in, WHISTLING and CLAPPING.

     Then another soldier, until all twenty U.S.
     Soldiers and MPs present are whistling and cheering Troy,
     Archie, and Doc as they stand there while the choppers throb.

     50 yards away: Imam holds his daughter, on the Iran side,
     about to get into a Red Crescent bus.

     Imam and his daughter wave.

     Archie raises his handcuffed wrists to wave back; Troy and
     Doc follow, raising their cuffed hands to wave.

     Freeze frame.

     Troy Barlow runs his own carpet company in Torrance, Cal.

     INT. TROY'S CARPET COMPANY - (MOS)

     "I Get Around" CONTINUES. Troy excitedly gives instructions
     to workers carrying out big rolls of carpet. He wears a short
     sleeved white shirt and a dark tie. His wife gives his two
     year old daughter to him as she holds a new baby and Troy
     uses a respiratory inhaler.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY
     
     From a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle
     of a huge, empty desert.  Just the Humvee, nothing else for
     miles.  We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like
     noises.
     
                          JAEGER (V.O.)
                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     CU - HUMVEE
     
     There are three soldiers at the Humvee.  Second Lieutenant
     JOHN EPPS,                   who sweeps the horizon with a
     pair of binoculars.  PFC WES HAMMOND, who is behind the wheel
     looking very bored, and PFC MARK JAEGER, who is at the
     Humvee's thirty caliber machine gun, making the noises and
     shooting at phantom troops.  When Jaeger talks it's with all
     the swagger of a B-movie hero.

                          JAEGER
                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

                          EPPS
                What are you doing?

                          JAEGER 
                What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm 
                killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- 
                at-at-- 

                          WES 
                Could you stop, please.  You're giving me
                a headache. 

                          JAEGER
                A headache? 

                          WES 
                Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're
                making me uncomfortable. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking 
                away in a desert in the middle of nowhere
                facing three-hundred-thousand screaming 
                Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that
                doesn't bother you.  But me making a 
                little noise is driving you out of your
                skull. 

                          WES 
                Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes. 

                          JAEGER
                Okay. 

     Jaeger goes right back to playing soldier. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                At-at-at-at-at. 

                          EPPS
                Knock it off! 

                          JAEGER 
                Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I 
                want to be ready when this war starts.

                          EPPS 
                Ready for what?  What are you supposed to
                be doing? 

                          JAEGER
                I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. 

                          EPPS
                No you're not. 

     Epps points in the opposite direction that Jaeger was 
     'firing.'

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                The Iraqis are that way.  Those are our
                troops you're shooting at. 

     With his binoculars Epps looks in the direction Jaeger was
     shooting. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You know what?  I think you got 
                Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the 
                General right in the ass.  Now that's
                good shooting. 

                          JAEGER
                Blow me. 

                          EPPS 
                Another month in this desert and I might
                just. 

                          WES 
                Think we're going to do it?  Think we're
                going to war? 

                          EPPS 
                Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All
                they have to do is get out of Kuwait. 

                          JAEGER 
                We ought to kick their asses anyway.
                Even if they do get out of Kuwait we
                ought to kick their asses. 

                          WES 
                I don't think we'll go to war.  We 
                shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our
                fight, it's a regional conflict.  It
                should be decided regionally. 

                          JAEGER 
                People are suffering. 

                          WES
                People were suffering in Afganistan, and
                we didn't do anything.

                          EPPS 
                That's 'cause the Afganis weren't smart
                enough to be sitting on top of oil. 
                People suffering is one thing, but when
                the Yuppies aren't going to have enough 
                gas for their BMWs it's time to break out
                the tanks.  Come on.  Pack up.  We've got
                a whole lot of nothing to patrol. 

     As they pack up and get ready to roll on Jaeger says almost
     to himself:

                          JAEGER 
                We ought to kick their asses.  Either way
                we ought to.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET BAZAAR - EVENING 

     The bazaar is loud and colorful, a cacophony of Arabic fills 
     the air.  The bazaar is filled with vendors actively selling
     their wares to each passerby, literally shoving them in the
     faces of prospective customers. 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger walk along side by side looking almost
     like the Three Musketeers, except that Wes is droning on. 

                          WES 
                ...And it's very important when you sit
                down never to point the soles of your
                shoes at anyone.  It's considered
                offensive. 

                          EPPS 
                You know so much about the Middle East,
                you know where we can get something to
                eat. 

                          JAEGER 
                When do you ever point the soles of your
                feet at people? 

                          WES 
                I'm saying don't do it accidently. 

                          JAEGER 
                Oh yeah.  Accidently. 

     Jaeger lifts his leg and purposefully points the bottom of
     his foot at a vendor. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I'm sorry.  My foot accidently jumped up 
                in the air where you could see the bottom
                of it.  I hate it when that happens.

     (Wes slaps Jaeger's leg down.) 

                          WES 
                Come on.  You're going to get us in
                trouble. 

                          JAEGER 
                It was an accident.  You saw it was an
                accident. 

                          WES 
                I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It
                doesn't hurt to know something about
                Saudi Arabia.

                          EPPS 
                Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn
                Arabic you might as well learn were we
                can get something to eat around here. 

                          WES 
                I didn't learn Arabic because we were 
                getting shipped here.  You don't learn it
                in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in
                high school. 

                          JAEGER
                Spanish wasn't hard enough? 

                          WES 
                I thought it would be good to know. 

                          JAGER 
                Yeah, if you ever need to buy a rug. 

                          WES 
                Hey, Jaeger.  Why don't you try this:
                Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib.

                          JAEGER 
                What does that mean? 

                          WES 
                Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can
                use that when you surrender.

                          JAEGER 
                How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm
                horny."  I can use that now. 

                          WES 
                Don't even try it.  You offend a woman
                out here you're in serious trouble.

                          EPPS 
                Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his
                personality as a form of birth control. 

                          JAEGER 
                Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys
                recently?  Blow me. 

     As Epps and Wes walk on Jaeger notices something on a 
     VENDOR'S table.  It is a small, square box - slightly larger
     than a man's palm - fashioned of wood and metal.  It is not
     particularly ornate, but eye catching in its own way.  The
     instant Jaeger picks it up and begins to look it over the
     Vendor is giving him the hard sell in Arabic.  Jaeger holds
     the box up to the vendor. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                What is this? 

     All he gets is more Arabic.  Jaeger calls over to Wes. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Hey, Wes.  Wes! 

     Wes comes back over to Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                What is this? 

                          WES 
                Now you need me.

                          JAEGER 
                What is it?  You know so much about
                Arabland tell me what it is. 

     Wes looks over the box carefully. 

                          WES 
                Well, based on my knowledge of the 
                region, its culture and her people I
                would have to say it's a box. 

                          EPPS 
                Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I
                really don't care what it is. 

                          JAEGER 
                Ask him what it is.

     Wes says something to the vendor in Arabic.  The Vendor
     answers back. 

                          WES 
                He says it's a box. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, you're funny. 

                          WES 
                It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out
                how to open it there's supposed to be a
                treasure inside.

                          JAEGER
                     (Excited)
                For real?  A treasure? 

                          EPPS 
                Oh, man, you're not going to fall for
                that. 

                          JAEGER 
                There might be something in there. 

                          EPPS 
                Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge. 

                          JAEGER
                There might be. 

                          WES 
                And you're the guy who's going to open 
                it.

                          JAEGER
                I could. 

                          EPPS 
                You could turn on a light if someone put 
                your hand on the switch. 

     Decisively, without even haggling about price, Jaeger whips
     out some money and pays the vendor for the box.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Well, that showed me.  Now, can we eat? 

     The three men walk on, Jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 

     It's filled with young soldiers messing around, playing 
     cards, listening to music, whatever.  Jaeger lays on a bunk
     holding the puzzle box, probing it with his fingers, trying
     to find a way to make it open. 

     Wes crosses over. 

                          WES 
                You get it yet? 

                          JAEGER 
                Naw, nothing. 

                          WES 
                You will.  You'll get it. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I
                get this thing open. 

                          WES 
                You really think there's a treasure
                inside? 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't care if there's a lump of coal in
                here.  I just want to be able to rub 
                Epps' face in it when I crack this thing. 

     Wes watches Jaeger work the box for a beat.

                          WES
                Jaeger? 

                          JAEGER
                What? 

                          WES 
                You know the fifteenth is the deadline
                for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  So? 

                          WES 
                That's in two days.

                          JAEGER
                Like I said; so?

                          WES 
                They're cancelling all leaves, all 
                passes.  No more drills.  We stand at
                full ready starting-- 

                          JAEGER 
                What's your point, Wes?  You have a
                point? 

                          WES 
                We're going to war, aren't we.  If 
                they're doing all that it must mean we're
                going to war. 

                          JAEGER 
                It doesn't mean anything. 

                          WES 
                Why would they do all that if we weren't? 

     Jaeger, frustrated, finally looks up from his box. 

                          JAEGER 
                Okay, so we're going to war.  We're 
                supposed to go to war.  We're soldiers, 
                that's what we do.  The guns, the tanks,
                the planes; you're just now getting the
                hint we're in the war business? 

     Jaeger goes back to his box.  Wes stands over him for a beat
     longer, then: 

                          WES
                Jaeger? 

                          JAEGER 
                     (For sure aggravated)
                What!?

                          WES 
                You ever think about dying? 

                          JAEGER 
                Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open. 

                          WES 
                You ever think about it?  You ever worry? 

                          JAEGER 
                The only thing I worry about is how much
                Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick
                before this whole thing is over.  The 
                only people who I've got anything to worry
                about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys 
                who don't know enough to get out of the 
                way when I come rolling at them; an M-16
                in each hand, and a grenade between my 
                teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier,
                I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got
                a treasure to find. 

     Wes lingers over Jaeger for a few more beats, then walks off as we:

     From a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle
     of a huge, empty desert.  Just the Humvee, nothing else for
     miles.  We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like
     noises. 

                          JAEGER(V.O.)

     It's like the opening scene all over again.  Jaeger is at the
     machine gun, Epps sweeps the horizon with his binoculars, and
     Wes is behind the wheel.  Only difference is that Wes watches
     CNN footage of the air war on a Watchman. 

                          JAEGER
                At-at-at-at-at. 

                          WES 
                     (Re:  His TV) 
                This is so weird.  It's happening, but 
                it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're
                part of it.

                You're going to annoy the Iraqis into
                submission. 

     Jaeger gets down from the machine gun, pulls out his puzzle
     box and starts to work on it again. 

                          JAEGER 
                This is stupid.  It's going on a month 
                now.  How long are they going to let the
                Air Force piss on those bastards?  They 
                can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't
                going anywhere without a ground assault.
                What the hell is the army waiting for? 

                          EPPS 
                Why you in such a hurry to get to

                I've got to have something to tell people
                when I get home besides I protected a 
                stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for
                nothing in the first place. 

                          WES 
                The longer the air force hits the Iraqis,
                the safer it'II be for us when we have to
                engage. 

                          JAEGER 
                You know what, Wes?  If you get a note
                from your mommy they might excuse you
                from the war. 

                          EPPS 
                You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope
                the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my

     Startled, Epps and Wes each pull their guns and spin in 
     Jaeger's direction expecting to have to fire at something. 

                          EPPS
                What!?  What!? 

                          JAEGER 
                I did it!  I got the box open. 

     Jaeger has indeed opened the box.  We can see something
     inside of it. 

                          EPPS 
                You almost got yourself shot, that's
                what you did. 

     Wes excitedly goes over to Jaeger. 

                          WES 
                What's inside? 

     Jaeger pulls out a small tube sealed with wax.

                          JAEGER 
                It's...it's...I don't know what it is. 

                          WES 
                It's a container.  Break the seal. 

     Jaeger hesitates a beat, which heightens a bit of suspense.
     All three men can't help but be drawn closer to the container. 

                          EPPS
                Go on, man. 

     Jaeger pokes his finger through the wax and pulls it off the
     tube.  He sticks his finger back into the container and draws
     out a rolled up piece of paper. 

                          WES
                Paper. 

                          EPPS 
                It's a fortune box. 

     Jaeger unrolls it.

                          WES
                What's it say?

                          EPPS 
                Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle
                box factory. 

     We see the paper.  Lines are drawn on it, large, crude 
     figures.  It's hard to make out exactly what it all is
     supposed to represent. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's a drawing, or something.  Some kind
                of art. 

     Epps takes the paper from Jaeger and gives it a once over. 

                          EPPS 
                Looks like something a kid would do. 

     Wes takes the paper and looks it over.

                          WES 
                It's a map, I think that's what it is.

                          EPPS 
                There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the
                buried treasure, and you're a
                millionaire. 

     Jaeger takes back the paper.  All excited like a kid on
     Christmas:

                          JAEGER
                You think? 

                          EPPS 
                Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You
                and the five thousand other suckers who
                bought those boxes.  Let's get out of
                here.  We got sand to protect. 

     Epps and Wes load up and get ready to move out.  Jaeger just
     keeps staring at the map, eyes lit like candles.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. INTELLIGENCE ROOM - LATER 

     The room is filled with maps, recon photos, HUMINT reports.
     They're posted on the walls with various levels of troop 
     strength - allied and Iraqi - indicated.  More data is 
     constantly flowing in, analyzed and processed. 

     Jaeger enters, spots WOODS - a young soldier on intel detail
     - and crosses over to him. 

                          JAEGER
                Woods. 

                          WOODS 
                Hey, Jaeger.  What's up. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of
                Iraqi. 

                          WOODS 
                A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna 
                have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally
                get out of here.  What kind of map you
                need?  Topographical, geographical,
                thermal?

                          JAGER
                I don't know.  A map map. 

                          WOODS
                A map map. 

     Woods pulls out a map and hands it to Jaeger.

                          WOODS(CONT)
                That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq
                is the pink thing. 

                          JAEGER 
                I could use some recon photos too. 

     Woods gives Jaeger a sideways glance.

                          WOODS 
                Planning on going to war all by your lonesome? 

                          JAEGER 
                Just...want to be ready when we do. 

                          WOODS 
                Ready for what?  Sight-seeing? 

                          JAEGER
                The photos. 

     Woods starts to dig for photos. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Some good ones. 

                          WOODS 
                They're all good ones.  Satellites we've
                got can snap a shot of the boil on
                Saddam's ass. 

                          JAEGER 
                Saddam's got a boil on his ass? 

     Woods looks up at Jaeger with an expression that says:
     "What?"

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                I don't know. 

     Woods goes back to looking, pulls some photos and hands them
     to Jaeger.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                Thanks, man.  Appreciate it. 

     Staring at the pictures like they held the secrets of the
     ages Jaeger starts to exit.  Woods mumbles after him: 

                          WOODS 
                Yeah.  You figure out how to win the war
                be sure to let us know. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. BARRACKS - LATER 

     Maps and photos cover Jaeger's bunk the way autumn leaves 
     cover the ground.  He swings between studying the maps, and
     reading from a book titled A History Of The Ottoman Empire.
     Jaeger puts the book down, then slides the drawing from the
     puzzle box up next to one of the recon photos.  He looks at
     the mosaic he's put together, looks at it like it was having
     a dialogue with him.  Dig it:  It is talking.  A voice only
     Jaeger can hear.  Right now it's just a little whisper, but
     the voice is getting louder. 

     A crossing SOLDIER, carrying a football, calls to Jaeger.

                          SOLDIER 
                Come on, Jaeger.  We're playing ball.

     Jaeger fairly jumps as he comes out of his trance. 

                          JAEGER 
                No that's okay.  I'm gonna...I'm doing some...

     The soldier crosses off.  Jaeger goes back to staring at his
     maps, and photos and drawings and books.  "What were you
     saying?"

     As it all keeps talking to him we:

     Once again President Bush delivers an address.

                This evening, as I report to you, the
                military operation known as Desert Storm 
                enters its final phase.  The coalition
                forces that face the tyranny of Saddam 
                Hussein have launched an all out ground 
                offensive...as this last, and most 
                critical part of the campaign begins I 
                ask for your prayers that God may bless
                each and every one of the coalition 
                forces at our side in the Gulf, and that
                He may continue to bless our nation, the
                United States of America.

     EXT. DESSERT - DAY 

     From a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle
     of a huge, empty desert.  Just the Humvee, nothing else for
     miles.  We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like
     noises. 

                          JAEGER(V.O.) 
                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

     CU - HUMVEE 

     It's our three boys again, just like we've seen them before:
     Jaeger at the machine gun, Epps working his binoculars, and
     Wes at the wheel watching his Watchman. 

     Jaeger jumps down from the machine gun pissed as all hell. 

                          JAEGER 
                They finally start the ground war, and
                where are we?  Same place we've been 
                since we got here.  Securing freedom for
                the dirt. 

                          EPPS 
                Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it
                this way:  At least you get to go home
                alive. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'd like to go home alive with a couple
                of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.

                          WES 
                Hey, look at this! 

     Jaeger and Epps come around to Wes' Watchman.  We see CNN
     footage of some Iraqi soldiers - looking very tired, hungry
     and scared - surrendering to a CNN news crew. 

                          WES{CONT) 
                They're surrendering to a news crew.  You
                believe that?

     Jaeger tosses his hands in the air in defeat. 

                          JAEGER 
                That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours
                into the war and it's over. 

                          WES 
                Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What
                kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?

                          EPPS
                A casual one.

                          WES 
                Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be
                home in no time. 

                          EPPS 
                Better grab up some sand to take home to
                your family.

     Jaeger bites at his lip.  He wants to say something, but 
     isn't quite sure how, if he should, if...  Fuck that, Jaeger.
     Just say it. 

                          JAEGER 
                We...we could go home with something
                else. 

                          WES
                What? 

                          JAEGER 
                With...with millions.  Millions of
                dollars. 

                          EPPS 
                What are you talking about?

     Jaeger pulls out the drawing from the puzzle box.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Don't even.  You're not going to show me
                that tired map. 

                          JAEGER
                Wait.  Wait. 

     Jaeger starts to tear at his pockets like he's trying to get
     at a bee.  He pulls out his other maps, recon photos...  The
     guy's a walking atlas.

     Epps looks on in shock at the spectacle. 

                          EPPS 
                I think you've got some issues to deal
                with.  Really, when we get out of here 
                I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you. 

                          JAEGER 
                Just listen to me!  I've been doing some
                reading.  In the Sixteenth century this
                region was invaded by the Turks.  It 
                became part of the Ottoman empire.  When
                the Turks rolled in they raped, they 
                pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who 
                had anything wanted to hide it from these
                bastards.  They buried their treasures,
                drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle 
                boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read
                about it. 

                          EPPS 
                     (Sarcastic) 
                Wellllll, if you read it it must be true.
                Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? 

                          JAEGER 
                Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this
                stuff. 

                          WES 
                The Turks invaded, yeah. I guess people
                would have hidden what they had.  But 
                that doesn't mean what was in that box
                is-- 

     Jager holds up the puzzle box drawing to one of the maps.

                          JAEGER 
                Looks at this!  Look at it!  The drawing
                is a map of this area right here.  You
                can see it.  The geography, the
                landmarks.  It's the same area. 

     Epps grabs the map from Jaeger.

                          EPPS 
                And you know what that area is?  It's
                Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing 
                with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe
                you've read about it. 

                          JAEGER 
                What we're doing is kicking ass.  For 
                God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering
                to news crews.  The war is over.  We've
                just got to keep shooting people 'cause 
                the army spent all this money, and we've
                got to put on a show for the taxpayers. 

                          WES 
                You're not saying what I think you're
                saying.  I can't believe you're even
                thinking it. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf.
                I got recon photos.  There're no troops
                there, no fighting-- 

                          WES 
                You don't know where the Iraqis have 
                moved to.  And our forces haven't even
                engaged the Republican Guard yet, we 
                don't know--

                          JAEGER 
                It's about a hundred miles from where we
                are now.  How long do you think it would
                take us to-- 

                          WES 
                It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred
                miles through three different kinds of 
                terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a
                river.  If the map is even real. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real. 

                          WES 
                So you just want to cross into hostile 
                territory in the middle of a war on a 
                wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him
                it's crazy, Epps. 

     Epps thinks.  He doesn't say nuthin', just thinks.  It's the
     thinking that makes Wes nervous.

                          WES(CONT)
                Epps, tell him. 

     Epps gets a little more thinking in.  Wes sees which way this
     is going. 

                          WES 
                You're out of your minds, you know that?
                Both of you.  You don't even know if 
                there's anything out there.  What the
                hell are you thinking? 

                          EPPS 
                I'm thinking about when this war is over.
                Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got
                tired of being president of GM?  If a
                brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs 
                there aren't too many big money prospects
                around, and I'm not particularly 
                interested in spending the rest of my 
                life fighting the oil companies' wars.
                So I say if maybe there's something out 
                there, what the hell, that's what I say. 

     Wes can't believe what he's hearing.  He pulls out the last
     card he has to play. 

                          WES 
                It's desertion.

     Jaeger sweeps a hand across the great nothingness.

                          JAEGER 
                Deserting what?  What the hell are we
                deserting? 

     Both Jaeger and Epps close on Wes for the hard sell. 

                          EPPS 
                It's war.  People get lost all the time
                in war, cut off--

                          JAEGER 
                We disappear for awhile.  We disappear,
                we came back; nobody knows nothing. 

                          EPPS 
                But we all got to be in for this.  We all
                go, or we do nothing. 

                          WES 
                Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I
                understand, but you're smarter. 

                          JAEGER 
                You know it's real.  You know it's real,
                and you know it's there.  You know it. 

                          WES 
                You're insane if you think you'll find
                anything, and sure insane if you think
                you can get us there and back alive. 

                          EPPS 
                If you say that, then I say you don't 
                know Second Lieutenant Epps very well, do
                you? 

     Wes buries his head in his hands.  He squeezes at it hard 
     like he'd rather make his brains ooze out his ears than say
     what he's going to say. 

                          WES 
                God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I
                don't. 

                          JAEGER
                Yes! 

                          EPPS 
                It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all
                right.

                          JAEGER 
                We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's
                that easy. 

     Jaeger and Epps start to pack up.  To no one in particular,
     and not too convincingly Wes mutters. 

                          WES 
                Yeah.  That easy. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     To strains of Hendrix's Wait Until Tomorrow the Humvee cuts 
     across the desert kicking up plumes of loose sand.  It looks
     more a dune buggy out for a joy ride than a military vehicle. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     I/E. HUMVEE - SIMULTANEOUS 

     Epps drives, Jaeger rides shotgun, relaxed, feet up on the 
     dash.  Wes is in back with a "what the fuck did I get myself
     into look on his face."  The Hendrix comes from a Walkman 
     hooked up to a pair of small speakers.  Basically these guys 
     are just kicking it.  War?  What war?  Our boys are just on a
     beer run.  Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all. 

                          EPPS 
                Now this is war. 

                          JAEGER
                Roger that. 

                          WES 
                We're going to get court martialed, you
                know that. 

                          JAEGER 
                Hell, we'll just buy our way out. 

     Epps picks up a map and gives it a read.  To Jaeger he says:

                          EPPS 
                Hand me the navicom.

     Jaeger hands Epps a piece of electronic hardware no bigger
     than a video box.  It's a navigational computer which can
     pinpoint its location, by satellite, within meters. 
     Basically the ultimate compass.  Epps compares the navicom's
     readout with the map. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Hold on boys and girls...hold on... 

     Epps watches the navicom...watches it... 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land
                of enchantment and riches.

                          WES
                Oh, God. 

                          JAEGER 
                You're such a pussy, you know that?
                How'd you get in the army? 

                          EPPS 
                Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes? 

                          WES
                What? 

                          EPPS 
                I know you think this is crazy, but a 
                couple of hours from now you're going to
                be one rich dude trying to buy up every
                other puzzle box out there. 

                          WES 
                I'd settle for being alive.  Really.
                Alive would be fine. 

                          JAEGER 
                Epps, is that a sand dune. 

                          WES 
                Oh, no. 

                          EPPS 
                Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is. 

                          WES 
                No, please, not again. 

     Epps punches the accelerator and the Humvee jumps forward
     like a horse out of the gate. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. HUMVEE - SIMULTANEOUS 

     The Humvee hits the dune and takes to the air.  As it arcs up
     and over the desert we hear.

                          WES(VO)
                Nooooooooo! 

     As gravity takes hold and brings the Hummer back to earth we:

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. HUMVEE - LATER 

     Epps is still taking it for a joy ride.  Wes is still getting
     sick. 

                          WES(VO) 
                Came on, I'm serious.  Knock it off. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     The Hummer hits yet another dune and takes flight. 

                          WES(VO) 
                This isn't funny, all right?  I mean it. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     I/E. HUMVEE - SIMULTANEOUS 

     The occupants jostle as the Hummer touches down.  Epps and
     Jaeger laugh and high five.  Wes is content just to go on
     looking sick. 

                          JAEGER
                Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you
                figure these people buried? 

                          WES 
                If!  If there's a treasure. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you
                figure it is? 

                          WES 
                I don't know.  It would be small, easy to
                transport and hide.  Gold or jewels.
                Probably gold.

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah!  Gold!  How much? 

                          WES 
                How the hell should I know how much? 

                          EPPS 
                But that's the great thing about Gold.  A
                little goes a long way. 

                          JAEGER 
                You know what I'm doing with my part of 
                the gold? 

                          WES 
                If there's gold.  If!

                          JAEGER 
                You know what I'm doing with my half? 

     Epps turns to Jaeger.  There's just the slightest, slightest
     hint of edge brushed across his tone.

                          EPPS 
                Third.  What you're going to do with your
                third. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going
                to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty-
                three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out
                and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet. 

                          EPPS 
                A car?  You're going to buy a car? 

                          WES 
                This is too much.  You don't even have
                the money and you're wasting it. 

                          JAEGER 
                A car is not just a car where I come 
                from.  I had this friend, had this wicked
                candy apple red Sixty-four and a half
                Mustang-- 

                          EPPS 
                You're getting gold, and you're going to 
                blow it on wheels? 

                          JAEGER 
                What are you going to do with your third? 

                          EPPS
                Invest it. 

                          JAEGER
                Oh, that's fun. 

                          EPPS 
                It's not about being fun.  It's about 
                being smart.  You take that money, you
                take care of it, let it grow, and you 
                don't ever have to do anything again. 
                Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm
                talking about.

                          JAEGER 
                And I'm talking about enjoying myself.

                          EPPS 
                You know, you sound just like a boy who's
                never-- 

                          WES
                What's that? 

     Jaeger and Epps look out the front windshield.  A plume of
     sand rises up from the desert several hundred meters before
     them.  So engrossed in their discussion previously they
     hadn't even noticed until Wes pointed it out. 

     Epps reaches over and kills the tape player.  A loud quiet
     comes with it.  All three men just stare at the plume as it
     drifts closer.  Finally: 

                          EPPS 
                Take the binoculars.

                          JAEGER
                Wh-what do you think--

                          EPPS
                TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!

     Jaeger scrambles up the binoculars, and stares off into the
     distance.  Epps and Wes wait...they wait... 

                          JAEGER 
                Iraqis. 

                          WES
                Oh, God! 

                          JAEGER 
                Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be
                here. 

                          WES
                Oh, Jesus! 

                          JAEGER 
                They're not...I had the pictures.
                They're not supposed to be here! 

                          EPPS 
                Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up! 

                          JAEGER 
                We've got to do something.  We've got to
                turn around.

                          EPPS 
                We can see them, they can see us.  We
                run, they chase.

                          WES
                What are we going to do? 

     Epps thinks.  Thinking's not good enough for Wes.

                          WES(CONT) 
                What are we going to do!? 

                          EPPS 
                We're going to keep driving. 

                          JAEGER
                They'll shoot us! 

                          EPPS 
                We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we
                keep driving they might think we 
                friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know
                we're Americans they might get scared, 
                think we're part of a detachment and keep
                on going. 

                          JAEGER 
                They're not going to-- 

                          EPPS 
                It's the only way.  We drive!

     Epps is right.  Jaeger and Wes know it.  They shut up and 
     ride.  Dig that tension:  Wes sweating, Epps giving the wheel
     a white knuckle grip.  Jaeger reaches down and readies his M-
     16.  When he chambers it, it sounds like thunder cracking. 

     The plume draws closer and closer until it's not just a 
     plume, but two dots.  Then it's two jeep-like vehicles.  Next
     we can even make out the passengers.

     That doesn't do much to relax our boys.

     Us, the Iraqis, we're almost on top of each other now.  The
     vehicles are going to pass within feet.  Epps throws in one
     more thing:

                          EPPS 
                Wave at them.  Don't look, just wave.

     All three throw up some weak, forced waves.  THE VEHICLES
     PASS.  Look at that:  The Iraqis are waving back.  And that's 
     all they're doing, just waving.

     Our boys break out into cheers. 

                          JAEGER
                Yeah!  Yeah! 

                          WES
                I think I'm going to throw up.  I am.
                I'm going to toss. 

                          JAEGER 
                You see that?  Right by us.  They went 
                right by.  You had them Epps; you called
                it. 

                          EPPS 
                Figure they don't want to mess with us 
                anymore than we want to mess with them. 

                          JAEGER 
                Look at you, not even breaking a sweat.
                You're cool, boy.  You're cool. 

     They all have a good laugh, but Wes brings that to a crashing
     halt.  Looking back at the Iraqis, in a voice dead with fear: 

                          WES
                They stopped. 

                          EPPS
                Wha... 

                          WES 
                Oh, Jesus, they've stopped. 

     Epps and Jaeger look behind them.

                          WES(CONT) 
                They stopped, and they've turned around. 

     The two Iraqi vehicles have stopped, they've turned, and now
     they're racing towards our boys.  Epps momentarily freezes.
     Jaeger helps him right out of it. 

                          JAEGER 
                Go, go, go! 

     Epps punches it, and the Hummer takes off.  The Iraqis are
     right behind them. 

     The vehicles all do same hard driving:  They twist and turn
     like wild snakes over the loose sand; hit dunes, take 
     flight... It's the open desert, and our boys have nowhere to
     hide. 

     Inside the Hummer it's a rough, rough ride.  Our boys are
     thrown violently about the cabin.  For Epps controlling the
     Hummer is about as easy as riding a wild horse. 

     The Iraqis turn things up a notch and start sending gunfire
     our way.  Bullets kick up around the Hummer like angry, 
     little bees with a hell of a sting.  Epps yells at Jaeger. 

                          EPPS
                Shoot them! 

     Now it's Jaeger who's freezes.  Epps returns the favor.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Shoot 'em! 

     Jaeger climbs back to the Humvee's machine gun, works the
     action and starts firing.  Unlike before when he was playing,
     the real thing is much wilder.  The Humvee bounces around 
     like a cork in the ocean.  Taking aim is nearly impossible.
     The best Jaeger can do is squeeze off rounds in the Iraqis'
     general direction. 

     All Wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared
     little girl. 

                          JAEGER
                Steady it out! 

                          EPPS 
                I steady it out, they blow us out of the
                sand! 

     It's like a dog fight in the dirt.  The vehicles weave,
     cut... One of the Iraqis starts to cut across Jaeger's firing
     line.  Jaeger swings the machine gun around hard and lets
     loose.  A hail of bullets rips into the Iraqi vehicle just
     above wheel level.  It kicks the vehicle up and back, 
     whipping and twisting it horribly in the air time after time,
     then smashing it back into the ground. 

     Jaeger is beside himself.

                          JAEGER 
                I got him!  You see that, I nailed him! 

     As if in answer the remaining Iraqi vehicle's gunner tears
     off a salvo that eats up the space right around Jaeger.  He's
     not hit, but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming
     with fear. 

                          EPPS
                Damn it!

     The boys are running out of options, and Epps knows it. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Wes, take the wheel. 

     No good. Wes is too scared to move.  Epps reaches back and
     literally pulls him up and over into the front. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Take it! 

     With little finesse Wes takes the wheel as Epps slides over.
     Epps takes up an M-16 with a grenade launcher.  He loads it
     up, and readies the weapon.  Crawling to the back he takes
     aim. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Keep it steady. 

     Wes does his best to give a level ride, but the Iraqi bullets
     coming at them don't help much. 

     Epps zeroes in on the target.  He takes aim and starts to
     squeeze back on the trigger.  He almost has a shot off when
     Wes hits a dune rocking the Hummer violently.  Epps loses the
     target. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Damn it!  I said keep it steady. 

     Epps tries to take aim again.  Careful aim.  One shot is all
     he gets.  The bullets keep coming, but he's in no hurry.
     Waiting...waiting...  The Iraqis are only getting closer. 

                          WES
                Shoot...shoot! 

     Waiting...

     Closer... 

                          WES
                SHOOT! 

     EPPS FIRES!  The grenade rips from the launcher, riding a 
     trail of white smoke, and slams into the Iraqis.  You know 
     the story:  Huge explosion, car parts flying a hundred feet
     into the air, bodies whipping through space, stuff Bob Dole
     would hate.  But maybe he would like it.  They were just
     Iraqis.

     Wes brings the Hummer to a halt.  A spastic, scared, relieved 
     laugh escapes him.  Jaeger, checking himself for wounds, and
     Epps, M-16 still in hand, get out.  Epps makes his way to the
     wreckage, sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any
     survivors.  Yeah, like somebody's walking away from that
     bang. 

     Wes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and
     stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was.

                          WES
                I thought we were dead. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, well, we're not. 

                          WES 
                We got to get out of here. 

     Nobody says anything.  This really scares Wes.

                          WES(CONT)
                We have to go back. 

                          JAEGER 
                We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we
                get what we came for. 

                          WES 
                     (Incredulous) 
                We just about got killed.  You know what
                happened?  We just about got killed, and 
                you want to go on? 

                          EPPS 
                Jaeger, go check out the Hummer for
                damage.

     Jaeger starts to cross back to the Hummer.  Wes gives him
     something to take with him. 

                          WES 
                You're crazy, you know that?  You're
                insane! 

     Jaeger goes leaving Epps and Wes all by their lonesome.  Wes
     turns to Epps.

                          WES(CONT) 
                You know that, right?  You know he's
                sick? 

     With a flip of his head Epps indicates the dead Iraqis.

                          EPPS 
                They shouldn't have been here.

                          WES 
                We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There
                is a war going on! 

                          EPPS 
                This is miles from the battle lines.
                They were probably deserters. 

                          WES 
                Deserters would have run, they wouldn't
                have engaged. 

                          EPPS 
                They shouldn't have been out this way,
                that's all I'm saying. 

     Wes starts to get it.  It really doesn't matter what he has
     to say. 

                          WES 
                We're not going back, are we? 

     Epps has got nothing to say to the truth.  He turns and
     starts to walk to the Hummer.

                          WES(CONT) 
                You bastard!  You're trying to get us
                killed. 

     Like a whip Epps snaps around.  He grabs up Wes and pulls him
     close. 

                          EPPS 
                I'm trying to get us paid.  I'm trying to
                get us all paid!  As long as there's a 
                chance something is out there we go on.
                There's not going to be anymore trouble.
                If there is, we go back, but there won't
                be. 

     Almost as an afterthought Epps realizes he's got Wes, and
     lets him go.  Gently he puts it: 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You'll feel different after we find the
                treasure.  Money has away of making
                people feel different. 

     Nobody's got anytbing to say to that, so they say nothing.
     Epps heads back to the Hummer.  A beat later Wes follows.

     Jaeger is already behind the wheel.  Epps rides shotgun this
     time.  Once again Wes is in back.  To Jaeger, Epps ask: 

                          EPPS
                She okay? 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine. 

                          EPPS
                Let's go.

     Jaeger fires it up, and pulls out.  As they head off we: 

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK

                                                           FADE TO:

     I/E. HUMVEE - LATER 

     The sun beats down violently as the Hummer rolls along.
     Epps, Jaeger and Wes all ride along in an angry silence.
     Jaeger starts to smile.  He chuckles to himself.  Epps, 
     looking for anything to break the tension smiles a bit 
     himself. 

                          EPPS
                What? 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest
                of the boys knew what we're doing.  I
                mean if they knew what we were coming
                back with. 

                          EPPS 
                You can't tell anybody about this. 

                          JAEGER 
                I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they
                knew.  We're going to be millionaires,
                man.  Millionaires! 

     Epps joins in cackling like a Hyena. 

                          EPPS 
                It'd make their heads explode.

                          JAEGER 
                Millionaires, man. 

     He turns back to Wes.

                          JAEGER(CONT} 
                You know we're going to be rich.  Admit
                it.  You know.  Come on, admit it. 

     In spite of himself Wes gives a little smile.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                Ahh, there it is.  There it is.  You know
                it. 

     Singing to Levert: 

                          EPPS 
                Money, money, money, money...MONEY. 

     Jaeger joins in. 

                          EPPS/JAEGER 
                Money, money, money, money...MONEY. 

     Epps starts to slow down. 

                          WES 
                What are you doing.

                          EPPS 
                Low on gas.  Got to refill. 

     A nervous look punches it way onto Jaeger's face.  Epps
     stops.  He and Wes jump out of the Hummer and go around back 
     to the reserve tanks.

     Jaeger stays in the vehicle looking all tense.  After a beat
     Epps screams for him. 

                          EPPS(O.C.)
                Jaeger...JAEGER! 

     Time to face the music.  Jaeger hauls himself out of the 
     Hummer and goes around to Epps who's got a look on his face
     like he's just had a spoonful of steaming shit.  He points
     angrily at one of the reserve tanks. 

                          EPPS 
                Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell.
                It's been leaking gas since the fire 
                fight.  I told you to check for damage. 

                          JAEGER
                ...I know. 

                          EPPS 
                And you missed this?  How are you going
                to miss something like this? 

                          JAEGER 
                I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew 
                one of the reserves got hit you'd want to
                turn back. 

                          WES 
                So, you just let us drive on knowing we 
                were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going
                to run low in the middle of nowhere? 

                          JAEGER 
                ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back. 

     Wes gets a slow boil on. 

                          WES 
                ...You stupid son of a bitch. 

     Wes lunges for Jaeger, but doesn't have the speed or the
     skills.  Jaeger counters, and sinks a fist into Wes' jaw. 
     Wes goes down, but he manages to take Jaeger to the sand with
     him.  They start to scrape, but it's obvious Jaeger has got
     the upper hand.

     Epps reaches down and yanks Jaeger off of Wes.

                          EPPS
                Get off him. 

     Jaeger comes up to his feet.  Wes wipes some blood from his 
     lips.  He looks down at his bloodied hand, then sneers at
     Jaeger. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You two fighting's not going to get us 
                anything.

                          WES 
                Him getting us stranded out here doesn't
                do much good either.

                          JAEGER 
                We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas
                in the other reserve to get us back.

                          WES 
                Then lets go back while we still can.

                          JAEGER 
                As soon as we hit the mountain we would 
                have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not
                that far.  We can make it. 

                          EPPS 
                What do we do with the Humvee?

                          JAEGER
                We leave it. 

                          WES 
                What if someone takes it? 

     Jaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert.

                          JAEGER
                Who?  Who's going to take it.  We mark
                the location with the navicom, we can
                come right back to this spot. 

     Wes has had enough. 

                          WES 
                You two don't even know how crazy you 
                are.  You want to go on your sick, little
                treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me
                absent. 

                          JAEGER 
                You have to go with us, Wes. 

                          WES 
                Really?  What is that, an order, private? 

                          JAEGER 
                You have to go with us.  You can't walk
                back... 

     Jaeger dangles the keys to the Humvee from a finger.

                          JAEGER{CONT) 
                And you sure as hell aren't going to
                drive. 

     Wes burns a hole through Jaeger's head with his eyes.  Epps
     steps to him.

                          EPPS 
                Load what you can; water, tools, weapons.
                Anything you think we might need. 

     Wes burns on a bit more, then turns and heads for the Hummer.
     Jaeger watches him go, then smiles to himself.

                          JAEGER
                Who's he kidding?  He wants it as bad as
                we do.  We're going to be fat, Epps.  As
                soon as we get back to Saudivillie you
                and me are going to-- 

     Epps gets up in Jaeger's face.  The menace he projects is
     very real. 

                          EPPS 
                We're going to keep going 'cause I want
                some of whatever's out there.  But you 
                ever pull something like trying to get my
                ass stranded out here again, and I'll
                kill you myself.  You got that? 

     Jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                SAY IT! 

                          JAEGER
                I got that...sir. 

     Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all
     scared with himself. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     A long line of footprints works their way through the sand up
     to Epps, Jaeger, and Wes.  Epps and Wes trek side by side.

     Jaeger is behind them, having trouble keeping up.  Between
     pants he gasps:

                          JAEGER 
                Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to
                go so fast. 

                          EPPS 
                Faster we get there, faster we get back. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you. 

     Jaeger struggles on just a bit more, then:

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a
                little water. 

                          EPPS 
                Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you
                aren't getting any of ours.

                          JAEGER 
                I'm just going to have a little sip,
                that's all.  Just a sip. 

     Jaeger lets himself drop down into the sand.  He looks up.
     Epps and Wes are still walking. 

                          JAGER{CONT)
                Wait for me! 

                          EPPS
                You can catch up. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah...I'm right behind you. 

     Wes looks back at Jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his
     water. 

                          WES 
                Thanks for straightening out Jaeger.

     Epps shrugs, like hitting Jaeger wasn't much of anything.

                          EPPS 
                Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But
                if we do it, we do it right.  I just
                needed to explain that in a way I
                wouldn't have to do it again. 

                          WES
                Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an
                idiot. 

                          EPPS
                He's not so-- 

                          WES 
                He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as
                hard as he thinks.

                          EPPS 
                How tough you have to be to make the 
                army?  All you've got to do is shoot a
                gun, and stop a bullet.

     Again Epps looks behind him as Jaeger struggles to his feet
     and stumbles after his two comrades.

                          WES 
                Look at him.  We ought to just leave him
                behind. 

     Epps gives a little laugh like he's just heard a mildly
     amusing punchline.

                          WES(CONT) 
                Like he said:  People get lost in wars
                all the time.  And out here?  Out here
                there are eight million ways to die. 

     All this talk starts to creep out Epps a little. 

                          EPPS 
                Okay, so he was riding you.  Get over it.

     Wes smiles a little smile. 

                          WES
                I'm just talking. 

     They walk on.

     Jaeger works to catch up, muttering to himself as he goes.

                          JAEGER
                Can't even slow up for me.  Wasn't for me
                they wouldn't even be here.  I'm the one
                that found the map.  Should have just 
                come by myself.  Should've.  Shouldn't
                even cut them in.  Shouldn't. 

     As Jaeger steps down be hears an audible clicking sound come 
     from under his boot.  He goes dead still.  Panic races up and
     down his spine.  In almost a whisper be says:

                          JAEGER
                Epps... 

     Again, louder: 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Epps! 

     Like he couldn't be more annoyed Epps turns around.

                          EPPS
                What!? 

                          JAEGER
                Mine. 

     Epps isn't sure of what he's heard. 

                          EPPS
                What? 

                          JAEGER
                Mine.  Land mine!

     Epps doesn't say anything, he just keeps on staring.  Scared,
     angry they don't get it: 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I stepped on a land mine!

     Epps and Wes look at each other, then back to Jaeger.  Like
     he's got no time to mess around: 

                          EPPS 
                You didn't step on any mine. 

                          JAEGER
                I heard it click. 

                          EPPS 
                If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by
                now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines
                anymore. 

                          JAEGER
                I heard it.

                          WES 
                Maybe it's just a can, or something. 

     Jaeger loses it. 

                          JAEGER 
                JESUS CHRIST, I'M STANDING ON A MINE.
                SHUT UP, AND GET OVER HERE! 

     Just plain sick of all this, Epps and Wes trudge back over to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS 
                Paranoid, that's your problem.  You're
                just paranoid.  Why'd the paranoid one
                have to find the map? 

     Epps pulls a knife from his belt.  He sinks to the ground and
     probes the sand under Jaeger's foot.  Nothing...nothing... 
     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF METAL AGAINST METAL.  Epps goes white.
     For a second he doesn't move.  Tension falls like a steel
     curtain.  Slow, careful, Epps withdraws the blade and stands.
     Jaeger reads the expression on Epps' face. 

                          JAEGER
                Oh, God!  Oh God! 

                          EPPS
                Just be cool. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's a mine, isn't it? 

                          EPPS
                Just relax. 

                          JAEGER 
                How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!? 

                          EPPS 
                We're going to get off, all right.  We'll
                get you off of there.  Just...be cool. 

     Epps goes to Wes.  The two start to move away from Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER
                Where you going? 

                          EPPS 
                Me and Wes are just going to talk. 

                          JAEGER 
                Why you got to move away to talk!? 

                          EPPS 
                We're going to be right over here. 

                          JAEGER 
                You're moving away because it's going to
                blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow
                up! 

                          EPPS 
                I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool! 

     Epps and Wes move over and huddle.

                          WES 
                What kind of mine? 

                          EPPS 
                I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess
                with it. 

                          WES
                Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse,
                that's Vietnam stuff. 

                          EPPS 
                Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford,
                okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. 
                Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe 
                it's going to go off in two seconds, and
                we won't have to worry about getting 
                Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to
                worry about is finding the pieces. 

     Behind them, pathetically, Jaeger cries: 

                          JAEGER
                Epps... 

                          WES 
                Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be
                able to get him off it anyway. 

                          EPPS
                There's a way. 

                          JAEGER
                Epps...

                          WES 
                Can't do it.  Can't do it, and keep him 
                alive. 

     Epps' eyes narrow.  He doesn't want to hear this kind of
     talk. 

                          EPPS 
                I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.

                          JAEGER 
                Epps, my leg is falling asleep. 

     Epps thinks, and thinks hard.

                          EPPS
                     (To Wes) 
                We've got rope? 

                          WES
                For climbing.

                          EPPS
                Break it out. 

     Epps crosses back over to Jaeger.

                          JAEGER
                My leg is falling asleep. 

                          EPPS
                It's not falling asleep.  You've only
                been standing there for three minutes. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's
                falling asleep. 

                          EPPS 
                It falls asleep and you die, so wake it
                the hell up. 

     Wes crosses over with climbing rope.  Very, very gently Epps
     wraps the middle of the rope around Jaeger's waist leaving
     several feet dangling off each end. 

                          JAEGER 
                How's this going to work? 

                          EPPS 
                Me and Wes each going take an end of the 
                rope, run our asses of, and yank you off
                the mine. 

                          JAEGER 
                That's going to do it, right?  I'm going
                to be okay.

     Not too convincingly: 

                          EPPS
                You're going to be fine. 

                          JAEGER
                You're not going to let me die, are you!?
                Don't let me die! 

     Ignoring the question:

                          EPPS 
                When we start running suck up your 
                breath.  You're going to get the wind
                knocked out of you. 

                          JAEGER 
                Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to
                die. 

     Epps and Wes pick up separate ends of the rope, and take up 
     positions behind Jaeger.  Epps waits a beat, afraid of what
     might happen, but there is no choice.  He digs in ready to
     take off running.  Wes whispers to him:

                          WES 
                What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to
                bounce right up out of the ground, 
                explode in the air, kill him and us. 

                          EPPS
                You just go when I say go. 

                          WES 
                Should have at least gotten the map off
                of him.  Blows up with him then we did
                all this for nothing. 

     Ignoring him: 

                          EPPS
                Ready? 

                          WES
                Yeah. 

     Epps takes a couple of deep breaths, holds one: 

                          EPPS
                GO! 

     Wes and Epps are off the the races, churning up sand as they
     race away from Jaeger.  They scream like banshees as if to
     draw strength.

     Jaeger does a little chant: 

                          JAEGER 
                Oh, God.  Oh, God! 

     The rope goes taught.  Jaeger's body jerks violently backward
     as he gets the air punched out of him.  As his feet leave the
     ground the mine detonates.

                                                            CUT TO:

     POV - JAEGER 

     A fireball blossoms, and eats up the air towards the camera
     as THE CAMERA ITSELF RUSHES AWAY from the belching fire and
     smoke. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     JAEGER 

     His feet just clear the outer edge of the fireball, but still
     get licked and burned by flames before he slams to the ground
     several feet from the explosion. 

     Epps runs to Jaeger.  Wes takes a casual stroll back over. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm all right.  Oh, Jesus, I'm all right. 

     All casual like, Wes says: 

                          WES
                The map okay? 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     We see a set of three very odd tracks across the ground.  It
     looks like something has been dragged through the sand.  THE
     CAMERA FOLLOWS THE TRACKS TO EPPS, WES AND JAEGER who crawl
     on their bellies.  They thrust knifes into the sand before 
     them searching for mines.  We get the feeling they've been at
     this for awhile.

                          WES
                How long we going to keep this up. 

                          JAEGER 
                Until we're out of the mine field is how
                long. 

                          WES 
                Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.

                          JAEGER 
                That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could 
                have just spread them out like that; make
                us think we're in the clear. 

                          WES 
                You want to crawl, crawl. 

     Wes stands and starts to walk.  Epps waits a beat and follows
     suit.  Only Jaeger stays down. 

                          JAEGER 
                You're going to blow yourselves up. 

                          EPPS 
                Wes is right.  If there were any more 
                mines we would have found them.  Hell, 
                that one you stepped on was probably old 
                anyway; left over from the war with Iran.

                          JAEGER 
                You don't know that.  It could be a trick. 

                          EPPS 
                If we step on a mine we'll know it was.
                Let me see the maps.

     Jaeger stays down, afraid to get up. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Get up and give me the maps.

     After a beat Jaeger stands and hands over the map from the
     puzzle box and a recon photo.  Epps compares the two, then
     takes out the navicom. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                We're on course.  Northeast, twenty-eight
                degrees.  When we hit the base of the 
                mountain we'll find a pass.  I can see it
                on the recon photo.  Shouldn't be too 
                hard to traverse.  That'll take us to the
                top and... 

     Epps points at a black dot on the puzzle box map with a
     smaller white dot in the middle. 

                          EPPS 
                This.  Whatever it is. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's the treasure, that's what it is. 

                          WES
                It better be. 

     Epps starts to pack away the map.  Real plain Jaeger says:

                          JAEGER
                The map. 

     Epps stops, like he almost not sure what Jaeger is talking
     about.  Jaeger extends a hand. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                The map. 

     Epps gets it.  He hands the map back to Jaeger who tucks it
     away.  Our boys walk on. 

                          EPPS 
                You're not losing trust, are you? 

                          JAEGER
                Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang
                on to it. 

                          WES 
                If all we wanted was the map out of you
                we could have taken it while you were
                standing on that mine pissing on
                yourself. 

                          JAEGER 
                Probably would've too if Epps wasn't
                around to stop you. 

                          EPPS 
                I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause 
                nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in
                this together, understand? 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to
                come along in the first place, but he 
                gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet
                deal. 

                          WES 
                I'm getting tired of you riding me,
                Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 
                Anytime you want to do something about it
                just let-- 

     Epps stops dead in his tracks.

                          EPPS
                Quiet! 

     They all go quiet. Epps cocks an ear to the air and listens.
     They all listen.  Wind, but that's about it. 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't hear any-- 

                          EPPS 
                Shut up and listen!

     Again they listen.  Again they hear wind.  Then, there it is;
     the sound Epps is looking for:  A pop, like a big balloon
     being burst just over the next rise. 

                          WES
                Gunfire. 

     Quick like that Jaeger grabs his M-16 down off his shoulder
     and is about to ready it when Epps slaps down the muzzle.

                          EPPS
                Don't! 

                          JAEGER 
                It's a fire fight. 

                          EPPS 
                Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight.
                That's not a battle going on. 

                          WES
                What is it? 

     Epps thinks.  Yeah, what the hell is it? 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - RISE 

     Epps, Jaeger, and Wes edge carefully up to the lip of the 
     rise on their bellies.  They're barely visible against the
     sand.  Epps takes out a pair of binoculars and zeros in on
     the ground below. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     POV - EPPS 

     THROUGH BINOCULAR LENSES we see a SHI'ITE CAMP:  A tent city 
     really.  There are several uniformed IRAQI SOLDIERS who are
     roughing up the Shi'ite men.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS, WES, JAEGER 

                          JAEGER 
                What is it? 

     Epps hands the binoculars over to Jaeger.  Who looks down at
     the scene on the ground.

                          EPPS 
                Iraqis.  A bunch of them. 

                          JAEGER 
                What are they doing here? 

     Jaeger hands the binoculars to Wes.

                          EPPS 
                Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm
                guessing that has something to do with
                them being here.

                          JAEGER 
                What are they doing in the middle of
                nowhere? 

                          WES 
                Maybe they're looking for gold. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     POV - WES 

     AGAIN WE SEE THROUGH THE BINOCULAR LENSES.  One of the Iraqi
     soldiers is pushing around a Shi'ite, having a good laugh 
     about it, then casual as rain pulls out a gun and gives him a
     bullet, gift wrapped, straight to the brain. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS, WES, JAEGER

                          JAEGER 
                Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for?
                They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing
                Iraqis? 

                          WES 
                Those people down there are Shi'ites.
                You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq
                and Khurds in the North.  Neither of
                them've got much love for Saddam. 
                Probably figured once the war started 
                there might be an uprising, so he sent
                his soldiers out to slap them around some. 

                          EPPS 
                They're doing more than slapping.

                          JAEGER 
                The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't
                know that. 

                          WES 
                Is there anything you do know? 

                          JAEGER 
                I know you're a pussy.  I know that. 

                          EPPS 
                All right.  Let's get out of here. 

                          WES 
                The soldiers are going to kill those
                people! 

                          JAEGER
                So? 

                          WES
                We have to do something. 

                          EPPS
                There's nothing we can do.

                          WES 
                We can fight.  That's what we're here 
                for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the
                Shi'ites, and the Khurds. 

                          JAGER 
                I didn't sign up to help any Shi'ites.
                All we were supposed to do is get the 
                Iraqis out of Kuwait, and if we aren't
                doing that then all bets are off. 

                          EPPS 
                We carrying any ordinance? 

                          WES 
                Some extra grenades.  A Claymore. 

     Epps thinks, then shakes his head.

                          EPPS 
                Not enough.  We're out numbered and out
                gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.

                          JAEGER 
                So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for 
                playing.  We have some lovely parting
                gifts for you as you go. 

                          WES 
                We're American soldiers.  We don't
                abandon people. 

                          JAEGER 
                Funny you should say that while we're out
                looking for gold. 

                          WES 
                You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so
                bad. 

                          JAEGER 
                I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich.
                The only way the Iraqis figure into that
                is not at all. 

                          EPPS
                     (To Wes) 
                I don't want to see people killed any 
                more than you.  But we try to help out we
                die, and all we do is die. 

                          WES 
                We can't just go off and-- 

                          EPPS 
                There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't
                even be here in the first place. 

     There's a big, loud quiet as our boys just hang there.  From
     down below comes another balloon burst; another gun shot.

     Epps lowers his head.  He wants to fight, but it's like he 
     said:  There's nothing they can do.  Epps slides back away 
     from the rise, then Jaeger, and finally Wes disappears back
     the way they came.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT/MOUNTAINS - LATER 

     It's the kind of red rock and mesas one would expect to find 
     in a desert; not too steep or rough, but it looks as though
     they will definitely takes more than a little physical
     exertion to navigate. 

     Epps, Wes, and Jaeger approach a path at the mesa's base.
     Jaeger takes out his maps and looks them over.

                          JAEGER 
                This is it.  We're right on target. 

     Epps takes a long gander up towards the top of the mesa.

                          EPPS 
                All we've got to do is make it to the
                top.

                          WES 
                And find the treasure, and get it, and 
                get back to the Humvee, and get the hell
                out of Iraqi without getting our heads
                blown off, but that's about it. 

                          EPPS 
                We're not going to find anything standing
                here.  Let's get to climbing. 

     They ready their packs and weapons, then start up the mesa.

                                                           FADE TO:

     Our boys trekking along the pass.  They push onward and
     upward.

                                                           FADE TO:

     The pass has narrowed, and become more treacherous:  The
     rocks are loose and the footing unsure.  The going has slowed
     considerably as each man must be extremely careful of their
     steps.

                                                           FADE TO: 

     Our boys stop.  The pass has seemingly came to an end.  For a
     short ways the face of the mesa is almost sheer.  The three
     soldiers take it in. 

                          EPPS 
                Not much of a pass.

                          WES 
                Probably was a couple of hundred years
                ago when whoever drew the map came 
                through here.  Worn down to nothing now.

                          EPPS 
                Picks up again just on the other side. 

     They all take a good look at what little there is to cross 
     on, and how far down it is to the hard, jagged rocks below. 

                          JAEGER 
                Think we can make it? 

                          WES 
                We make it, or we go back empty handed.

                          EPPS 
                Looks like we make it. 

     Epps and Wes edge their way towards what's left of the pass.
     Jaeger just stands there staring down.  Way down.

                                                           FADE TO: 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of
     the mesa.  Small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to
     the ground below.  No man says a word, they're too busy 
     trying to keep alive, and the air is filled with the sounds
     of labored breathing.

     Each step so very careful:  Testing the pass for purchase,
     making sure the footing is solid.  They inch one foot
     forward, then slide over the next.  Their hands probe the
     cliff face, fingers crawling like spider legs, looking for
     something, anything, to take hold of. 

     Sweat drips into Epps eye.  He blinks hard and fast trying to
     clear his vision.  Right now he can't really afford
     distractions. 

     Slowly, carefully, inch by inch the little death dance goes
     on. 

     Jaeger steps.  He steps wrong.  The pass gives way under his 
     foot and begins to slide down.  Instinctively Wes rockets out
     an arm grabbing Jaeger by the uniform.  At first Jaeger 
     smiles, glad for the save.  But then he realizes something: 
     Wes is literally holding his life in his hands.  All Wes has
     to do is loosen his grip, and...

     The color drains from Jaeger's face.  Wes stares back blank
     as a bowl of water. 

     Eternity goes on for a second. 

     Finally Wes yanks Jaeger back up against the mesa's face,
     then slides on.  Jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat
     clutching the rocks for dear life.

                                                           FADE TO:

     Epps makes it to the far side of the broken pass.  He holds
     out a hand to Wes and reels him in.  Together they both help
     bring in Jaeger.  Wes looks back over the path they've just
     crossed. 

                          WES 
                The US Army:  Always an adventure.

                          EPPS 
                Let me see the map.

     Jaeger hands the map to Epps who gives it a going over.  THEY
     WALK AS THEY TALK.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Should be easy going from here.  Stay on
                the pass straight to the dot. 

                          WES 
                What do you figure it to be? 

                          EPPS 
                Got to be some kind of landmark;
                something distinctive.

                          JAEGER
                X marks the spot.

                          EPPS 
                Something like that.

                          JAEGER 
                But the white dot in the middle; that's
                got to mean something.

                          EPPS 
                I hope it means something, otherwise...

                          WES 
                Otherwise whatever we're looking for
                could be anywhere.

                          EPPS 
                Basically.  But the map has been pretty
                precise so far.  I don't think it'll be
                too hard to-- 

     Our boys step past a grouping of rocks.  They stop dead.
     Sitting before them, in what looks like a small camp, is FIVE
     IRAQI SOLDIERS.  Time clicks by real slow for an instant.
     It's a delayed reaction, like the beat it takes after you
     pick up a hot pan before you realize that, yeah, it is
     burning the flesh from your hand. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Take cover! 

     Our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came.
     They run like wild rabbits for a bit, jumping over a rock
     formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover. 
     Like well-trained warriors they peel their weapons from their
     shoulders, lock and load, and stand ready.  They wait a bit,
     taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under.
     Finally Epps gives the order. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Let's hit 'em! 

     Simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear
     down on the Iraqis with their M-16s ready to blow them to
     kingdom come. 

     One problem:  No Iraqis.

     For a beat our three don't move.  They hold position, breath
     coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race.  They're 
     eyes flint back and forth scanning for something...anything.
     There's nothing. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Cover me. 

     M-16 still at the ready, Epps raises up taking a tactical
     stance.  He inches forward, sweeping his weapon back and 
     forth before him for any potential target.  There is none.
     The Iraqis have vanished.  Epps lowers the M-16, but does not
     shoulder it. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Clear. 

     Wes and Jaeger come up from their cover and cross to Epps.
     They keep their weapons ready.  Eerily they all look around
     as if trying to spot ghosts.

                          WES 
                Where'd they go? 

                          EPPS 
                I don't know.  There's a lot of space up
                here.  They could be just about-- 

                          WES 
                Weird they didn't chase us.

                          JAEGER 
                Maybe they're as scared of us as we are
                of them. 

                          WES 
                Just seems weird they didn't chase us.

                          EPPS 
                What's weird is how they disappeared. 
                Doesn't make sense.  Doesn't...

     There is a sound; a steady swooshing that starts faint and 
     grows closer like a rolling thunder.  Our three start looking
     around, turning where they stand, trying to find the source
     of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch.  There's
     nothing.  They see nothing.  Still the sound races closer and
     closer.  Epps, Jaeger and Wes raise up their weapons in
     preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast.

     From below the edge of the mesa a HELICOPTER GUNSHIP -
     probably a MIL MI-24 HIND-D ARMED ASSAULT HELICOPTER if you
     want to be technical - raises up very dramatically into
     sight.  It hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers.
     On board are the vanished Iraqis wearing nasty grins.  The
     PILOT brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine
     cannons at our boys.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Scatter! 

     Wes and Jaeger don't have to be told twice.  They bolt from
     their spots, and not an instant too soon.  The GUNNER lets
     fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground
     where our boys were just standing.  We see what the chopter's 
     weapons will do to rock.  We can imagine what they would do
     to flesh. 

     Epps, Jaeger and Wes take cover behind some rocks.  The 
     gunship swings around, picks up speed and bears down on them. 

     More shells fired.  They punch into and through the rocks our
     boys use for cover.  Again the three scatter, and just in
     time as the shells rip their way through the rock.

     Our three go sliding down an embankment, crouching low.
     Their heads whip around looking for the gunship.

                          JAEGER 
                Where is it?  Where'd it go? 

                          EPPS
                Stay low. 

                          JAEGER 
                Where the hell is it!? 

                          EPPS
                Just stay down. 

     In answer to Jaeger's question the gunship comes swooping up
     behind them like a bird of prey.  Our three have all of about
     a second to get running before the Iraqis send more shells
     their way.  They kick up chunks of rock as they ping, ping, 
     ping around Epps, Wes and Jaeger who make a wild, evasive
     run.

     Dig it:  Up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face.
     They race for it, hurl themselves into it as the gunship
     sends a special delivery of white-hot metal their way. 

     Once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space.
     It's too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through. 
     Our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck
     air.

     Beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and
     forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom. 

     Jaeger's worked up a real scare. 

                          JAEGER 
                What are we going to do?  What the hell
                are we going to do? 

                          EPPS 
                We're not going to do anything.

                          JAEGER
                     (Panicked) 
                They're going to kill us!

                          EPPS
                They can't shoot us in here.

                          WES 
                And they can't fly around out there
                forever.

                          EPPS
                So we wait. 

                          JAEGER
                If they land-- 

                          EPPS 
                If they land, we can take them.  If they
                don't land, then we've got nothing to
                worry about. 

     Wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air.
     It floats very steady as if...  Wes' eyes key in on 
     something:  The gunship's missile pods rotating slightly, 
     coming in line... Wes' eyes go wide like someone just jammed
     an electric cattle prod in his ass. 

                          WES
                Missile! 

                          EPPS
                Move! 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of
     the passage as a missile rockets from the gunship's pod.
     With a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow
     straight into the passage.  Slamming into the ground it
     sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive 
     explosion.  It races through the passage, lifts our boys from
     the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were
     nothing more than discarded ragdolls.

     Jaeger takes cover and cowers.  He puts his panic into
     overdrive. 

     Wes pulls his rifle.  Grunting like an animal he sprays 
     bullets at the chopter, but it's like throwing snowballs at
     an elephant.  The gunship turns on Wes and fires in his 
     direction.  It doesn't hit him, but it sends him running.

     Epps has had enough of this shit.  He scrambles to load a 
     grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about.  It races 
     for him, cannons at the ready.  This one is going to be 
     close.  Epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down 
     on him.  Epps fires, but the gunship simply jukes up and away
     from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug.  The
     grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding
     harmlessly.  The chopter returns the favor by reining down a
     hail of shells that kicks Epps back FLIPPING HIM UP AND OVER
     the edge of the plateau.  His M-16 goes flying, smashing into
     the ground far below.  Epps manages to grab hold of the 
     plateau lip with one hand.  It swings him around, slamming 
     him hard against the cliff face.  He hangs there, suspended by
     his weakening grip, far above the ground.

                          JAEGER
                Epps! 

     Jaeger and Wes run to him, grabbing him by his arm.  They
     pull and pull hard until Epps can get some kind of purchase,
     and crawl his way back up to the plateau.

     At the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers
     above and beyond our three.  It rotates so that the bay doors
     are facing Epps, Wes and Jaeger.  Three Iraqis are inside,
     weapons trained on our targets.  One of them yells something.
     Wes translates.

                          WES 
                They want us to surrender.

     The three share a nervous look.  Epps fairly growls:

                          EPPS 
                Yeah, I'll surrender. 

     Jaeger and Wes watch as, shielded by their bodies, Epps palms
     a grenade from his belt.  Wes and Jaeger don't quite smile,
     but they know now they at least have a chance.  As Epps
     stands the other two turn to face the Iraqis.  They all fold
     their hands behind their necks which, for Epps, hides the
     grenade from view.  Slowly they walk towards the gunship.
     One of the Iraqis starts to yell something.  He lifts his
     weapon and aims it at our boys.  With his thumb Epps yanks 
     the pin from the grenade and lets fly.  It's a perfect toss,
     landing in the chopter's bay.  The Iraqis see the grenade 
     land, they scramble for it.  One of them grabs it up and is
     about to throw it back out of the gunship. 

     Too late. 

     The grenade explodes in the Iraqi's hand killing him
     instantly.  It also touches off a fire ball that severely 
     damages the gunship.  It rocks, lists, spins wildly out of
     control. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Get down!

     Our three hug the ground as the chopter's rotors go whipping
     through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among
     them.  Worse still the gunship, now a lame bird, drops from
     the sky towards Epps, Jaeger and Wes.  All they can do is 
     cover their heads, as if that would do any good against two
     tons of crashing steel.  The chopter rushes down...down, but
     it just misses them.  It slams into the ground skipping over
     the edge of the plateau, to the rocks below. 

     Our three pick themselves up.  They walk to the edge of the
     plateau and look down on the crash. 

     Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees
     and looks as if he's about to go into shock.

                          JAEGER
                Oh, God... 

     Wes looks down at Jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer. 

                          WES 
                Yeah.  Just keeps getting better and
                better, doesn't it? 

     They stare for awhile, then one by one move off.  Us?  We:

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT/MESA - LATER 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger trek to a large crevice that runs 
     straight down into the ground.  Jaeger takes out his maps and
     photos.  Epps consults the navicom.

                          WES 
                What do you think? 

                          JAEGER 
                Lines up with the map and the photos.

                          EPPS 
                We're right where we should be. 

     Epps tucks the navicom away on his belt and takes a look
     around.  Not much to see.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                I sure don't see much place else around
                here to hide anything.

     Wes pulls a lantern/flashlight from his pack.  Going to his
     belly he shines it down into the crevice.

                          WES 
                Can't see anything.

     He tosses a rock into it.  We can hear it hit the ground below.

                          WES(CONT)
                It's got a bottom. 

                          JAEGER 
                Guess we know what the next stop is. 

                          EPPS 
                All right.  Let's break out some utility 
                shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case
                we have to do any blasting.  Me and 
                Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can
                see. 

                          WES 
                What am I supposed to do? 

                          EPPS 
                Got to have someone here in case we need
                help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to
                have a look out either. 

                          JAEGER 
                Think there might be more Iraqis? 

                          EPPS 
                Right now I wouldn't be surprised if 
                Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The
                Clowns. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     WE SEE A FEW QUICK SHOTS of Wes securing a line down into the
     crevice, Epps and Jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses, the
     two men lowering themselves down into the great unknown.

                                                            CUT TO: 

     INT. CREVICES - CONTINUOUS 

     The lantern punches a hole through the darkness as Epps uses
     it like a machete to blaze a trial.  He sinks down...down 
     until finally they touch bottom.  He unclips himself from the
     rope and Jaeger starts down.

     The space isn't that big, like a small cave really.  It's 
     tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole
     of it.  But it's big enough that one wouldn't have any idea
     where to start digging. 

     Jaeger makes it to the bottom.  Wes yells down. 

                          WES
                You down? 

                          JAEGER
                Yeah, we're down. 

                          WES 
                What do you see? 

                          EPPS
                Nothing. 

     More to himself:

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                A whole lot of nothing. 

                          JAEGER 
                So where do we start? 

     Epps takes a look around, then shrugs.

                          EPPS 
                Wherever you want. 

     Epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack.  Jaeger
     follows suit.  He looks around, picks a spot and starts
     digging. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     He sits up top, weapon in hand, standing guard.

     EPPS AND JAEGER - LATER

     They dig furiously at sperate ends of the cave.  They dig
     with a determination to find something.

     WES - LATER 

     Still up top, he's given up on standing guard.  Now he
     stretches out on the ground sunning himself.

                                                           FADE TO:

     EPPS AND JAEGER 

     Their shirts are off, and they're caked with sweat and dirt. 
     They look like they've been digging for quite some time. 

     They certainly don't have the same enthusiasm they displayed
     previously.  Now they just seem to dig by rote. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     WES - LATER 

     The sun has begun to sink noticeably.  Wes leans over the 
     crevice. 

                          WES 
                Hey...Hey!  Sun's going down.  Epps!
                Jaeger!  It's getting dark up here. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS AND JAEGER - SIMULTANEOUS 

     It's obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come 
     up with nothing.  Epps keeps digging, but just barely. 
     Jaeger doesn't even bother anymore.  He just sits on the
     ground sulking.

                          WES(O.C.)
                Epps! 

                          EPPS
                I heard!

     He rolls over and scoffs.

                          WES
                There's nothing down there.

                                                            CUT TO: 

     EPPS AND JAEGER

     Epps notices Jaeger just sitting there.

                          EPPS
                What are you doing? 

                          JAEGER 
                What does it look like I'm doing?

                It looks like you're not doing anything. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything,
                because there's nothing down here. 

                          EPPS
                Get up and dig.

                          JAEGER 
                We've been digging.  We've been digging
                for hours.  If there was anything here to
                find we would have found it. 

                          EPPS 
                Get up off your ass and dig! 

     Sounding defeated as all hell, and very whiney:

                          JAEGER 
                What's the point?  There's nothing here.
                The map's a fake.  Christ, even I see 
                that now.  We're just wasting our time.
                We might as well give up and-- 

     Epps spins.  Like a bolt of lightning he's on Jaeger,
     grabbing him up and pulling him close. 

                          EPPS 
                You listen to me.  The whole reason we're
                here is because of you and that map of 
                yours.  I didn't do all this for nothing,
                and I'm not leaving with nothing.  If you
                think for a second I'm giving up just 
                'cause you're too tired to turn over some
                dirt, then you don't know John Epps too 
                well, do you?  So you dig, and you keep
                on digging 'til I say you don't have to
                dig anymore.

     Epps pushes Jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard.
     A fire burns inside him.  A fire that burns out of control.
     Before he even knows what he's doing Jaeger springs to his
     feet, shovel in hand, bringing it down in a long arc for
     Epps' head.

     Epps bears him coming.  He deftly side steps the blow, grabs
     hold of Jaeger and forces him down.  They roll around
     violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the
     other into a choke hold.

     He can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down.

                          WES
                What are you doing...?  What the hell are
                you doing down there?

     EPPS AND JAEGER 

     They fight on; down and dirty.  Locked together they roll
     around the ground, each trying to get the upper hand.  They
     smash into the lantern, sending the cave into near darkness.
     At the same time Epps works himself on top of Jaeger.  He
     lands a couple of solid punches, takes a rock from the ground 
     and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into Jaeger's
     skull.  All Jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow. 

     Something catches Epps' eye:  A glint of light flashes across
     his faces.  He stares at it; at an opening, a bare seem
     really, in the side of the cave wall where light seeps 
     through.  The rock slips from his hand.  Forgetting all about
     Jaeger Epps goes to the opening.  Jaeger himself, as if what
     just happened hadn't really happened, comes up along side
     Epps.

                          JAEGER 
                Must be a compartment. 

                          EPPS 
                I feel air.  Probably opens up outside 
                somewhere.  That's where the light comes 
                from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon. 

     Jaeger says what they both must have guessed by now. 

                          JAEGER 
                The white dot; light in the dark. 

     That's all Epps needs to hear.  He starts clawing at the
     opening with his bare hands.  That gets him nothing. 
     Grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it.  Jaeger gets 
     the lantern working again, then picks up his shovel and joins
     in.  They keep hitting and hitting, picking up a rhythm like
     a southern chain gang. 

                          JAEGER (CONT)
                Maybe we should blast it loose with the
                claymore. 

                          EPPS
                It's giving. 

     The rock gives way enough for Epps to pry it free.  There's
     just enough space for a man to reach his arm through.  For a
     beat Epps and Jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid
     of what mayor may not be in there.

     With some trepidation Epps begins to move his hand towards 
     the opening.  Slowly it extends closer...closer...  Just as
     it moves beyond the opening. vThere is a wild, screeching 
     hiss as some small, hairy thing leaps for Epps.

     Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear. 

                          JAEGER
                Jesus Christ! 

     Jaeger grabs up his M-16 and takes aim at...whatever it is.

                          EPPS 
                No, don't shoot! 

     Too late. Jaeger squeezes off a few rounds.  A couple of
     bullets hit the thing, but the rest ricochet wildly about the
     cave and around Epps and Jaeger.  All the two men can do is
     duck and cover - squeezing themselves into tight, fetal balls
     - as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of
     random death. 

     Eventually the bullets lose speed and die off.  Jaeger and
     Epps raise up off the ground.  They walk to the dead thing
     that jumped from the opening.

                          EPPS 
                It's just a mongoose. 

                          JAEGER
                Is it dead? 

                          EPPS
                Yeah, Bwana, you got it.

                I think we found something. 

     They go back to the opening.  Epps shines a light inside to
     make sure there are no more surprises, then reaches an arm
     in.  Jaeger looks on with great anticipation, licking his
     lips like a hungry jackal, as Epps twists his arm in the
     opening.  Searching...searching... 

     Epps' face freezes.  He goes perfectly still for a beat, then
     slowly draws his hand from the opening.  It clutches a wooden
     box.  It is similar to Jaeger's puzzle box, but slightly
     bigger.  The instant Epps sets the box on the ground Jaeger
     smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood.  From
     the splinters pours a river of gold coins.  Jaeger and Epps
     are too stunned to do anything but look at it.

     He leans over the crevice.

                Gold.  It's gold.

     Jaeger yells it at the top of his lungs:

                          JAEGER
                IT'S GOLD!

     His lips flutter a bit before they land on the word

     They scoop up handfuls of the coins and let them run through
     their fingers.

                          JAEGER 
                It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And
                it's heavier than I imagined. 

                          EPPS 
                I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this.
                Not in my whole life did I ever imagine
                this. 

                          JAEGER 
                You don't have to imagine it.  Not 
                anymore.  Now all you've got to think up 
                is what it's going to buy you.

     Epps grabs up one coin and stands.

                          EPPS
                Wes! 

     With all his strength Epps gives the coin an underhanded toss
     straight up.

     Wes catches the coin.  He turns it over in his fingers.  He
     smiles, and there's nothing pleasant about it.

                          EPPS 
                Wes, thrown down a pack.

     A beat later an empty pack comes falling down.  Epps picks it
     up and takes it over to Jaeger.  The two of them start
     loading the coins into it. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                I don't think the line will take the

                Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me

                Ready when you are. 

     Epps is just about to attach the pack of gold to the line
     when Jaeger grabs his arm. 

                          JAEGER
                Wait. 

                          EPPS
                What?

                          EPPS(CONT)
                What? 

                          JAEGER 
                We send the gold up what's to stop him

                          EPPS 
                He's not going to leave us. 

                          JAEGER 
                What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All
                he has to do is cut the line...

     Good point.  What is to stop him? 

                          WES

                          JAEGER 
                Why do I have to stay down here? 

                          EPPS
                Jesus, Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't see how that plan's any better.

                          EPPS 
                Someone's got to send the gold up.  It
                can't get on the line by itself. 

                          JAGER 
                Why's it got to be me? 

     A tense moment passes.

                          WES
                What are you doing?  You ready? 

     Another moment, then:

                          EPPS 
                All right.  You go up, I'll send up the
                gold, then follow. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work. 

     Jaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on.  He's just
     about ready to climb up when Epps stops him.  Serious as a
     heart attack he says:

                          EPPS 
                If you're even thinking about leaving me
                down here, you better think again. 

     Jaeger stares at Epps for a beat, then laughs himself a
     little laugh.  He yells up:

                          JAEGER 
                Wes, I'm coming up.

     Jaeger starts to climb as Wes helps out by pulling on the 
     rope. 

     Epps watches him for a bit, then looks at the pack of gold
     and the rest of the equipment.  Suddenly he scurries about
     gathering up all the things they've brought down.

     Jaeger continues his climb, disappearing up into the crevice.
     A few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from, 
     above.  Epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to
     the rope.  Yelling up:

                          EPPS
                Okay! 

     The rope goes taught, slowly drawing the pack up, up into the
     crevice finally to be swallowed from view. 

     Epps waits for the rope to come back down.  He waits.  He
     waits a beat more.  No rope. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Wes?  Jaeger? 

     He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it
     creeps in anyway.  He tries it again.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Jaeger? 

     Still more nothing.  What's that sound?  It's Epps' breath
     getting heavier and faster. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Jaeger!? 

     Nothing.  Then something.  The rope snakes its way back down.
     Epps can't help but let go of a little laugh, like a guy
     who's just been given a scare by his own shadow.  Taking up 
     his own pack Epps hooks up, then starts the climb to the top.

     JAEGER AND WES 

     They work the rope, helping Epps up.  He gets to the lip of
     the crevice, and pulls himself over.  He's breathing hard,
     and lets his pack slide to the ground.  Trying not to sound
     too rattled.

                          EPPS

                          JAEGER 
                Just had to get the pack unhooked from

     Epps lets this go.

                We started this together, and we're

                          WES

                          JAEGER 
                Wes might be right about that. 

                          EPPS 
                It stays as it is.  We're halfway home
                now.  Let's not blow it by people getting 
                ideas. 

                          WES 
                You're the one with all the ideas.

                          EPPS 
                You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.

                          WES 
                Maybe you've got ideas of your own for
                the gold.  Maybe you've already got
                things worked out.

                          EPPS
                Maybe I do.

                          WES 
                Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I
                can do better on my own. 

     Epps sees trouble coming, and deals with it the only way he
     knows how.  Casually he turns from Wes as if he's about to
     let things go.  Suddenly he spins back around throwing a
     punch to Wes' jaw that sends him to the ground.

     Wes puts a hand to his mouth.  It comes back stained red.
     Wes goes on the boil. 

                          WES(CONT)
                You got no reason to do that!

                          EPPS 
                I told you:  When I straighten someone 
                out they stay straightened.  This is how
                it works:  Nobody touches the gold.
                Except when we're on the move and 
                someone's carrying it, nobody so much as
                opens the pack to get an eyeful of it.
                Agreed? 

     Jaeger wastes no time jumping in. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  Sure.  That sounds like a plan to
                me. 

     Wes, still on the ground, fumes. 

                          WES 
                You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting
                tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around. 

                          EPPS
                Then get up and do something about it.

     Wes thinks about it, but that's all he does.  He's not ready
     to cross that line yet. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Then just lay there and bleed. 

     Epps takes up his pack and moves off to bed down.  Jaeger
     does the same.  Wes just lays on the ground...and bleeds.

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. MESA - EARLY MORNING 

     The first light of day barely begins to fight its way through
     the dark.  Our boys sleep in a circle around the pack filled
     with gold.  Surprisingly they seem to sleep pretty well, but
     then the last twenty-four hours has taken a lot out of them.

     There is a slight sound: Rocks crunching underneath a foot.
     Someone stirs, someone moves.  It's hard to tell who it is in 
     this bad light.  They creep towards the pack, inching their
     way closer and closer.  They reach out a hand, just about to
     grab the pack.

     Wes, who obviously wasn't asleep at all, lunges for the 
     person, and takes them down hard.  There's the ugly crunch of
     body against stone as they hit the ground.  M-16 in hand Wes
     straddles the intruder pressing the muzzle of the rifle
     against his head. 

                          WES 
                Stay down.  Stay the hell down, or I will
                rip your stinking head off! 

     Underneath him, an IRAQI SOLDIER - who already looks very
     badly injured; bloody, cut, slightly burned - babbles back in
     high pitched and frightened Arabic.

     This is enough to wake Jaeger and Epps. 

                          JAGER
                What the hell?

                          WES 
                I caught him!  I caught him trying to
                steal the gold. 

                          EPPS
                Get off him. 

                          WES 
                     (Slightly crazed) 
                He snuck in here thinking we were asleep,
                only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit
                our throats if I hadn't stopped him. 

                          EPPS
                Get off him! 

     Epps reaches down and physically pulls Wes from the soldier
     who still rattles on. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                What happened?

                          WES 
                I told you.  He tried to steal our gold.
                He tried to kill us.

                          JAEGER 
                With what?  He doesn't have a weapon. 

                          WES 
                He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a 
                weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare
                hands. 

     The soldier goes on babbling.  Wes has had just about enough
     of that.  He gives the soldier a kick to the ribs. 

                          WES(CONT)
                Shut up! 

     Epps gives Wes a hard push. 

                          EPPS
                Stop it! 

                          WES 
                I told you; don't push me around. 

     Even now, frightened but more calmly, the soldier goes on.

                          EPPS 
                Tell me what he's saying.

     Wes listens, but with disdain.  He translates:

                          WES 
                Says he's one of the soldiers that was in
                the helicopter. 

                          JAEGER 
                He lived through that? 

     The soldier goes on, and so does Wes.

                          WES 
                Says they were deserters, they were 
                afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam
                anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to
                hide out.  When they saw us they figured
                we were going to kill them, so they shot
                first. 

                          EPPS 
                Why'd he come in our camp. 

     Wes asks him the question in Arabic and gets an answer.  It's
     enough to give Wes a bit of a laugh. 

                          WES 
                Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted
                the gold. 

                          EPPS 
                How's he going to want the gold?  He
                couldn't even know we had it.

                          WES 
                He...he could have been watching us.

                          JAEGER 
                Maybe we should give him some water. 

                          WES 
                All last night he could have been-- 

                          JAEGER 
                I think he wants something to drink. 

                          WES 
                I'm not wasting my water on him. 

     Jaeger gets his water and gives some to the soldier.

                          WES(CONT) 
                I don't care what he says, he wanted our
                gold.  Would have slit our throats if he
                had the chance.

                          EPPS 
                Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he 
                didn't get it.  We've got no need staying
                around here.  It's light enough.  Let's
                pack up and head out. 

     Jaeger and Epps start to go for their gear.  Wes is still on
     the Iraqi soldier.

                          WES 
                What about him?  We...we have to do
                something.

     Epps gives an expression that screams:  What the hell are you
     talking about?

                          WES(CONT) 
                We can't just leave him.  He'll run back
                to his outfit, report our position... 

                          EPPS 
                You said he was a deserter. 

                          WES 
                That's what he says.  He could be a spy,
                or something. 

                          EPPS 
                You don't know that. 

                          WES
                You don't know he isn't. 

                          JAEGER 
                So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til
                we get back to the Hummer. 

                          WES 
                He'd just slow us down, and drink our
                water.  And if we ran into any more
                Iraqis you know he'd sell us out. 

                          EPPS 
                We don't leave him, we don't take him
                with us.  What does that leave? 

     By way of answering Wes lifts his M-16 and works the action.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You're out of your mind.

                          WES 
                He's an enemy soldier.

                          EPPS 
                I'm not going to let you kill him.

                          WES
                We're at war. 

     The discussion starts to get real heated.

                          EPPS 
                We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger
                are AWOL.  We have no authority-- 

                          WES 
                He tried to kill us.  If not just now,
                then in the helicopter.  That's all the
                authority I need. 

     Jaeger goes somewhere near panic.

                          JAEGER
                We don't need to do this.  We got the 
                gold, all right?  Let's just get out of
                here. 

     The Iraqi may not speak the language, but he's got a pretty
     good idea what they are arguing about.  He starts to plead
     for his life

                          WES 
                I'm not going to leave him be just so he
                can stab us in the backs the minute we
                turn around.  I have been through too
                much to lose it all now just because the
                two of you don't have the stomach to do
                what has to be done. 

                          EPPS 
                I've got no stomach for murder. 

                          WES 
                It's a combat action. 

                          EPPS 
                It's murder, and I won't be any part of
                it. 

                          WES 
                Then step aside. 

                          EPPS
                No. 

                          WES 
                Get out of my way. 

     The Iraqis begging goes into over drive.  Jaeger just about
     loses it.

                          JAEGER 
                For Christ's sake, we don't need this.
                Let's just go.  Let's just...let's just
                get out of here. 

     Wes yells down at the Iraqi. 

                          WES 
                Shut up!  Shut the hell up! 

     Wes moves menacingly for the Iraqi.  He thrusts his M-16
     forward.  Epps grabs it, and throws a punch.  Unlike before 
     with Jaeger, this time Wes ducks the blow and swings the butt
     of the M-16 back at Epps.  It's not much of a blow though, 
     and Epps keeps on coming.  He barrels into Wes and takes him
     down. 

     As the two men tussle the Iraqi sees his chance to get away.
     He springs up, knocking Jaeger to the side, and bolts past
     him.

                          JAGER 
                He's getting away! 

     Epps turns and sees this.  Maybe he's not for killing this 
     guy, but he certainly can't just let him get away.  He takes
     off running after the Iraqi, Jaeger a step behind. 

     The Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like
     a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to 
     climb to the plateau above.  He knows if he can make it he at
     least has a chance of getting away.  It shows in the
     desperation he climbs with. 

     Epps and Jaeger are right behind him.  They claw at the
     rocks, but can't gain ground.

     The Iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau; to freedom.
     Our two soldiers scramble up right behind him.

     The Iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau.  He's just
     about to pull himself up.  He's just about to get away-- 

     WE HEAR A SHORT BURST OF GUNFIRE.  Three large, bloody holes
     mushroom open in the Iraqi's back.

                                                            CUT TO:

     WES 

     He stands, smoke curling from the muzzle of his M-16 like a 
     white snake, having just send the Iraqi some bullets special
     delivery. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE IRAQI 

     He arches, stiffens, then falls like a stone past Epps and
     Jaeger to the ground below like a sack of potatoes.

     As the two climb down Wes goes to the body and stands over it
     like the great, white hunter standing over his kill.  All
     business like he says:

                          WES 
                I had to.  You saw how he ran.  Would
                have given us away.  I had to. 

     There's a beat of quiet, then: 

                          JAEGER 
                Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him.
                Say some words over him. 

                          WES 
                You want to say some words? 

     He sneers down at the body.

                          WES(CONT) 
                Go to hell.  How are those words? 

     Wes moves off.  A beat later Jaeger walks away.  Epps just
     stands there looking at the body. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. MESA - LATER 

     Wes, Epps and Jaeger are making the trek back down.  Jaeger 
     is shouldering the pack with the gold.  Wes has got his M-16. 
     Epps stops, and puts his pack down.  He takes out the navicom
     and a recon photo. 

                          EPPS
                We should head Northeast. 

                          JAEGER 
                Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer;
                further into Iraqi.

                          EPPS 
                There's another pass on the photo.  We 
                can avoid that narrow one we had to cross
                on the way up, and it should get us back
                down. 

                          JAEGER 
                It should, or it will?  Least going back
                the way we came we know what we're up
                against. 

                          EPPS 
                You think you can make that pass weighted
                down when you almost fell the first time
                you're wrong, and you're not going to 
                take my share of the gold with you trying
                it.  We're heading Northeast. 

     Really calm, cold and direct Wes says:

                          WES
                You've got an awful lot of orders in you.
                Always giving orders. 

                          EPPS 
                I out rank you, that's why. 

                          WES 
                In the service you do, but we're not 
                particularly in the service right now.
                Way I see it, what we're doing, that 
                doesn't particularly give you the right
                to toss orders around. 

     Epps loads up his pack pretty much ignoring Wes. 

                          EPPS 
                We been down this road.  I told you how
                it is.  Unless you feel like there's
                something you want to do about it... 

                          WES
                What if I do? 

     Epps says nothing, so Wes tries it again a little harder. 

                          WES(CONT)
                What if I do? 

     He works the action of his M-16. 

                          WES(CONT) 
                You talk loud, and don't even have a big
                stick to back it up with. 

     Real casual Epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the
     pin loose.  He stands with the grenade in one hand and the
     navicom in the other.  Real calm, like he was talking about
     the weather:

                          EPPS 
                Something happens to me I let go of this
                grenade.  I go, and I take the navicom
                with me.  And how do you suppose you're 
                going to find your way back to the Hummer,
                when you won't even know what's up or 
                down.  It's a big country, and you could
                be heading for the allies, or wandering 
                right into Bhagdad.  That's if you don't
                die of thirst before you even get that
                far.  How you like my stick now? 

     Epps and Wes have a stare down.  Jaeger, who's getting really
     good at freaking out, jumps in. 

                          JAEGER 
                Why don't you put the gun down, all 
                right, Wes?  You put the gun down and 
                Epps'll put the pin back in the grenade.
                Won't you Epps? 

     The stare down goes on a beat longer.  Finally Wes lowers his
     rifle.  He turns to Jaeger and vents what anger he can. 

                          WES 
                I'm starting to think you're a real
                bitch, you know that?

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     THE CAMERA PANS over the vast expanse of nothingness.  SMOKE 
     BEGINS TO DRIFT INTO FRAME.  THE CAMERA FINALLY LANDS ON THE
     SHI'ITE ENCAMPMENT, or at least what's left of it.  Tents are
     torn down and burned, goods scattered.  It looks like a ghost
     town.  Epps, Wes and Jaeger wander into it.  They look
     around, but see no signs of life. 

     Wes grabs up some Shi'ite garments, white robes, and starts
     to put them on. 

                          JAEGER 
                You're going to burn up in those. 

                          WES 
                The white reflects the sun; it keeps you
                cooler.  That's why they wear them. 

     Jaeger looks to Epps who just shrugs.  Jaeger gets some robes
     and puts them on.  Epps follows suit. 

                          JAEGER 
                Think the Iraqi's killed them all?

                          WES 
                Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest.
                Murderers. 

                          EPPS
                     (Pointed) 
                Murder, or a combat action?  It's hard to
                tell them apart? 

     They keep on moving, passing straight through the camp.  Epps
     marches ahead, not wanting to even deal with the other two 
     men.  Wes talks after him.  Really he talks more to himself,
     and he's not sounding too lucid. 

                          WES 
                You saw how he ran didn't you?  First
                chance he got he ran out.  Would have
                gone straight to his CO, told him all 
                about the gold.  What do you think would
                have happened then, huh?  Then what do 
                you think would have happened?  Two 
                thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on
                us.  You ought to thank me for killing 
                him.  I'll get a medal for it.  Watch and
                see if I don't get a medal. 

     Epps isn't even paying attention, he's just walking on. 
     Almost, as if he senses something is wrong, he stops in his
     tracks.  He looks down at his feet and sees the most curious
     thing.  SAND IS RUSHING AWAY FROM HIS FEET, ALMOST AS IF IT'S
     GOING DOWN A DRAIN.  He looks at it with the same wonderment
     that a dog watches television. 

                          EPPS 
                What the hell...? 

     Epps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a
     moment later the Earth literally drops from beneath his feet.
     He's standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in
     loose sand.  Immediately he sinks to waist level.  He slows
     there, but still goes down with rapidity.  He screams to 
     Jaeger and Wes.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Help!  Help me! 

     Jaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole.  Wes
     doesn't move. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Help me!

     Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision.  He doesn't want to let
     Epps drown, but if he gets too close he could easily get 
     sucked into.  He flirts back and forth between rescue and
     safety. 

     Sand continues to pour in on Epps. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                For Christ's Sake, Jaeger!  Help me!
                Help me! 

     Jaeger can't fight himself any longer.  He lowers himself
     halfway into the hole, stretching spread eagle trying to keep
     some kind of grip on the firmer ground, and reaches for Epps. 

     Their arms twist and strain for each others.  First their 
     fingers meet, then they grab hands.  They work a grip down to
     their wrist, but that's all they can get.  Jaeger strains 
     like a field horse pulling Epps against the sand.  It may not
     be enough as he begins to slip down himself.  Jaeger twists
     his head and looks up at Wes.  Straining to say anything he
     pleads: 

                          JAEGER
                Wes...Wes! 

     His words fall on deaf ears.  Wes just takes a step closer to
     the pack of gold coins. 

     This only serves to energize Jaeger.  He digs deeper within
     himself finding an untapped reserve of strength.  He grunts
     and pulls, the veins on his neck puffing like balloons. 

     Epps finds same purchase.  He pulls, swims, his way up from
     the sand.  A little at first, but like hitting shallow water
     he's able to lift himself up. 

     Jager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground.  They
     collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air. 

     As Epps regains strength he pats himself down.  Suddenly he
     goes back into a panic. 

                          EPPS
                The navicom!

     Epps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft
     sand frantically looking for the lost computer.  Jaeger joins
     in.  They dig and scrape as best they can, but daring to
     venture only so far into the soft sand.  It doesn't matter.
     The navicom is lost. 

                          JAEGER 
                What are we going to do?  How are we
                going to find our way back!? 

                          EPPS 
                We'll find our way. 

                          JAEGER
                How!? 

                          EPPS 
                We'll find our way!  We'll... 

     Epps wants to say how, but he's got no idea.  Wes grows a
     smug smile. 

                          WES 
                No navicom.  A lot of good you are now,
                Epps. 

                          EPPS 
                Lot of good you were when I was sinking
                in the sand. 

                          WES 
                Without that navicam looks to me like you
                forfeit the right to be in charge. 

                          EPPS 
                And let me guess who is. 

     Wes casually slides out his M-16.

                          WES 
                I'm the one's got the big stick. 

                          EPPS 
                Suppose I don't go for that? 

                          WES 
                Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and
                I suppose I'd have to kill you.
                     (Beat)
                I suppose. 

                          EPPS 
                What about Jaeger? 

                          WES 
                Nothing about him, unless he's got a
                problem about me dealing with you. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, I got a problem with you killing Epps. 

     Wes turns and glares at Jaeger, who backs down. 

                          JAEGER(CONT}
                I mean, in principle. 

                          WES 
                     {Sneering) 
                You know, Jaeger, you really are a bitch. 

     Epps isn't wasting anymore time.  When Wes turns to glower at
     Jaeger he lunges up for him.  Wes side steps Epps and lands 
     the but of his rifle into the side of Epps' head.  It opens a
     wound, and sends Epps back down to the ground. 

     Epps looks up right into the muzzle of West M-16.  Full of
     poison: 

                          WES(CONT)
                You die! 

     Wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot 
     rings out.  Wes' body jerks like he's just been hit in the
     back with a truck.  The way cut timber falls he slams to the
     ground motionless. 

     Epps and Jaeger stare at the body for a beat, then snap their
     heads in the direction of the shot. 

     Up on a dune behind them are a group of SHI'ITES on 
     horseback.  One of them has a high powered rifle which he has
     just used to drill Wes.  He fires another shot.  It pings to
     the ground between Epps and Jaeger. 

     Our two remaining men scramble.  Jaeger dives for the gold 
     and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it.
     The two take off running as best they can in the sand.  They
     run wildly, erratically, without looking back.  They run
     until their bodies scream no more, then keep going on 
     inertia.  Reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and
     collapse in a heap at the bottom.  They take a moment to
     catch what breath they can, then: 

                          EPPS 
                We got to go back.  We got to go back for
                Wes. 

                          JAEGER
                Forget Wes. 

                          EPPS
                We can't just leave him. 

                          JAEGER
                Wes is dead! 

                          EPPS 
                What if he's not? 

                          JAEGER 
                Then he will be when those Iraqis get to
                him.  He was going to kill you.  He was 
                one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps,
                and I'm sure as hell not getting my head
                blow off over his carcass. 

     They sit there trying to catch their breath.  As they do a
     sound comes from the distance.  They freeze, ears cocked,
     trying to figure out what it is. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                It's a helicopter. 

     Quickly, desperately, as the sound of the chopter draws 
     closer, they scan the horizon looking for it.  Jaeger spots
     it and thrusts a finger in its direction. 

                          JAGER(CONT)
                There. 

     Epps scrambles out his binoculars.  He targets the
     helicopter.  Jaeger waits in high anticipation. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Ours, or theirs? 

     Epps can't make out for sure.  Jaeger asks again with growing
     anxiety. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                Ours, or theirs?

     Epps takes a long, hard stare.

                          EPPS 
                Ours.  It's one of ours.  We've got to
                signal them; let them know we're down
                here. 

     The instant Jaeger hears this his face twists up like he's
     thinking something, and he doesn't like what it is he's
     thinking.  Quietly, almost to himself: 

                          JAEGER
                No.

                          EPPS 
                We need something:  A flare, a signal
                mirror. 

     Again Jaeger says it, this time including Epps too. 

                          JAEGER
                No. 

                          EPPS 
                What do you mean no?  They can fly us home. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                They'll ask questions; want to know why
                we were out here. 

                          EPPS
                We'll lie. 

                          JAEGER 
                They'll search the pack. 

     Epps finds a mirror in one of his pockets.  He stands, ready
     to signal the chopter. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                They'll find the gold. 

     Epps turns sharply back to Jaeger.

                          EPPS 
                We're lost, you understand that?  We've
                got no navicom, and no means to find a
                way back.  So right now I don't give a 
                damn about the gold because if we don't 
                get off this desert, and out of Iraqi all
                it's going to be good for is buying us
                tombstones. 

     Epps is back around ready to signal the helicopter.  He's
     about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an M-16
     action being worked.  Epps turns to face Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 
                I can't do it, Epps.  Not when we're so 
                close.  I can't let you ruin everything. 

     Epps just stares at Jaeger, not frightened, but surprisingly
     calm.

                          EPPS 
                First Wes, now you? 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.

                          EPPS 
                     (Sarcastic) 
                And you; you've got it all together. 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't 
                kill you just to kill you, but I can't 
                let you lose the gold for me.  Not when
                we're so close. 

                          EPPS 
                That helicopter passes, and the only
                thing we're close to is death. 

     Jaeger is unfazed.  Very politely he says:

                          JAEGER
                Sit down, Epps. 

     Epps takes him up on the offer.  What choice does he have?
     THE CAMERA STAYS TIGHT ON THE TWO MEN.  They don't talk.
     They don't move.  They just sit as WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE
     HELICOPTER GETTING CLOSER AND LOUDER.  IT REACHES A
     CRESCENOO, THEN BEGINS TO FADE UNTIL IT DISAPPEARS.  The
     chopter is gone, along with Epps and Jaeger's best chance of 
     getting out of the desert alive. 

     Jaeger lowers his rifle.  Very genuinely he says:

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I'm sorry about that, Epps. 

                          EPPS
                Is it all right if I stand up? 

     Like he didn't know he was keeping Epps from something. 

                          JAEGER 
                Oh, yeah.  Go ahead. 

     Epps stands.  He looks around trying to figure things out. 
     Not much to figure.  There still in the middle of a desert in
     a hostile country same as they ever were. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm
                glad it didn't come to that. 

                          EPPS 
                Yeah.  Well, me too. 

                          JAEGER 
                I never killed anybody before.  I talk a
                good game, but I'm not like that. 

                          EPPS
                Sure. 

                          JAEGER 
                Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was 
                talking I wanted to blow away all those
                Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I
                was scared out of my mind to go to war.
                I still haven't gotten over stepping on
                that land mine. 

                          EPPS 
                You still got a map on you? 

                          JAEGER
                What?  Yeah. 

     Jaeger takes out the maps he has and hands them to Epps. 
     Epps looks them over, then looks over the terrain.  Without
     any landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be
     finger paintings.

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Epps? 

                          EPPS
                Yeah. 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't want to die. 

                          EPPS 
                Makes two of us. 

                          JAEGER 
                I know what I did just now was crazy, but
                you got to understand how much I want
                that gold. 

                          EPPS 
                It's all right.  I don't like it, but
                it's over now. 

                          JAEGER 
                I never had anything before, Epps.  I
                never was anybody.  Not the kind of 
                somebody you can be with a pocket full of
                gold coins.  When I was in high school I 
                used to-- 

     Fed up with Jaeger Epps turns on him hard.

                          EPPS 
                Hey, you know what?  Can I be honest with
                you?  Right now I'm not all that 
                interested in how you're messed up 'cause
                you didn't get the bicycle you wanted for
                your thirteenth birthday.  What I'm 
                interested in is how I can keep from
                getting dead.  And listening to sob 
                stories from some           about how the
                system wasn't good to him because he had
                to work like everybody else instead of
                being born a Kennedy doesn't do a damn 
                thing to help keep me alive.  So do me a 
                favor; either shut up, or...just shut up. 

     Jaeger isn't sure what to say. 

                          JAEGER
                Sorry. 

                          EPPS 
                Damn. 

     Epps sits down in the sand, all out of ideas.  There's a long
     quiet before Jaeger says:

                          JAEGER 
                What do you think our chances are? 

                          EPPS 
                If we can find the Hummer, or some 
                friendlies by sundown we might be okay. 
                We've got enough water for that.  But we
                won't make another day otherwise. 

     Again they sit for a beat.

                          JAEGER
                Wonder how the war's going? 

                          EPPS 
                It's got to be going better than this.. 

     Epps stands and has a last look around. 

                          EPPS{CONT) 
                All right.  pick a direction. 

     Jaeger just gives a surprised look. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                We can't just sit here.  We've got to
                start moving, so pick. 

                          JAEGER 
                You sure you want me too? 

     Epps nods.  Jaeger stands and takes a good look around.  He
     considers things, although there isn't much to consider.
     Finally he decisively points in a direction. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                I pick that way. 

                          EPPS 
                Okay.  Then we go this way. 

     Epps heads off in the opposite direction. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     Epps and Jaeger make the long march across the sand.  There's
     so much nothing out there it's maddening. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     Epps drops down in the sand.  He lets his pack slide fram his 
     back, then pulls his water and takes a healthy swig.  He puts
     his pack back on and struggles to his feet.  As Jaeger
     crosses he takes Epps by the shoulder and helps to pull him
     up.  The two wade on. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - EVENING 

     Epps and Jaeger are trekking as they have been doing all day. 
     They look worn out, but they keep moving.  Jaeger is several
     paces behind Epps. 

                          JAEGER
                Getting cold.

                          EPPS 
                It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at
                night; they get cold. 

                          JAEGER 
                Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a
                second. 

                          EPPS
                No! 

                          JAEGER 
                Just let me rest for a second. 

                          EPPS 
                We've got to keep moving while there's
                still light. 

                          JAEGER 
                You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just
                going to take a second.  I want to look
                at the gold. 

                          EPPS 
                Don't you touch it. 

                          JAEGER 
                I just want to look at it.  Remind me of
                what I'm dying for. 

                          EPPS 
                The deal was no one touches it until we
                get out of here. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was
                still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new
                deal. 

     Jaeger takes the pack from his back and starts to open it.
     Epps turns and races back to him grabbing him by the wrist
     and forcing Jaeger to let go of the pack. 

                          EPPS 
                You listen to me.  If, if we get out of
                this I don't care what you do with your 
                share, but until then you've only got one
                thing to think about and that's staying 
                alive.  So you leave that gold alone, or
                you and I are going to have to have a
                serious talk. 

     Epps waits for a response from Jaeger, but gets none. 

     Jaeger's eyes seem to be glazed, and his stare fixed on a
     point well beyond Epps.  He raises a hand, points off into 
     the distance. 

                          JAEGER
                Look. 

     Epps turns and looks.  Off a ways is a light in the window of
     what looks to be a shack-type building.  Epps stares at it as
     if it were the holy Grail 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                What do you figure it is? 

                          EPPS 
                Place all alone like that?  Must be a
                boarder check point. 

                          JAEGER 
                Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria? 

                          EPPS 
                Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone
                that far north.  It's got to be Saudi.
                Come on. 

     Epps heads for the shack doing double time.  Jaeger puts the
     pack back on and races to catch up. 

                          EPPS(CONT} 
                They've got to have water.  We'll get 
                same water, some directions, maybe they
                even have a vehicle. 

                          JAEGER
                Epps. 

                          EPPS 
                We can head back for our lines, and they
                don't even have to know about the gold. 

                          JAEGER 
                Epps.  What if they're not Saudi. 

     Epps stops dead, now not more than one hundred meters from
     the shack. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                If it's a checkpoint, it could be Iraqi. 

     Epps considers this.

                          EPPS 
                We've got no cboice.  Either way, we've
                got no choice. 

     Epps and Jaeger keep on for the shack walking with
     apprehension now instead of running.  Epps stops less than
     fifty meters away. 

                          JAEGER
                Well? 

                          EPPS 
                Well, we should identify ourselves. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, I guess we should. 

     Epps takes in a deep breath ready to yell to the shack.
     Instead he turns to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS 
                Even if they are Iraqis probably all
                they'll do is take us prisoner for
                awhile.  Got to figure we're still 
                kicking their asses in the war.  They
                don't want any trouble.

                          JAEGER 
                Hell, they'll probably just surrender to
                us.  Probably. 

     Again Epps takes a deep breath.  And again just as he's about 
     to cry out he turns to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS
                That's if the war is even still going on.
                Way things were shaping up it's probably
                long over. 

                          JAEGER
                Probably. 

     Epps takes a beat, then sucks in a breath.  He yells for the
     shack: 

                          EPPS
                Hellooooo-- 

     Before Epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun 
     fire erupts from the house and burns towards Epps and Jaeger.
     They dive for cover, hugging the ground as bullets whistle 
     and ping through the space around them.  They are forced back
     and down against a narrow stretch of rock, but it offers 
     little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead.  It's 
     just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them
     and death.  At the top of his lungs Jaeger starts yelling: 

                          JAEGER 
                Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib!  Ashra Ka
                mahari dahra sahib!

     Just as quickly as it began the shooting stops.  From the
     shack we hear some chatter in Arabic, then the door opens.  A
     few MEN appear in the doorway.  They laugh and beckon for
     Epps and Jaeger to join them. 

                          EPPS 
                What did you say? 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't know.  Something Wes had taught
                me.  I think it means "Don't shoot.
                We're your friends." 

                          EPPS 
                They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi 
                checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on.
                Come on! 

     Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.  Jaeger is
     just steps behind him. 

     They enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the FOUR
     men inside.  Epps and Jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and
     go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on
     chattering behind them. 

                          JAGER 
                Oh, man, this is good.  What do you think
                the chances are they've got a whirlpool
                in this place? 

     As they rub their hands together Epps looks up.  He freezes.
     Hanging on the wall is a very handsome, nicely framed 
     portrait of Saddam Hussein.  Epps nudges Jaeger who also
     looks up.  He also freezes. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Oh, God... 

                          EPPS 
                They must have thought we were Iraqi when
                you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell
                in the dark. 

                          JAEGER
                What are we going to do? 

     Epps thinks.  What are they going to do?

                          EPPS 
                Slip out your M-16. 

                          JAEGER
                And then what? 

                          EPPS 
                And then shoot them. 

                          JAEGER 
                I...I never killed anyone before.  I told
                you that. 

                          EPPS 
                Well, you're going to start with a bang,
                'cause you've got four of them to take down. 

     Behind Epps and Jaeger one of the Iraqis asks a question of
     them in Arabic. 

                          JAEGER 
                Can't you-- 

                          EPPS 
                I don't have a weapon. 

     Again the Iraqi asks the question.  We can tell by the tone
     of his voice he expects an answer. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going
                to kill me.  Kill them! 

                          JAEGER 
                I just said I would.  I don't think I-- 

                          EPPS
                Shoot them! 

     The Iraqis sense that something is wrong.  They move
     menacingly for their weapons. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Shoot them, Jaeger!  SHOOT THEM! 

     Jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his M-16.  He 
     jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth, back 
     and forth. 

     Dig it:  The Iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of 
     the muzzle flashes.  They do the twist, they do the jerk,
     then they all fall down. 

     The bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the
     place; shredding walls, eating up wood. 

     Jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty.  He stands 
     huffing, eyes glazed like he's a million miles away from what
     he just did.  Epps steps up and takes the weapon from Jaeger.
     That's like an alarm clock that brings Jaeger back to the 
     land of the living.  Jaeger takes one look around at all the
     carnage, then doubles over and gets to puking. 

     Epps just watches this pathetic sight.  When Jaeger is all
     done: 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Let's get some sleep. 

                                                           FADE TO: 

     BLACK 

                                                           FADE TO:

     INT. SHACK - MORNING 

     The sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as 
     Jaeger comes awake.  The second he does he sees a MAN - Arab,
     wearing white robes - peering through the window.  Jaeger 
     gives a start, and the man disappears.  Jaeger quickly shakes
     Epps awake. 

                          JAEGER 
                Epp...Epps!  There's someone at the
                window!

     This wakes Epps up quick. 

                          EPPS
                An Iraqi? 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform 
                on.  He...he had on white robes, like the
                guys who killed Wes.

     Epps does some quick figuring, then staying low, scrambles
     across the floor to one of the dead Iraqis and grabs up his
     weapon.  He grabs another one tosses it to Jaeger.

     Carefully, still low, Epps creeps over to the window.  Slowly
     he raises up and looks out. 

                          JAGER(CONT)
                See anything? 

                          EPPS
                Nothing. 

     Epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking. 

                          JAEGER
                What do we do? 

                          EPPS 
                We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't
                an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of
                time before some show up.  Get all the 
                water you can carry, and we'll head out
                on foot. 


                          JAEGER 
                To where? 

                          EPPS 
                Sun rises in the East.  We go the
                opposite direction.  May not find 
                anything, but at least we'll know we're
                heading towards Saudi Arabia. 

     As Jaeger gathers up what water he can find, creeps for
     the door.  With the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a
     crack and peers out.  Still nothing.  It's like the man
     vanished into thin air. 

     Jaeger, stocked up on water, comes over with the gold and
     Epps' pack which Epps shoulders.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Ready? 

     Jaeger nods.  Epps opens the door, and the two men carefully
     snake their way out weapons at the ready.  It seems, though,
     there is nothing to be ready for.  There is no one around. 

     Suddenly the man appears from around the shack.  Epps and
     Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but
     they do not fire.  The man just stands.  He doesn't say
     anything, he makes no threatening moves.  The three stay 
     still as statues for several beats until Epps jerks his head
     indicating to Jaeger they should move on.  That they do,
     weapons still on the man, until they are beyond his range.

     They walk on a little ways.  Jaeger spots something, and
     thrusts a finger in its direction.

                          JAEGER
                Look! 

     Mounted on a horse, riding on a dune that runs parallel to
     them, is ANOTHER ARAB MAN.  He makes no effort to draw nearer
     to Epps and Jaeger, but nor does he lose them.

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                What do we do? 

                          EPPS 
                We keep going, that's what we do.  We
                ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

     As if to be contrary to Epps' statement ANOTHER TWO ARABS ON
     HORSE BACK appear up over a dune before them.

                          JAEGER
                Jesus!  How many of them are there? 

     Epps doesn't know, and he doesn't want to find out.  They 
     change direction heading away from the Arabs.  But again MORE
     ARABS ride up over a dune.  Epps gets the feeling he and
     Jaeger are about to be boxed in. 

                          EPPS 
                I don't like this.  Let's go. 

     Epps breaks into a run.  Jaeger is only steps behind him. 

     Like something out of an old John Ford western dozens of 
     mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune.  They ride fast 
     and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon
     train.  They easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing
     them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if
     playing with them. 

     Epps and Jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction.  The
     Arabs ride back, again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to
     the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over
     them.  It looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the
     cattle. 

     Epps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again
     the Arabs bear down on them.  This time they mean business.
     They completely surround them, cutting off all means of 
     escape.  The Arabs start screaming something back and forth
     in Arabic.  We don't know what, but it sounds unpleasant. 

     Epps and Jaeger come skidding to a halt.  They turn in their
     tracks digging in the scene.  It goes like this:  They are
     completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force.
     Doesn't get any simpler. 

     Epps and Jaeger drop their weapons.  Their hands go in the
     air. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. SHI'ITE CAMP - LATER 

     The mounted Arabs lead Epps and Jaeger, hands tied before 
     them and almost literally being towed by the horses, into 
     their camp.  It is similar to the Shi'ite camps we've seen
     before with several tent dwellings. 

     As the party enters groups of Shi'ites come over to stare at
     Epps and Jaeger.  They chatter amongst themselves, but our 
     boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just
     makes things all the scarier.

     From our boy's point of view this is all like an unending
     nightmare:  Being dragged along through a desert, not knowing
     the language, not knowing what's going to happen.  Their 
     world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt-a-whirl. 

     Finally they reach a tent.  One of the Arabs tosses Epps and
     Jaeger's packs on the ground just before it.  Another cuts
     them loose and SHOVES THEM INSIDE THE TENT, then yells 
     something at them in Arabic.  He leaves, and our two are
     alone. 

                          JAEGER 
                What do you make of them? 

                          EPPS 
                Shi'ites, I think. 

                          JAEGER 
                Is that good, or bad? 

                          EPPS 
                I don't know.  They killed Wes. 

                          JAEGER 
                Why haven't they killed us!? 

                          EPPS
                I don't know! 

                          JAEGER 
                ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way
                out. 

                          EPPS 
                With what?  Against how many? 

                          JAEGER 
                We can't just sit here waiting to die. 

                          EPPS 
                You come up with a better plan, let me
                know. 

                          JAEGER 
                Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold.
                If we gave it to them they might let us
                live; they might not kill us. 

     From O.C. we hear a voice:

                          VOICE(O.C.)
                I always knew you were a bitch.

     Epps and Jaeger's hearts seize up and stop.  It's as if
     they've heard the voice of a ghost, and they have.  IT'S WES!
     He carries with him the pack of gold.  Epps can barely get
     his name out.

                          EPPS
                ...Wes...?

                          JAEGER
                You were shot.  We were standing right
                there, you were shot!

                          WES
                In the flack jacket.  Still like getting
                hit in the back with a baseball bat.
                Took the air right out of me, but I was
                just unconscious for awhile.  'Course,
                you didn't stick around to find that out.
                You left me for dead.

                          EPPS
                We thought--

     Like a guy who just took two steps over the edge:

                          WES
                YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD!

     Ohhh, shit.  Somebody's crazy.  Epps gets the feeling there's
     not going to be much dialog going on here.  Wes gets real
     calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts.

                          WES(CONT)
                When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had
                shot an American they were very
                apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking
                ass in this little war.  They figure
                we've finally gotten Saddam off their
                backs.  They brought me to their camp,
                cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new
                best buddy.  America number one, Joe.
                But there's something the Shi'ites can't
                figure out:  They can't figure out why my
                two buddies, two fellow Americans, left
                me out in the desert.  They can't seem to
                figure out what those same two guys were
                doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost
                as if they were Iraqi spies, or
                something.  And I've got to tell you they
                hate anything that's got to do with the
                Iraqis.  See how I mean?

                          JAEGER 
                We had to take shelter in the checkpoint.
                Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there. 

                          WES 
                You actually got around to killing 
                someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're
                only half a bitch. 

                          EPPS 
                Wes, we thought you were dead, and we 
                thought we were next.  Hanging around to
                get killed wouldn't have done anyone any
                good. 

                          WES 
                Sure, and I guess it was just convenient
                there was one less person to split the
                gold with. 

                          EPPS
                Wes-- 

                          WES 
                Look, I know you guys are telling the 
                truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know
                that.  I guess you could tell them...but 
                then you don't speak the language do you?

     Wes gets right up into Jaeger's face. 

                          WES{CONT)
                Do you!? 

     Of course Wes knows they don't.  He allows himself a very
     sweet, shit eating grin. 

                          WES{CONT) 
                They're going to kill you slow.  I'll see
                to that. 

     He steps away and starts to open the pack of gold. 

                          WES(CONT) 
                Thanks for taking care of this for me.

                          EPPS 
                Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy,
                greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says
                you're crazy. 

                          JAEGER 
                I didn't say that.  I never said-- 

                          EPPS 
                Me?  I say you don't have enough brains
                to be stupid. 

     For a second Wes is taken by surprise by the statement, but
     he smiles at Epps' boldness.  He sets down the pack of gold
     and gets right up into Epps' face. 

                          WES 
                You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured
                you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I
                had respect for you. 

                          EPPS 
                That why you tried to put a bullet in my
                head in the middle of the desert.

                          WES 
                That's just what things came to. 
                Sometimes you can't help that.  It 
                doesn't change me respecting you.  And
                now you let me down.  I expected more
                from you, you know?  I really did.  I 
                expected you to-- 

     A KNIFE SLIDES UP INTO FRAME UNTIL THE THE TIP RESTS JUST
     UNDER WES' THROAT, CHOKING OFF HIS WORDS. 

     Now it's Epps' turn to go smug. 

                          EPPS 
                You expect this? 

     Wes' got nothing to say.  To Jaeger:

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Get the gold! 

     Jaeger grabs up the pack. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                     (To Wes) 
                Now let's try things another way.  Let's
                try this:  You and me and Jaeger are
                going to walk out of here.  We're going
                to walk out all smiling and friendly so 
                your little Shi'ite buddies won't suspect
                a thing.  Then we're going to hop on some
                horses, and ride away, and live happily 
                ever after.  It's all going to happen
                just like that, because if it doesn't 
                then I'm going to gut you like a fat pig.
                You understand me...soldier? 

     Wes says nothing.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                I'll take that as a yes. 

     Epps gruffly spins Wes around and presses the knife up
     against his back so that it is hidden. 

     EPPS MARCHES WES OUTSIDE THE TENT, stopping momentarily to
     grab up his pack with his free hand.  To Jaeger he says: 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Get the water.

     Jaeger does as he's told. 

                          WES 
                They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten
                feet before they cut you down. 

                          EPPS 
                You don't know John Epps very well, do
                you?

                          JAEGER 
                Can you ride a horse? 

                          EPPS 
                No, but I figure now's a real good time
                to start. 

     They walk on through the camp towards some saddled horses.
     They pass a Shi'ite who says something to Wes in Arabic.
     Epps gives Wes a poke in the back with the knife. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Don't say anything. 

     The Shi'ite, obviously expecting an answer, says whatever it
     was he said again. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Just keep quiet. 

                          WES 
                I have to answer him.

                          EPPS
                So you can give us away? 

                          WES 
                If I don't answer, he'll know something's
                up.

     Epps gives this a lot of thought in a very short time.

                          EPPS 
                You answer him, but you answer him wrong
                and you're going to be staring at your
                insides while you're dying. 

     Wes very calmly says something to the Shi'ite.  The Shi'ite 
     just stands there for a beat looking at the three men, then
     suddenly explodes in screams.  No way of knowing for sure
     what he's saying, but since he's going off like a Westec
     alarm it's a pretty good bet he's been tipped of.

     Epps rears back a fist and slams it into Wes' face.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Bastard! 

     Epps and Jaeger take off running for the horses, practically
     leaping into the saddles as Shi'ites come pouring out of 
     their tents.  Forgetting himself, Wes screams in English. 

                          WES
                Stop them! 

     Jaeger and Epps spur their horses and take off riding hard.
     It's amazing what you can do when a bunch of angry Shi'ites
     are chasing you.

     Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shi'ite and mounts
     up with blood in his eyes.  He leads a charge of armed, 
     mounted Shi'ites that looks like a posse going after some bad
     men. 

     Out front Epps and Jaeger pull up for a second.

                          JAEGER
                They coming? 

     Epps takes a look behind him.  He can't hardly miss the
     sandstorm Wes and the Shi'ites kick up as they ride for them. 

                          EPPS 
                Oh, yeah.  They're coming. 

     Epps points off to some foothills in the distance.  It's the
     only thing close to cover for miles around.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Ride for the hills.  We'll try to lose 
                them.

     They take the reigns to their horses and get to riding.

     Behind them Wes yells to his riders, and signals for them to
     split up, and try to cut off Epps and Jaeger.

     Epps and Jaeger hit the hills.  They ride up for a bit, then
     stop to spot Wes.  Wes and his crew are better riders and 
     have closed the gap.  All the two can do now is try to lose
     them in the terrain.

     Epps and Jaeger ride as best they can, and somewhat 
     erratically to cover their trail.  They head up a ways, then
     cut across in a parallel direction.  Jaeger looks back, but
     sees no sign of Wes. 

                          JAEGER
                We lost them! 

     Just as the words leave Jaeger's mouth a hail of bullets 
     explodes the ground before them.  Their horses rear up, and
     it's all they can do to fight them.  Just ahead are the
     Shi'ites who split off from Wes, having circled around Epps
     and Jaeger. 

     The two yank their horses back, and ride hard in the opposite
     direction with the Shi'ites just behind.  They fire on Epps
     and Jaeger, the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them. 

     Epps and Jaeger are little more than passengers on their
     horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs.  And good
     for it, too, otherwise they might be dead by now.  They break
     for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it
     does little to shake loose their pursuers. 

     As Epps and Jaeger level out they can see the trail below
     them, and Wes and his posse riding for them.  Our two start
     back the way they came. but the other Shi'ites crest the
     hill.

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Which way? 

     Epps looks from side to side.  Either way is certain death.
     Then he looks off towards an embankment.  It is VERY steep.
     VERY treacherous. 

     It would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment 
     safely.  All Epps knows is there aren't any gun totting
     Shi'ites in that direction. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Which way do we go!? 

                          EPPS
                We go this way. 

     Fear gives way to desperation.  Both men whip their steeds
     hard.  The beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild
     ride down.  Both Epps and Jaeger have to lean back in their
     saddles until they're almost parallel to the ground just to
     stay on their horses. 

     Wes sees this and swears.  He signals to his men to cut back
     the other way. 

     Epps reaches the bottom of the embankment.  Jaeger is almost
     there when he looses control of his horse.  Both rider and
     animal go tumbling in an ugly fall. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Jaeger!

     The horse gets up and bolts off before Jaeger can get to her. 

     Just then Wes and his men make it back down the trail, and
     start riding hard for Jaeger.

     Epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen
     comrade.  As he rides in he leans to the side and low.
     Stretching out an arm Epps literally scoops Jaeger, and
     swings him up behind him.  A couple of rodeo performers
     couldn't have done it better. 

     Problem is with the extra weight they can't go very fast.
     Wes and his men close hard now.  The bullets fly fast and
     furious swarming all around our boys.

     Epps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to
      give.  This is it:  They get away now, or not at all.  Their
     horse finds a little something extra.  She goes faster,
     faster...

     Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.  The horse rears
     up, she goes wild.  It takes everything Epps has to control
     her.  But better that than if she'd taken another stride.
     They've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff.  Epps
     may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get
     this beast to fly. 

     Finally he calms the horse down, but it doesn't matter.  Wes
     and the Shi'ites ride up behind them cutting them off.  Wes
     stands down from his horse.

     Epps and Jaeger, with nowhere to go, do the same. 

                          WES
                The gold; give it to me.

     Epps takes the pack from Jaeger, but doesn't throw it to Wes.

                          WES(CONT)
                Give it to me! 

                          EPPS 
                If I give it to you, will you let us go? 

     Wes smiles and lies so badly he doesn't even bother trying to
     fake it. 

                          WES 
                Sure.  Whatever you want.  For old time
                sake.

     Epps has got no choice, really.  He tosses the pack to Wes' 
     feet who stoops to pick it up.  Wes starts to open the pack.

                          WES(CONT)
                Looks like at the end of the day we 
                finally find out who's better than who, 
                don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected
                more from you. 

                          EPPS
                It's like I said; you don't really know
                lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? 

     Wes rips open the pack.  He's got about one second to see
     what's inside.  NO GOLD.  JUST A BOOBY TRAPPED CLAYMORE MINE.

     Epps grabs Jaeger and yanks to him to the ground. 

     There is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily
     destroys Wes and a few of the Shi'ite standing next to him.
     The rest, along with the horses, scatter for dear life.

     Epps stays down until the coast is clear, then gets up.
     Jaeger, to say the least, is stunned. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Damn it.  We lost the horses.

                          JAEGER
                The...the gold... 

                          EPPS 
                It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore
                mine.  The gold's in my pack.

                          JAEGER
                When did you make the switch?

                          EPPS 
                It's always been like that.  When you 
                left me down in the crevice to send the
                gold up I figured I'd better...take 
                precautions.  I rigged it to blow if 
                anyone opened the pack.  Just in case 
                somebody thought they could do better on
                their own. 

                          JAEGER
                But...

                          EPPS 
                We had a deal.  No one touches the gold
                until we're out of here.  No one breaks
                the deal, no one had anything to worry
                about.

                          JAEGER 
                What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I
                mean, accidently, what if I had... 

                          EPPS
                You shouldn't think about things like
                that.  It'll just make you crazy. 

     We hold on the two men, on the smoking remains of Wes.  We
     hold on them, then:

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT/ROAD - LATER 

     Epps and Jaeger come up to the road, a small highway.  It's 
     eerie; a road in the middle of the desert.  Quiet.  No cars.
     They just stand and stare at it for a beat.

                          JAEGER
                Well? 

                          EPPS 
                A car's got to come along sooner or
                later.  When it does, we jack it. 

                          JAEGER 
                How do we do that? 

                          EPPS 
                You lie in the middle of the road, look
                like you're hurt.  When the car stops I
                run over to the driver and put a gun to
                his head. 

                          JAEGER 
                Why do I have to lie in the road? 

                          EPPS 
                Somebody has to.

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, but why me?  What if the car
                doesn't stop? 

                          EPPS 
                Then I'm a rich man. 

     Epps sits by the side of the road waiting for a car.  The
     only thing he gets is more quiet.  Jaeger sits next to him.
     After a couple of beats: 

                          JAEGER
                Epps. 

                          EPPS
                Yeah. 

                          JAEGER 
                I want you to know... I don't know.  I
                just think you're a hell of a guy. 

                          EPPS
                Thanks. 

                          JAEGER 
                This whole time, you've kept your head.
                You didn't go money simple like me and 
                Wes.  You've just been trying to figure
                how to get us out of here.  And you've
                been fair too.  I mean, even after 
                I...you know... 

                          EPPS 
                Threatened to blow my brains out? 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take
                it out on me, except for maybe making me
                lie in the middle of the road now.  But
                I'd say you've been very fair.  I just 
                think it's a hell of a man who can keep
                from going money simple. 

                          EPPS 
                Don't make so much out of it.  Only
                reason I haven't figured a way to get all
                that money for myself is because I've
                been too busy figuring ways to stay 
                alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to
                catch my breath I might have played 
                things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no 
                better than anybody else.  I've just been
                busier. 

     They sit a while more.  Still no car.

                          JAEGER
                Epps? 

                          EPPS
                What? 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm thinking about taking a trip. 

                          EPPS 
                Thought you were going to buy a car. 

                          JAEGER
                Still am.  There's more gold than I 
                thought, and since there's only two of us
                now...  Where should I go? 

                          EPPS
                I don't know. 

                          JAEGER 
                I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't 
                know where to go.  Where would you go? 

                          EPPS 
                How the hell should I know? 

     Another long beat.  Still no car.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Australia. 

                          JAEGER 
                What?

                          EPPS
                I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not 
                many people.  I think after this I'd like
                to quit people for awhile.  And the girls
                go crazy for brothers down there.

                          JAEGER
                Really? 

                          EPPS 
                That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls
                go crazy everywhere for a man with gold. 

     From the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor.  It
     draws closer and closer. 

     Epps and Jaeger stand.  Knowing they're so close to the end
     of a long adventure they become very business like.

                          JAEGER 
                Well, this is it.  We get the car, find 
                some Americans.  We find Americans we'll
                be all right. 

                          EPPS 
                We'll make up some kind of lie.  They
                won't find the gold. 

     Epps and Jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car
     draws closer. 

                          JAEGER
                Okay.  See you in a minute.

     Jaeger goes out and lays in the car's path.  Epps goes to
     hide behind some rocks.

     The car keeps getting closer and closer.

     Jaeger yells over to Epps. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Epps, I don't think he's slowing down. 

                          EPPS 
                He'll slow down.

     The car gets closer. 

                          JAEGER
                He's not slowing. 

                          EPPS 
                He's going to slow down. 

     The car gets closer. 

                          JAEGER
                Epps...Epps! 

     The car barrels right for Jaeger.  Forget what Epps says,
     it's not slowing down and Jaeger knows it.

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Aw, damn!

     At the last possible second Jaeger rolls out of the way.  The
     car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where
     Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him.  The DRIVER loses 
     control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt.

     Epps runs to the car, rips open the driver's door, and
     presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head.

                          EPPS 
                You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK
                ENGLISH!? 

                          DRIVER
                     (Frightened) 
                Y-yes. 

     Jaeger runs over and jumps in the car.  Epps gets in behind
     the driver, keeping the gun pressed to his head.

                          EPPS 
                Where were you going? 

                          DRIVER
                Baghdad. 

                          EPPS 
                What's in the other direction? 

                          DRIVER
                This road, it leads straight to Kuwait. 

                          EPPS 
                Turn the car around.

                          DRIVER 
                Please, I beg of you.  The American army
                is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill
                me. 

                          EPPS 
                Nobody's going to hurt you.

     Epps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You see that?  Gold.  You take us to the
                Americans, and we'll give you another
                one.  Now drive. 

     The driver turns around the car and starts back in the
     direction he came. 

     They drive on for awhile, mostly in silence.  Epps and Jaeger
     are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the
     driver is too scared.  Finally the driver starts to talk. 

                          DRIVER
                You are Americans, yes? 

     Neither Jaeger or Epps answer. 

                          DRIVER(CONT)
                We didn't not all want this war, do you
                know?  We didn't not all want to invade 
                our brothers and sisters in Kuwait.  Now
                your army crushes us.  So few days, and 
                so many have died.  And many fear we will
                all die.  Please tell this to your
                people:  We did not want this war.

     Still Jaeger and Epps say nothing.  Outside the car the 
     traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets
     thicker and thicker.

                          DRIVER(CONT)
                I have a brother in our army.  When I 
                take you back, will you look for him?  If
                he is still alive, will you look for him
                and take care of him? 

     This last bit gets to Epps.

                          EPPS 
                Yeah.  We'll look for him.

     Outside the traffic away from Kuwait has gotten so thick 
     everything is at a stand still.  There are Iraqi military
     vehicles pulling out, as well as a good many civilian cars
     and trucks.  It clogs up both lanes, and envelopes the car.
     Some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much
     faster.

                          JAEGER
                Look at this.

                          DRIVER 
                Iraqis.  They are fleeing from Kuwait,
                from your military.

                          EPPS 
                See if you can't drive around this.

     The driver tries to work the car free of the congestion, but
     he's wedged in, and not going anywhere.

     From out of the sky swoop down a flight of AMERICAN F-15E
     FIGHTER JETS.  They swing down on the far end of the highway,
     engines roaring like angry lions.  For a second time stands
     still.  Everyone on the road stops and looks up at the jets.

     Time starts again, and with a deadly vengeance.

     The fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway:  Vehicles and
     people, civilian and military alike.  There is no
     distinction, only carnage.

     This is the infamous Al Jahra highway from Basrah to Kuwait
     City that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on
     the last day of the war by American forces.  It became known
     as the Highway of Death. 

     The huge shells rip a bloody path, shredding cars and trucks,
     igniting explosions, straight towards the car with Epps,
     Jaeger and the driver.  With barely seconds to go before they
     are shot to pieces as well.  They dive from the car, Epps
     dragging the driver out, and scramble for cover along the
     side of the road. 

     The planes turn back for another pass.

                          JAEGER 
                What the hell are they doing?  There're 
                civilians in there.

     Not even thinking about what he's doing Jaeger jumps up and
     screams at the jets.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                DON'T SHOOT!  DON'T SHOOT!  THEY'RE
                CIVILIANS! 

     Epps jumps up and drags Jaeger back down to cover as the
     shells fram the jets cut dangerously close to them. 

     The jets bank and swoop for another run.

     Epps realizes there is something wrong.  He looks around
     desperately, but doesn't see...THERE, BACK IN THE CAR! 

                          EPPS
                The gold! 

     Epps runs for the car, trying to beat the jets.

                          JAEGER
                No!

     Jaeger lunges for Epps but misses him.  Epps snakes his way
     through the burning hulks towards their car.  He dodges,
     jukes and weaves among shells, shrapnel and explosions that 
     go off all around him.  He just makes it to the car, grabbing
     up the gold, as the fighters once again swing low and cut
     loose. 

     A wicked hail of shells reigns down.  It sets off a series of
     violent explosions that knocks Jaeger off his feet.  It takes
     him a beat to recover.  By then the fighters have done their
     job, and fly off. 

     Jaeger stands.  He walks towards the road over the plaintive
     wails of the barely living.  The car, the gold, Epps... they
     are essentially disintegrated.

     AS THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP WE SEE THAT IT ISN'T JUST
     THEIR CAR AND EPPS THAT ARE GONE.  There isn't much of 
     anything left on this road.  Just death, destruction and
     bloodshed.

     INT. MILITARY COURTROOM - MONTHS LATER 

     Jaeger is cleaned up, in dress uniform, and sitting at a 
     table before a MILITARY TRIBUNAL.  He looks very sullen, as
     if this whole adventure has robbed him of his soul. 

     The members of the tribunal just look pissed. 

                          CHIEF JUSTICE 
                The members of this tribunal have reached
                a verdict.  Based on the evidence 
                presented we find the defended guilty as
                charged of desertion, insurrection, 
                insubordination, and conduct unbecoming.
                Further the tribunal will recommend that
                the defendant be sentenced to life 
                imprisonment, and that from this day 
                forward he shall no longer walk as a free
                man.  You should consider yourself quite
                fortunate, son.  There was a time when 
                lesser crimes would have found you before
                a firing squad.  I don't know that a 
                person like you has much to say for
                himself, but it is your right say
                something. 

     Jager doesn't stand.  He doesn't look at the tribunal.  He
     just begins to talk. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm sorry, I guess.  Not for looking for
                the gold, or leaving my post.  You know
                what it's like to have gold raining out 
                of your hands?  That'll give me enough to
                think about the rest of my days in the 
                brig.  I'm just sorry about Wes.  He was
                all right.  It was the gold that made him
                what he became.  If I hadn't found that
                map, if I hadn't talked them into going 
                searching...Wes just might have made it
                home after all.  I guess I feel
                responsible for him. 

                          CHIEF JUSTICE
                The way I view things you're responsible
                for the lives of two men:  Private First 
                Class Wes Hanmond, and Second Lieutenant 
                John Epps. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, well, I've been thinking about 
                that.  See, there was an explosion and 
                everything, but I never really aaw Epps 
                get killed.  And nobody ever found the
                gold.  I guess they both could have been 
                burned to slag.  I guess.  But there were
                a lot of bodies out on that road.  A
                smart man could have found some 
                identification to use.  A smart man could
                have made his way up to Syria or Turkey.
                A smart man could have gotten himself
                right out of the Middle East.  A smart
                man with enough gold.  Way I figure, 
                right about now old Epps is sitting in a
                bar in Sydney, or Melboure, or maybe 
                Brisbane telling stories to one of the
                prettiest Aussies you ever saw. 

     The members of the tribunal just scoff.

                          CHIEF JUSTICE 
                I find it highly unlikely that anyone
                could accomplish such a thing.

                          JAEGER 
                Well, Sir, I guess you don't know Second 
                Lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? 

     Jaeger allows himself a slight smile as he leaves the
     tribunal with this question.

     EXT. DESERT - DAY
     
     From a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle
     of a huge, empty desert.  Just the Humvee, nothing else for
     miles.  We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like
     noises.
     
                          JAEGER (V.O.)
                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

     CU - HUMVEE
     
     There are three soldiers at the Humvee.  Second Lieutenant
     JOHN EPPS,                   who sweeps the horizon with a
     pair of binoculars.  PFC WES HAMMOND, who is behind the wheel
     looking very bored, and PFC MARK JAEGER, who is at the
     Humvee's thirty caliber machine gun, making the noises and
     shooting at phantom troops.  When Jaeger talks it's with all
     the swagger of a B-movie hero.

                          JAEGER
                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

                          EPPS
                What are you doing?

                          JAEGER 
                What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm 
                killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- 
                at-at-- 

                          WES 
                Could you stop, please.  You're giving me
                a headache. 

                          JAEGER
                A headache? 

                          WES 
                Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're
                making me uncomfortable. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking 
                away in a desert in the middle of nowhere
                facing three-hundred-thousand screaming 
                Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that
                doesn't bother you.  But me making a 
                little noise is driving you out of your
                skull. 

                          WES 
                Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes. 

                          JAEGER
                Okay. 

     Jaeger goes right back to playing soldier. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                At-at-at-at-at. 

                          EPPS
                Knock it off! 

                          JAEGER 
                Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I 
                want to be ready when this war starts.

                          EPPS 
                Ready for what?  What are you supposed to
                be doing? 

                          JAEGER
                I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. 

                          EPPS
                No you're not. 

     Epps points in the opposite direction that Jaeger was 
     'firing.'

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                The Iraqis are that way.  Those are our
                troops you're shooting at. 

     With his binoculars Epps looks in the direction Jaeger was
     shooting. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You know what?  I think you got 
                Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the 
                General right in the ass.  Now that's
                good shooting. 

                          JAEGER
                Blow me. 

                          EPPS 
                Another month in this desert and I might
                just. 

                          WES 
                Think we're going to do it?  Think we're
                going to war? 

                          EPPS 
                Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All
                they have to do is get out of Kuwait. 

                          JAEGER 
                We ought to kick their asses anyway.
                Even if they do get out of Kuwait we
                ought to kick their asses. 

                          WES 
                I don't think we'll go to war.  We 
                shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our
                fight, it's a regional conflict.  It
                should be decided regionally. 

                          JAEGER 
                People are suffering. 

                          WES
                People were suffering in Afganistan, and
                we didn't do anything.

                          EPPS 
                That's 'cause the Afganis weren't smart
                enough to be sitting on top of oil. 
                People suffering is one thing, but when
                the Yuppies aren't going to have enough 
                gas for their BMWs it's time to break out
                the tanks.  Come on.  Pack up.  We've got
                a whole lot of nothing to patrol. 

     As they pack up and get ready to roll on Jaeger says almost
     to himself:

                          JAEGER 
                We ought to kick their asses.  Either way
                we ought to.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET BAZAAR - EVENING 

     The bazaar is loud and colorful, a cacophony of Arabic fills 
     the air.  The bazaar is filled with vendors actively selling
     their wares to each passerby, literally shoving them in the
     faces of prospective customers. 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger walk along side by side looking almost
     like the Three Musketeers, except that Wes is droning on. 

                          WES 
                ...And it's very important when you sit
                down never to point the soles of your
                shoes at anyone.  It's considered
                offensive. 

                          EPPS 
                You know so much about the Middle East,
                you know where we can get something to
                eat. 

                          JAEGER 
                When do you ever point the soles of your
                feet at people? 

                          WES 
                I'm saying don't do it accidently. 

                          JAEGER 
                Oh yeah.  Accidently. 

     Jaeger lifts his leg and purposefully points the bottom of
     his foot at a vendor. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I'm sorry.  My foot accidently jumped up 
                in the air where you could see the bottom
                of it.  I hate it when that happens.

     (Wes slaps Jaeger's leg down.) 

                          WES 
                Come on.  You're going to get us in
                trouble. 

                          JAEGER 
                It was an accident.  You saw it was an
                accident. 

                          WES 
                I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It
                doesn't hurt to know something about
                Saudi Arabia.

                          EPPS 
                Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn
                Arabic you might as well learn were we
                can get something to eat around here. 

                          WES 
                I didn't learn Arabic because we were 
                getting shipped here.  You don't learn it
                in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in
                high school. 

                          JAEGER
                Spanish wasn't hard enough? 

                          WES 
                I thought it would be good to know. 

                          JAGER 
                Yeah, if you ever need to buy a rug. 

                          WES 
                Hey, Jaeger.  Why don't you try this:
                Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib.

                          JAEGER 
                What does that mean? 

                          WES 
                Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can
                use that when you surrender.

                          JAEGER 
                How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm
                horny."  I can use that now. 

                          WES 
                Don't even try it.  You offend a woman
                out here you're in serious trouble.

                          EPPS 
                Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his
                personality as a form of birth control. 

                          JAEGER 
                Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys
                recently?  Blow me. 

     As Epps and Wes walk on Jaeger notices something on a 
     VENDOR'S table.  It is a small, square box - slightly larger
     than a man's palm - fashioned of wood and metal.  It is not
     particularly ornate, but eye catching in its own way.  The
     instant Jaeger picks it up and begins to look it over the
     Vendor is giving him the hard sell in Arabic.  Jaeger holds
     the box up to the vendor. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                What is this? 

     All he gets is more Arabic.  Jaeger calls over to Wes. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Hey, Wes.  Wes! 

     Wes comes back over to Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                What is this? 

                          WES 
                Now you need me.

                          JAEGER 
                What is it?  You know so much about
                Arabland tell me what it is. 

     Wes looks over the box carefully. 

                          WES 
                Well, based on my knowledge of the 
                region, its culture and her people I
                would have to say it's a box. 

                          EPPS 
                Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I
                really don't care what it is. 

                          JAEGER 
                Ask him what it is.

     Wes says something to the vendor in Arabic.  The Vendor
     answers back. 

                          WES 
                He says it's a box. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, you're funny. 

                          WES 
                It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out
                how to open it there's supposed to be a
                treasure inside.

                          JAEGER
                     (Excited)
                For real?  A treasure? 

                          EPPS 
                Oh, man, you're not going to fall for
                that. 

                          JAEGER 
                There might be something in there. 

                          EPPS 
                Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge. 

                          JAEGER
                There might be. 

                          WES 
                And you're the guy who's going to open 
                it.

                          JAEGER
                I could. 

                          EPPS 
                You could turn on a light if someone put 
                your hand on the switch. 

     Decisively, without even haggling about price, Jaeger whips
     out some money and pays the vendor for the box.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Well, that showed me.  Now, can we eat? 

     The three men walk on, Jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 

     It's filled with young soldiers messing around, playing 
     cards, listening to music, whatever.  Jaeger lays on a bunk
     holding the puzzle box, probing it with his fingers, trying
     to find a way to make it open. 

     Wes crosses over. 

                          WES 
                You get it yet? 

                          JAEGER 
                Naw, nothing. 

                          WES 
                You will.  You'll get it. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I
                get this thing open. 

                          WES 
                You really think there's a treasure
                inside? 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't care if there's a lump of coal in
                here.  I just want to be able to rub 
                Epps' face in it when I crack this thing. 

     Wes watches Jaeger work the box for a beat.

                          WES
                Jaeger? 

                          JAEGER
                What? 

                          WES 
                You know the fifteenth is the deadline
                for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  So? 

                          WES 
                That's in two days.

                          JAEGER
                Like I said; so?

                          WES 
                They're cancelling all leaves, all 
                passes.  No more drills.  We stand at
                full ready starting-- 

                          JAEGER 
                What's your point, Wes?  You have a
                point? 

                          WES 
                We're going to war, aren't we.  If 
                they're doing all that it must mean we're
                going to war. 

                          JAEGER 
                It doesn't mean anything. 

                          WES 
                Why would they do all that if we weren't? 

     Jaeger, frustrated, finally looks up from his box. 

                          JAEGER 
                Okay, so we're going to war.  We're 
                supposed to go to war.  We're soldiers, 
                that's what we do.  The guns, the tanks,
                the planes; you're just now getting the
                hint we're in the war business? 

     Jaeger goes back to his box.  Wes stands over him for a beat
     longer, then: 

                          WES
                Jaeger? 

                          JAEGER 
                     (For sure aggravated)
                What!?

                          WES 
                You ever think about dying? 

                          JAEGER 
                Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open. 

                          WES 
                You ever think about it?  You ever worry? 

                          JAEGER 
                The only thing I worry about is how much
                Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick
                before this whole thing is over.  The 
                only people who I've got anything to worry
                about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys 
                who don't know enough to get out of the 
                way when I come rolling at them; an M-16
                in each hand, and a grenade between my 
                teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier,
                I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got
                a treasure to find. 

     Wes lingers over Jaeger for a few more beats, then walks off as we:

                Just two hours ago, Allied air forces 
                began an attack on military targets in
                Iraq and Kuwait.  These attacks continue
                as I speak...Our objectives are clear. 
                Saddam Hussein's forces will leave
                Kuwait.  The legitimate government of
                Kuwait will be restored to its rightful
                place, and Kuwait will once again be

     EXT. DESERT - DAY 

     From a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle
     of a huge, empty desert.  Just the Humvee, nothing else for
     miles.  We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like
     noises. 

                          JAEGER(V.O.)
                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

     CU - HUMVEE 

     It's like the opening scene all over again.  Jaeger is at the
     machine gun, Epps sweeps the horizon with his binoculars, and
     Wes is behind the wheel.  Only difference is that Wes watches
     CNN footage of the air war on a Watchman. 

                          JAEGER
                At-at-at-at-at. 

                          WES 
                     (Re:  His TV) 
                This is so weird.  It's happening, but 
                it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're
                part of it. 

                          JAEGER
                At-at-at-at-at. 

                          EPPS 
                Will you knock it off!  Damn, man. 
                You're going to annoy the Iraqis into
                submission. 

     Jaeger gets down from the machine gun, pulls out his puzzle
     box and starts to work on it again. 

                          JAEGER 
                This is stupid.  It's going on a month 
                now.  How long are they going to let the
                Air Force piss on those bastards?  They 
                can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't
                going anywhere without a ground assault.
                What the hell is the army waiting for? 

                          EPPS 
                Why you in such a hurry to get to
                shooting? 

                          JAEGER 
                I've got to have something to tell people
                when I get home besides I protected a 
                stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for
                nothing in the first place. 

                          WES 
                The longer the air force hits the Iraqis,
                the safer it'II be for us when we have to
                engage. 

                          JAEGER 
                You know what, Wes?  If you get a note
                from your mommy they might excuse you
                from the war. 

                          EPPS 
                You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope
                the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my
                misery. 

                          JAEGER
                OH MY GOD! 

     Startled, Epps and Wes each pull their guns and spin in 
     Jaeger's direction expecting to have to fire at something. 

                          EPPS
                What!?  What!? 

                          JAEGER 
                I did it!  I got the box open. 

     Jaeger has indeed opened the box.  We can see something
     inside of it. 

                          EPPS 
                You almost got yourself shot, that's
                what you did. 

     Wes excitedly goes over to Jaeger. 

                          WES 
                What's inside? 

     Jaeger pulls out a small tube sealed with wax.

                          JAEGER 
                It's...it's...I don't know what it is. 

                          WES 
                It's a container.  Break the seal. 

     Jaeger hesitates a beat, which heightens a bit of suspense.
     All three men can't help but be drawn closer to the container. 

                          EPPS
                Go on, man. 

     Jaeger pokes his finger through the wax and pulls it off the
     tube.  He sticks his finger back into the container and draws
     out a rolled up piece of paper. 

                          WES
                Paper. 

                          EPPS 
                It's a fortune box. 

     Jaeger unrolls it.

                          WES
                What's it say?

                          EPPS 
                Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle
                box factory. 

     We see the paper.  Lines are drawn on it, large, crude 
     figures.  It's hard to make out exactly what it all is
     supposed to represent. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's a drawing, or something.  Some kind
                of art. 

     Epps takes the paper from Jaeger and gives it a once over. 

                          EPPS 
                Looks like something a kid would do. 

     Wes takes the paper and looks it over.

                          WES 
                It's a map, I think that's what it is.

                          EPPS 
                There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the
                buried treasure, and you're a
                millionaire. 

     Jaeger takes back the paper.  All excited like a kid on
     Christmas:

                          JAEGER
                You think? 

                          EPPS 
                Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You
                and the five thousand other suckers who
                bought those boxes.  Let's get out of
                here.  We got sand to protect. 

     Epps and Wes load up and get ready to move out.  Jaeger just
     keeps staring at the map, eyes lit like candles.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. INTELLIGENCE ROOM - LATER 

     The room is filled with maps, recon photos, HUMINT reports.
     They're posted on the walls with various levels of troop 
     strength - allied and Iraqi - indicated.  More data is 
     constantly flowing in, analyzed and processed. 

     Jaeger enters, spots WOODS - a young soldier on intel detail
     - and crosses over to him. 

                          JAEGER
                Woods. 

                          WOODS 
                Hey, Jaeger.  What's up. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of
                Iraqi. 

                          WOODS 
                A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna 
                have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally
                get out of here.  What kind of map you
                need?  Topographical, geographical,
                thermal?

                          JAGER
                I don't know.  A map map. 

                          WOODS
                A map map. 

     Woods pulls out a map and hands it to Jaeger.

                          WOODS(CONT)
                That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq
                is the pink thing. 

                          JAEGER 
                I could use some recon photos too. 

     Woods gives Jaeger a sideways glance.

                          WOODS 
                Planning on going to war all by your lonesome? 

                          JAEGER 
                Just...want to be ready when we do. 

                          WOODS 
                Ready for what?  Sight-seeing? 

                          JAEGER
                The photos. 

     Woods starts to dig for photos. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Some good ones. 

                          WOODS 
                They're all good ones.  Satellites we've
                got can snap a shot of the boil on
                Saddam's ass. 

                          JAEGER 
                Saddam's got a boil on his ass? 

     Woods looks up at Jaeger with an expression that says:
     "What?"

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                I don't know. 

     Woods goes back to looking, pulls some photos and hands them
     to Jaeger.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                Thanks, man.  Appreciate it. 

     Staring at the pictures like they held the secrets of the
     ages Jaeger starts to exit.  Woods mumbles after him: 

                          WOODS 
                Yeah.  You figure out how to win the war
                be sure to let us know. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. BARRACKS - LATER 

     Maps and photos cover Jaeger's bunk the way autumn leaves 
     cover the ground.  He swings between studying the maps, and
     reading from a book titled A History Of The Ottoman Empire.
     Jaeger puts the book down, then slides the drawing from the
     puzzle box up next to one of the recon photos.  He looks at
     the mosaic he's put together, looks at it like it was having
     a dialogue with him.  Dig it:  It is talking.  A voice only
     Jaeger can hear.  Right now it's just a little whisper, but
     the voice is getting louder. 

     A crossing SOLDIER, carrying a football, calls to Jaeger.

                          SOLDIER 
                Come on, Jaeger.  We're playing ball.

     Jaeger fairly jumps as he comes out of his trance. 

                          JAEGER 
                No that's okay.  I'm gonna...I'm doing some...

     The soldier crosses off.  Jaeger goes back to staring at his
     maps, and photos and drawings and books.  "What were you
     saying?"

     As it all keeps talking to him we:

     Once again President Bush delivers an address. 

                          BUSH 
                This evening, as I report to you, the
                military operation known as Desert Storm 
                enters its final phase.  The coalition
                forces that face the tyranny of Saddam 
                Hussein have launched an all out ground 
                offensive...as this last, and most 
                critical part of the campaign begins I 
                ask for your prayers that God may bless
                each and every one of the coalition 
                forces at our side in the Gulf, and that
                He may continue to bless our nation, the
                United States of America.

     EXT. DESSERT - DAY 

     From a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle
     of a huge, empty desert.  Just the Humvee, nothing else for
     miles.  We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like
     noises. 

                          JAEGER(V.O.) 
                At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

     CU - HUMVEE 

     It's our three boys again, just like we've seen them before:
     Jaeger at the machine gun, Epps working his binoculars, and
     Wes at the wheel watching his Watchman. 

     Jaeger jumps down from the machine gun pissed as all hell. 

                          JAEGER 
                They finally start the ground war, and
                where are we?  Same place we've been 
                since we got here.  Securing freedom for
                the dirt. 

                          EPPS 
                Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it
                this way:  At least you get to go home
                alive. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'd like to go home alive with a couple
                of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.

                          WES 
                Hey, look at this! 

     Jaeger and Epps come around to Wes' Watchman.  We see CNN
     footage of some Iraqi soldiers - looking very tired, hungry
     and scared - surrendering to a CNN news crew. 

                          WES{CONT) 
                They're surrendering to a news crew.  You
                believe that?

     Jaeger tosses his hands in the air in defeat. 

                          JAEGER 
                That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours
                into the war and it's over. 

                          WES 
                Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What
                kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?

                          EPPS
                A casual one.

                          WES 
                Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be
                home in no time. 

                          EPPS 
                Better grab up some sand to take home to
                your family.

     Jaeger bites at his lip.  He wants to say something, but 
     isn't quite sure how, if he should, if...  Fuck that, Jaeger.
     Just say it. 

                          JAEGER 
                We...we could go home with something
                else. 

                          WES
                What? 

                          JAEGER 
                With...with millions.  Millions of
                dollars. 

                          EPPS 
                What are you talking about?

     Jaeger pulls out the drawing from the puzzle box.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Don't even.  You're not going to show me
                that tired map. 

                          JAEGER
                Wait.  Wait. 

     Jaeger starts to tear at his pockets like he's trying to get
     at a bee.  He pulls out his other maps, recon photos...  The
     guy's a walking atlas.

     Epps looks on in shock at the spectacle. 

                          EPPS 
                I think you've got some issues to deal
                with.  Really, when we get out of here 
                I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you. 

                          JAEGER 
                Just listen to me!  I've been doing some
                reading.  In the Sixteenth century this
                region was invaded by the Turks.  It 
                became part of the Ottoman empire.  When
                the Turks rolled in they raped, they 
                pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who 
                had anything wanted to hide it from these
                bastards.  They buried their treasures,
                drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle 
                boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read
                about it. 

                          EPPS 
                     (Sarcastic) 
                Wellllll, if you read it it must be true.
                Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? 

                          JAEGER 
                Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this
                stuff. 

                          WES 
                The Turks invaded, yeah. I guess people
                would have hidden what they had.  But 
                that doesn't mean what was in that box
                is-- 

     Jager holds up the puzzle box drawing to one of the maps.

                          JAEGER 
                Looks at this!  Look at it!  The drawing
                is a map of this area right here.  You
                can see it.  The geography, the
                landmarks.  It's the same area. 

     Epps grabs the map from Jaeger.

                          EPPS 
                And you know what that area is?  It's
                Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing 
                with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe
                you've read about it. 

                          JAEGER 
                What we're doing is kicking ass.  For 
                God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering
                to news crews.  The war is over.  We've
                just got to keep shooting people 'cause 
                the army spent all this money, and we've
                got to put on a show for the taxpayers. 

                          WES 
                You're not saying what I think you're
                saying.  I can't believe you're even
                thinking it. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf.
                I got recon photos.  There're no troops
                there, no fighting-- 

                          WES 
                You don't know where the Iraqis have 
                moved to.  And our forces haven't even
                engaged the Republican Guard yet, we 
                don't know--

                          JAEGER 
                It's about a hundred miles from where we
                are now.  How long do you think it would
                take us to-- 

                          WES 
                It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred
                miles through three different kinds of 
                terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a
                river.  If the map is even real. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real. 

                          WES 
                So you just want to cross into hostile 
                territory in the middle of a war on a 
                wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him
                it's crazy, Epps. 

     Epps thinks.  He doesn't say nuthin', just thinks.  It's the
     thinking that makes Wes nervous.

                          WES(CONT)
                Epps, tell him. 

     Epps gets a little more thinking in.  Wes sees which way this
     is going. 

                          WES 
                You're out of your minds, you know that?
                Both of you.  You don't even know if 
                there's anything out there.  What the
                hell are you thinking? 

                          EPPS 
                I'm thinking about when this war is over.
                Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got
                tired of being president of GM?  If a
                brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs 
                there aren't too many big money prospects
                around, and I'm not particularly 
                interested in spending the rest of my 
                life fighting the oil companies' wars.
                So I say if maybe there's something out 
                there, what the hell, that's what I say. 

     Wes can't believe what he's hearing.  He pulls out the last
     card he has to play. 

                          WES 
                It's desertion.

     Jaeger sweeps a hand across the great nothingness.

                          JAEGER 
                Deserting what?  What the hell are we
                deserting? 

     Both Jaeger and Epps close on Wes for the hard sell. 

                          EPPS 
                It's war.  People get lost all the time
                in war, cut off--

                          JAEGER 
                We disappear for awhile.  We disappear,
                we came back; nobody knows nothing. 

                          EPPS 
                But we all got to be in for this.  We all
                go, or we do nothing. 

                          WES 
                Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I
                understand, but you're smarter. 

                          JAEGER 
                You know it's real.  You know it's real,
                and you know it's there.  You know it. 

                          WES 
                You're insane if you think you'll find
                anything, and sure insane if you think
                you can get us there and back alive. 

                          EPPS 
                If you say that, then I say you don't 
                know Second Lieutenant Epps very well, do
                you? 

     Wes buries his head in his hands.  He squeezes at it hard 
     like he'd rather make his brains ooze out his ears than say
     what he's going to say. 

                          WES 
                God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I
                don't. 

                          JAEGER
                Yes! 

                          EPPS 
                It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all
                right.

                          JAEGER 
                We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's
                that easy. 

     Jaeger and Epps start to pack up.  To no one in particular,
     and not too convincingly Wes mutters. 

                          WES 
                Yeah.  That easy. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     To strains of Hendrix's Wait Until Tomorrow the Humvee cuts 
     across the desert kicking up plumes of loose sand.  It looks
     more a dune buggy out for a joy ride than a military vehicle. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     I/E. HUMVEE - SIMULTANEOUS 

     Epps drives, Jaeger rides shotgun, relaxed, feet up on the 
     dash.  Wes is in back with a "what the fuck did I get myself
     into look on his face."  The Hendrix comes from a Walkman 
     hooked up to a pair of small speakers.  Basically these guys 
     are just kicking it.  War?  What war?  Our boys are just on a
     beer run.  Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all. 

                          EPPS 
                Now this is war. 

                          JAEGER
                Roger that. 

                          WES 
                We're going to get court martialed, you
                know that. 

                          JAEGER 
                Hell, we'll just buy our way out. 

     Epps picks up a map and gives it a read.  To Jaeger he says:

                          EPPS 
                Hand me the navicom.

     Jaeger hands Epps a piece of electronic hardware no bigger
     than a video box.  It's a navigational computer which can
     pinpoint its location, by satellite, within meters. 
     Basically the ultimate compass.  Epps compares the navicom's
     readout with the map. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Hold on boys and girls...hold on... 

     Epps watches the navicom...watches it... 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land
                of enchantment and riches.

                          WES
                Oh, God. 

                          JAEGER 
                You're such a pussy, you know that?
                How'd you get in the army? 

                          EPPS 
                Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes? 

                          WES
                What? 

                          EPPS 
                I know you think this is crazy, but a 
                couple of hours from now you're going to
                be one rich dude trying to buy up every
                other puzzle box out there. 

                          WES 
                I'd settle for being alive.  Really.
                Alive would be fine. 

                          JAEGER 
                Epps, is that a sand dune. 

                          WES 
                Oh, no. 

                          EPPS 
                Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is. 

                          WES 
                No, please, not again. 

     Epps punches the accelerator and the Humvee jumps forward
     like a horse out of the gate. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. HUMVEE - SIMULTANEOUS 

     The Humvee hits the dune and takes to the air.  As it arcs up
     and over the desert we hear.

                          WES(VO)
                Nooooooooo! 

     As gravity takes hold and brings the Hummer back to earth we:

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. HUMVEE - LATER 

     Epps is still taking it for a joy ride.  Wes is still getting
     sick. 

                          WES(VO) 
                Came on, I'm serious.  Knock it off. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     The Hummer hits yet another dune and takes flight. 

                          WES(VO) 
                This isn't funny, all right?  I mean it. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     I/E. HUMVEE - SIMULTANEOUS 

     The occupants jostle as the Hummer touches down.  Epps and
     Jaeger laugh and high five.  Wes is content just to go on
     looking sick. 

                          JAEGER
                Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you
                figure these people buried? 

                          WES 
                If!  If there's a treasure. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you
                figure it is? 

                          WES 
                I don't know.  It would be small, easy to
                transport and hide.  Gold or jewels.
                Probably gold.

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah!  Gold!  How much? 

                          WES 
                How the hell should I know how much? 

                          EPPS 
                But that's the great thing about Gold.  A
                little goes a long way. 

                          JAEGER 
                You know what I'm doing with my part of 
                the gold? 

                          WES 
                If there's gold.  If!

                          JAEGER 
                You know what I'm doing with my half? 

     Epps turns to Jaeger.  There's just the slightest, slightest
     hint of edge brushed across his tone.

                          EPPS 
                Third.  What you're going to do with your
                third. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going
                to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty-
                three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out
                and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet. 

                          EPPS 
                A car?  You're going to buy a car? 

                          WES 
                This is too much.  You don't even have
                the money and you're wasting it. 

                          JAEGER 
                A car is not just a car where I come 
                from.  I had this friend, had this wicked
                candy apple red Sixty-four and a half
                Mustang-- 

                          EPPS 
                You're getting gold, and you're going to 
                blow it on wheels? 

                          JAEGER 
                What are you going to do with your third? 

                          EPPS
                Invest it. 

                          JAEGER
                Oh, that's fun. 

                          EPPS 
                It's not about being fun.  It's about 
                being smart.  You take that money, you
                take care of it, let it grow, and you 
                don't ever have to do anything again. 
                Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm
                talking about.

                          JAEGER 
                And I'm talking about enjoying myself.

                          EPPS 
                You know, you sound just like a boy who's
                never-- 

                          WES
                What's that? 

     Jaeger and Epps look out the front windshield.  A plume of
     sand rises up from the desert several hundred meters before
     them.  So engrossed in their discussion previously they
     hadn't even noticed until Wes pointed it out. 

     Epps reaches over and kills the tape player.  A loud quiet
     comes with it.  All three men just stare at the plume as it
     drifts closer.  Finally: 

                          EPPS 
                Take the binoculars.

                          JAEGER
                Wh-what do you think--

                          EPPS
                TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!

     Jaeger scrambles up the binoculars, and stares off into the
     distance.  Epps and Wes wait...they wait... 

                          JAEGER 
                Iraqis. 

                          WES
                Oh, God! 

                          JAEGER 
                Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be
                here. 

                          WES
                Oh, Jesus! 

                          JAEGER 
                They're not...I had the pictures.
                They're not supposed to be here! 

                          EPPS 
                Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up! 

                          JAEGER 
                We've got to do something.  We've got to
                turn around.

                          EPPS 
                We can see them, they can see us.  We
                run, they chase.

                          WES
                What are we going to do? 

     Epps thinks.  Thinking's not good enough for Wes.

                          WES(CONT) 
                What are we going to do!? 

                          EPPS 
                We're going to keep driving. 

                          JAEGER
                They'll shoot us! 

                          EPPS 
                We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we
                keep driving they might think we 
                friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know
                we're Americans they might get scared, 
                think we're part of a detachment and keep
                on going. 

                          JAEGER 
                They're not going to-- 

                          EPPS 
                It's the only way.  We drive!

     Epps is right.  Jaeger and Wes know it.  They shut up and 
     ride.  Dig that tension:  Wes sweating, Epps giving the wheel
     a white knuckle grip.  Jaeger reaches down and readies his M-
     16.  When he chambers it, it sounds like thunder cracking. 

     The plume draws closer and closer until it's not just a 
     plume, but two dots.  Then it's two jeep-like vehicles.  Next
     we can even make out the passengers.

     That doesn't do much to relax our boys.

     Us, the Iraqis, we're almost on top of each other now.  The
     vehicles are going to pass within feet.  Epps throws in one
     more thing:

                          EPPS 
                Wave at them.  Don't look, just wave.

     All three throw up some weak, forced waves.  THE VEHICLES
     PASS.  Look at that:  The Iraqis are waving back.  And that's 
     all they're doing, just waving.

     Our boys break out into cheers. 

                          JAEGER
                Yeah!  Yeah! 

                          WES
                I think I'm going to throw up.  I am.
                I'm going to toss. 

                          JAEGER 
                You see that?  Right by us.  They went 
                right by.  You had them Epps; you called
                it. 

                          EPPS 
                Figure they don't want to mess with us 
                anymore than we want to mess with them. 

                          JAEGER 
                Look at you, not even breaking a sweat.
                You're cool, boy.  You're cool. 

     They all have a good laugh, but Wes brings that to a crashing
     halt.  Looking back at the Iraqis, in a voice dead with fear: 

                          WES
                They stopped. 

                          EPPS
                Wha... 

                          WES 
                Oh, Jesus, they've stopped. 

     Epps and Jaeger look behind them.

                          WES(CONT) 
                They stopped, and they've turned around. 

     The two Iraqi vehicles have stopped, they've turned, and now
     they're racing towards our boys.  Epps momentarily freezes.
     Jaeger helps him right out of it. 

                          JAEGER 
                Go, go, go! 

     Epps punches it, and the Hummer takes off.  The Iraqis are
     right behind them. 

     The vehicles all do same hard driving:  They twist and turn
     like wild snakes over the loose sand; hit dunes, take 
     flight... It's the open desert, and our boys have nowhere to
     hide. 

     Inside the Hummer it's a rough, rough ride.  Our boys are
     thrown violently about the cabin.  For Epps controlling the
     Hummer is about as easy as riding a wild horse. 

     The Iraqis turn things up a notch and start sending gunfire
     our way.  Bullets kick up around the Hummer like angry, 
     little bees with a hell of a sting.  Epps yells at Jaeger. 

                          EPPS
                Shoot them! 

     Now it's Jaeger who's freezes.  Epps returns the favor.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Shoot 'em! 

     Jaeger climbs back to the Humvee's machine gun, works the
     action and starts firing.  Unlike before when he was playing,
     the real thing is much wilder.  The Humvee bounces around 
     like a cork in the ocean.  Taking aim is nearly impossible.
     The best Jaeger can do is squeeze off rounds in the Iraqis'
     general direction. 

     All Wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared
     little girl. 

                          JAEGER
                Steady it out! 

                          EPPS 
                I steady it out, they blow us out of the
                sand! 

     It's like a dog fight in the dirt.  The vehicles weave,
     cut... One of the Iraqis starts to cut across Jaeger's firing
     line.  Jaeger swings the machine gun around hard and lets
     loose.  A hail of bullets rips into the Iraqi vehicle just
     above wheel level.  It kicks the vehicle up and back, 
     whipping and twisting it horribly in the air time after time,
     then smashing it back into the ground. 

     Jaeger is beside himself.

                          JAEGER 
                I got him!  You see that, I nailed him! 

     As if in answer the remaining Iraqi vehicle's gunner tears
     off a salvo that eats up the space right around Jaeger.  He's
     not hit, but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming
     with fear. 

                          EPPS
                Damn it!

     The boys are running out of options, and Epps knows it. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Wes, take the wheel. 

     No good. Wes is too scared to move.  Epps reaches back and
     literally pulls him up and over into the front. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Take it! 

     With little finesse Wes takes the wheel as Epps slides over.
     Epps takes up an M-16 with a grenade launcher.  He loads it
     up, and readies the weapon.  Crawling to the back he takes
     aim. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Keep it steady. 

     Wes does his best to give a level ride, but the Iraqi bullets
     coming at them don't help much. 

     Epps zeroes in on the target.  He takes aim and starts to
     squeeze back on the trigger.  He almost has a shot off when
     Wes hits a dune rocking the Hummer violently.  Epps loses the
     target. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Damn it!  I said keep it steady. 

     Epps tries to take aim again.  Careful aim.  One shot is all
     he gets.  The bullets keep coming, but he's in no hurry.
     Waiting...waiting...  The Iraqis are only getting closer. 

                          WES
                Shoot...shoot! 

     Waiting...

     Closer... 

                          WES
                SHOOT! 

     EPPS FIRES!  The grenade rips from the launcher, riding a 
     trail of white smoke, and slams into the Iraqis.  You know 
     the story:  Huge explosion, car parts flying a hundred feet
     into the air, bodies whipping through space, stuff Bob Dole
     would hate.  But maybe he would like it.  They were just
     Iraqis.

     Wes brings the Hummer to a halt.  A spastic, scared, relieved 
     laugh escapes him.  Jaeger, checking himself for wounds, and
     Epps, M-16 still in hand, get out.  Epps makes his way to the
     wreckage, sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any
     survivors.  Yeah, like somebody's walking away from that
     bang. 

     Wes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and
     stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was.

                          WES
                I thought we were dead. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, well, we're not. 

                          WES 
                We got to get out of here. 

     Nobody says anything.  This really scares Wes.

                          WES(CONT)
                We have to go back. 

                          JAEGER 
                We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we
                get what we came for. 

                          WES 
                     (Incredulous) 
                We just about got killed.  You know what
                happened?  We just about got killed, and 
                you want to go on? 

                          EPPS 
                Jaeger, go check out the Hummer for
                damage.

     Jaeger starts to cross back to the Hummer.  Wes gives him
     something to take with him. 

                          WES 
                You're crazy, you know that?  You're
                insane! 

     Jaeger goes leaving Epps and Wes all by their lonesome.  Wes
     turns to Epps.

                          WES(CONT) 
                You know that, right?  You know he's
                sick? 

     With a flip of his head Epps indicates the dead Iraqis.

                          EPPS 
                They shouldn't have been here.

                          WES 
                We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There
                is a war going on! 

                          EPPS 
                This is miles from the battle lines.
                They were probably deserters. 

                          WES 
                Deserters would have run, they wouldn't
                have engaged. 

                          EPPS 
                They shouldn't have been out this way,
                that's all I'm saying. 

     Wes starts to get it.  It really doesn't matter what he has
     to say. 

                          WES 
                We're not going back, are we? 

     Epps has got nothing to say to the truth.  He turns and
     starts to walk to the Hummer.

                          WES(CONT) 
                You bastard!  You're trying to get us
                killed. 

     Like a whip Epps snaps around.  He grabs up Wes and pulls him
     close. 

                          EPPS 
                I'm trying to get us paid.  I'm trying to
                get us all paid!  As long as there's a 
                chance something is out there we go on.
                There's not going to be anymore trouble.
                If there is, we go back, but there won't
                be. 

     Almost as an afterthought Epps realizes he's got Wes, and
     lets him go.  Gently he puts it: 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You'll feel different after we find the
                treasure.  Money has away of making
                people feel different. 

     Nobody's got anytbing to say to that, so they say nothing.
     Epps heads back to the Hummer.  A beat later Wes follows.

     Jaeger is already behind the wheel.  Epps rides shotgun this
     time.  Once again Wes is in back.  To Jaeger, Epps ask: 

                          EPPS
                She okay? 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine. 

                          EPPS
                Let's go.

     Jaeger fires it up, and pulls out.  As they head off we: 

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK

                                                           FADE TO:

     I/E. HUMVEE - LATER 

     The sun beats down violently as the Hummer rolls along.
     Epps, Jaeger and Wes all ride along in an angry silence.
     Jaeger starts to smile.  He chuckles to himself.  Epps, 
     looking for anything to break the tension smiles a bit 
     himself. 

                          EPPS
                What? 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest
                of the boys knew what we're doing.  I
                mean if they knew what we were coming
                back with. 

                          EPPS 
                You can't tell anybody about this. 

                          JAEGER 
                I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they
                knew.  We're going to be millionaires,
                man.  Millionaires! 

     Epps joins in cackling like a Hyena. 

                          EPPS 
                It'd make their heads explode.

                          JAEGER 
                Millionaires, man. 

     He turns back to Wes.

                          JAEGER(CONT} 
                You know we're going to be rich.  Admit
                it.  You know.  Come on, admit it. 

     In spite of himself Wes gives a little smile.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                Ahh, there it is.  There it is.  You know
                it. 

     Singing to Levert: 

                          EPPS 
                Money, money, money, money...MONEY. 

     Jaeger joins in. 

                          EPPS/JAEGER 
                Money, money, money, money...MONEY. 

     Epps starts to slow down. 

                          WES 
                What are you doing.

                          EPPS 
                Low on gas.  Got to refill. 

     A nervous look punches it way onto Jaeger's face.  Epps
     stops.  He and Wes jump out of the Hummer and go around back 
     to the reserve tanks.

     Jaeger stays in the vehicle looking all tense.  After a beat
     Epps screams for him. 

                          EPPS(O.C.)
                Jaeger...JAEGER! 

     Time to face the music.  Jaeger hauls himself out of the 
     Hummer and goes around to Epps who's got a look on his face
     like he's just had a spoonful of steaming shit.  He points
     angrily at one of the reserve tanks. 

                          EPPS 
                Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell.
                It's been leaking gas since the fire 
                fight.  I told you to check for damage. 

                          JAEGER
                ...I know. 

                          EPPS 
                And you missed this?  How are you going
                to miss something like this? 

                          JAEGER 
                I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew 
                one of the reserves got hit you'd want to
                turn back. 

                          WES 
                So, you just let us drive on knowing we 
                were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going
                to run low in the middle of nowhere? 

                          JAEGER 
                ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back. 

     Wes gets a slow boil on. 

                          WES 
                ...You stupid son of a bitch. 

     Wes lunges for Jaeger, but doesn't have the speed or the
     skills.  Jaeger counters, and sinks a fist into Wes' jaw. 
     Wes goes down, but he manages to take Jaeger to the sand with
     him.  They start to scrape, but it's obvious Jaeger has got
     the upper hand.

     Epps reaches down and yanks Jaeger off of Wes.

                          EPPS
                Get off him. 

     Jaeger comes up to his feet.  Wes wipes some blood from his 
     lips.  He looks down at his bloodied hand, then sneers at
     Jaeger. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You two fighting's not going to get us 
                anything.

                          WES 
                Him getting us stranded out here doesn't
                do much good either.

                          JAEGER 
                We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas
                in the other reserve to get us back.

                          WES 
                Then lets go back while we still can.

                          JAEGER 
                As soon as we hit the mountain we would 
                have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not
                that far.  We can make it. 

                          EPPS 
                What do we do with the Humvee?

                          JAEGER
                We leave it. 

                          WES 
                What if someone takes it? 

     Jaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert.

                          JAEGER
                Who?  Who's going to take it.  We mark
                the location with the navicom, we can
                come right back to this spot. 

     Wes has had enough. 

                          WES 
                You two don't even know how crazy you 
                are.  You want to go on your sick, little
                treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me
                absent. 

                          JAEGER 
                You have to go with us, Wes. 

                          WES 
                Really?  What is that, an order, private? 

                          JAEGER 
                You have to go with us.  You can't walk
                back... 

     Jaeger dangles the keys to the Humvee from a finger.

                          JAEGER{CONT) 
                And you sure as hell aren't going to
                drive. 

     Wes burns a hole through Jaeger's head with his eyes.  Epps
     steps to him.

                          EPPS 
                Load what you can; water, tools, weapons.
                Anything you think we might need. 

     Wes burns on a bit more, then turns and heads for the Hummer.
     Jaeger watches him go, then smiles to himself.

                          JAEGER
                Who's he kidding?  He wants it as bad as
                we do.  We're going to be fat, Epps.  As
                soon as we get back to Saudivillie you
                and me are going to-- 

     Epps gets up in Jaeger's face.  The menace he projects is
     very real. 

                          EPPS 
                We're going to keep going 'cause I want
                some of whatever's out there.  But you 
                ever pull something like trying to get my
                ass stranded out here again, and I'll
                kill you myself.  You got that? 

     Jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                SAY IT! 

                          JAEGER
                I got that...sir. 

     Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all
     scared with himself. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     A long line of footprints works their way through the sand up
     to Epps, Jaeger, and Wes.  Epps and Wes trek side by side.

     Jaeger is behind them, having trouble keeping up.  Between
     pants he gasps:

                          JAEGER 
                Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to
                go so fast. 

                          EPPS 
                Faster we get there, faster we get back. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you. 

     Jaeger struggles on just a bit more, then:

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a
                little water. 

                          EPPS 
                Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you
                aren't getting any of ours.

                          JAEGER 
                I'm just going to have a little sip,
                that's all.  Just a sip. 

     Jaeger lets himself drop down into the sand.  He looks up.
     Epps and Wes are still walking. 

                          JAGER{CONT)
                Wait for me! 

                          EPPS
                You can catch up. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah...I'm right behind you. 

     Wes looks back at Jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his
     water. 

                          WES 
                Thanks for straightening out Jaeger.

     Epps shrugs, like hitting Jaeger wasn't much of anything.

                          EPPS 
                Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But
                if we do it, we do it right.  I just
                needed to explain that in a way I
                wouldn't have to do it again. 

                          WES
                Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an
                idiot. 

                          EPPS
                He's not so-- 

                          WES 
                He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as
                hard as he thinks.

                          EPPS 
                How tough you have to be to make the 
                army?  All you've got to do is shoot a
                gun, and stop a bullet.

     Again Epps looks behind him as Jaeger struggles to his feet
     and stumbles after his two comrades.

                          WES 
                Look at him.  We ought to just leave him
                behind. 

     Epps gives a little laugh like he's just heard a mildly
     amusing punchline.

                          WES(CONT) 
                Like he said:  People get lost in wars
                all the time.  And out here?  Out here
                there are eight million ways to die. 

     All this talk starts to creep out Epps a little. 

                          EPPS 
                Okay, so he was riding you.  Get over it.

     Wes smiles a little smile. 

                          WES
                I'm just talking. 

     They walk on.

     Jaeger works to catch up, muttering to himself as he goes.

                          JAEGER
                Can't even slow up for me.  Wasn't for me
                they wouldn't even be here.  I'm the one
                that found the map.  Should have just 
                come by myself.  Should've.  Shouldn't
                even cut them in.  Shouldn't. 

     As Jaeger steps down be hears an audible clicking sound come 
     from under his boot.  He goes dead still.  Panic races up and
     down his spine.  In almost a whisper be says:

                          JAEGER
                Epps... 

     Again, louder: 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Epps! 

     Like he couldn't be more annoyed Epps turns around.

                          EPPS
                What!? 

                          JAEGER
                Mine. 

     Epps isn't sure of what he's heard. 

                          EPPS
                What? 

                          JAEGER
                Mine.  Land mine!

     Epps doesn't say anything, he just keeps on staring.  Scared,
     angry they don't get it: 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I stepped on a land mine!

     Epps and Wes look at each other, then back to Jaeger.  Like
     he's got no time to mess around: 

                          EPPS 
                You didn't step on any mine. 

                          JAEGER
                I heard it click. 

                          EPPS 
                If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by
                now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines
                anymore. 

                          JAEGER
                I heard it.

                          WES 
                Maybe it's just a can, or something. 

     Jaeger loses it. 

                          JAEGER 
                JESUS CHRIST, I'M STANDING ON A MINE.
                SHUT UP, AND GET OVER HERE! 

     Just plain sick of all this, Epps and Wes trudge back over to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS 
                Paranoid, that's your problem.  You're
                just paranoid.  Why'd the paranoid one
                have to find the map? 

     Epps pulls a knife from his belt.  He sinks to the ground and
     probes the sand under Jaeger's foot.  Nothing...nothing... 
     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF METAL AGAINST METAL.  Epps goes white.
     For a second he doesn't move.  Tension falls like a steel
     curtain.  Slow, careful, Epps withdraws the blade and stands.
     Jaeger reads the expression on Epps' face. 

                          JAEGER
                Oh, God!  Oh God! 

                          EPPS
                Just be cool. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's a mine, isn't it? 

                          EPPS
                Just relax. 

                          JAEGER 
                How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!? 

                          EPPS 
                We're going to get off, all right.  We'll
                get you off of there.  Just...be cool. 

     Epps goes to Wes.  The two start to move away from Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER
                Where you going? 

                          EPPS 
                Me and Wes are just going to talk. 

                          JAEGER 
                Why you got to move away to talk!? 

                          EPPS 
                We're going to be right over here. 

                          JAEGER 
                You're moving away because it's going to
                blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow
                up! 

                          EPPS 
                I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool! 

     Epps and Wes move over and huddle.

                          WES 
                What kind of mine? 

                          EPPS 
                I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess
                with it. 

                          WES
                Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse,
                that's Vietnam stuff. 

                          EPPS 
                Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford,
                okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. 
                Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe 
                it's going to go off in two seconds, and
                we won't have to worry about getting 
                Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to
                worry about is finding the pieces. 

     Behind them, pathetically, Jaeger cries: 

                          JAEGER
                Epps... 

                          WES 
                Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be
                able to get him off it anyway. 

                          EPPS
                There's a way. 

                          JAEGER
                Epps...

                          WES 
                Can't do it.  Can't do it, and keep him 
                alive. 

     Epps' eyes narrow.  He doesn't want to hear this kind of
     talk. 

                          EPPS 
                I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.

                          JAEGER 
                Epps, my leg is falling asleep. 

     Epps thinks, and thinks hard.

                          EPPS
                     (To Wes) 
                We've got rope? 

                          WES
                For climbing.

                          EPPS
                Break it out. 

     Epps crosses back over to Jaeger.

                          JAEGER
                My leg is falling asleep. 

                          EPPS
                It's not falling asleep.  You've only
                been standing there for three minutes. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's
                falling asleep. 

                          EPPS 
                It falls asleep and you die, so wake it
                the hell up. 

     Wes crosses over with climbing rope.  Very, very gently Epps
     wraps the middle of the rope around Jaeger's waist leaving
     several feet dangling off each end. 

                          JAEGER 
                How's this going to work? 

                          EPPS 
                Me and Wes each going take an end of the 
                rope, run our asses of, and yank you off
                the mine. 

                          JAEGER 
                That's going to do it, right?  I'm going
                to be okay.

     Not too convincingly: 

                          EPPS
                You're going to be fine. 

                          JAEGER
                You're not going to let me die, are you!?
                Don't let me die! 

     Ignoring the question:

                          EPPS 
                When we start running suck up your 
                breath.  You're going to get the wind
                knocked out of you. 

                          JAEGER 
                Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to
                die. 

     Epps and Wes pick up separate ends of the rope, and take up 
     positions behind Jaeger.  Epps waits a beat, afraid of what
     might happen, but there is no choice.  He digs in ready to
     take off running.  Wes whispers to him:

                          WES 
                What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to
                bounce right up out of the ground, 
                explode in the air, kill him and us. 

                          EPPS
                You just go when I say go. 

                          WES 
                Should have at least gotten the map off
                of him.  Blows up with him then we did
                all this for nothing. 

     Ignoring him: 

                          EPPS
                Ready? 

                          WES
                Yeah. 

     Epps takes a couple of deep breaths, holds one: 

                          EPPS
                GO! 

     Wes and Epps are off the the races, churning up sand as they
     race away from Jaeger.  They scream like banshees as if to
     draw strength.

     Jaeger does a little chant: 

                          JAEGER 
                Oh, God.  Oh, God! 

     The rope goes taught.  Jaeger's body jerks violently backward
     as he gets the air punched out of him.  As his feet leave the
     ground the mine detonates.

                                                            CUT TO:

     POV - JAEGER 

     A fireball blossoms, and eats up the air towards the camera
     as THE CAMERA ITSELF RUSHES AWAY from the belching fire and
     smoke. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     JAEGER 

     His feet just clear the outer edge of the fireball, but still
     get licked and burned by flames before he slams to the ground
     several feet from the explosion. 

     Epps runs to Jaeger.  Wes takes a casual stroll back over. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm all right.  Oh, Jesus, I'm all right. 

     All casual like, Wes says: 

                          WES
                The map okay? 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER

     We see a set of three very odd tracks across the ground.  It
     looks like something has been dragged through the sand.  THE
     CAMERA FOLLOWS THE TRACKS TO EPPS, WES AND JAEGER who crawl
     on their bellies.  They thrust knifes into the sand before 
     them searching for mines.  We get the feeling they've been at
     this for awhile.

                          WES
                How long we going to keep this up. 

                          JAEGER 
                Until we're out of the mine field is how
                long. 

                          WES 
                Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.

                          JAEGER 
                That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could 
                have just spread them out like that; make
                us think we're in the clear. 

                          WES 
                You want to crawl, crawl. 

     Wes stands and starts to walk.  Epps waits a beat and follows
     suit.  Only Jaeger stays down. 

                          JAEGER 
                You're going to blow yourselves up. 

                          EPPS 
                Wes is right.  If there were any more 
                mines we would have found them.  Hell, 
                that one you stepped on was probably old 
                anyway; left over from the war with Iran.

                          JAEGER 
                You don't know that.  It could be a trick. 

                          EPPS 
                If we step on a mine we'll know it was.
                Let me see the maps.

     Jaeger stays down, afraid to get up. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Get up and give me the maps.

     After a beat Jaeger stands and hands over the map from the
     puzzle box and a recon photo.  Epps compares the two, then
     takes out the navicom. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                We're on course.  Northeast, twenty-eight
                degrees.  When we hit the base of the 
                mountain we'll find a pass.  I can see it
                on the recon photo.  Shouldn't be too 
                hard to traverse.  That'll take us to the
                top and... 

     Epps points at a black dot on the puzzle box map with a
     smaller white dot in the middle. 

                          EPPS 
                This.  Whatever it is. 

                          JAEGER 
                It's the treasure, that's what it is. 

                          WES
                It better be. 

     Epps starts to pack away the map.  Real plain Jaeger says:

                          JAEGER
                The map. 

     Epps stops, like he almost not sure what Jaeger is talking
     about.  Jaeger extends a hand. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                The map. 

     Epps gets it.  He hands the map back to Jaeger who tucks it
     away.  Our boys walk on. 

                          EPPS 
                You're not losing trust, are you? 

                          JAEGER
                Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang
                on to it. 

                          WES 
                If all we wanted was the map out of you
                we could have taken it while you were
                standing on that mine pissing on
                yourself. 

                          JAEGER 
                Probably would've too if Epps wasn't
                around to stop you. 

                          EPPS 
                I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause 
                nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in
                this together, understand? 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to
                come along in the first place, but he 
                gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet
                deal. 

                          WES 
                I'm getting tired of you riding me,
                Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 
                Anytime you want to do something about it
                just let-- 

     Epps stops dead in his tracks.

                          EPPS
                Quiet! 

     They all go quiet. Epps cocks an ear to the air and listens.
     They all listen.  Wind, but that's about it. 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't hear any-- 

                          EPPS 
                Shut up and listen!

     Again they listen.  Again they hear wind.  Then, there it is;
     the sound Epps is looking for:  A pop, like a big balloon
     being burst just over the next rise. 

                          WES
                Gunfire. 

     Quick like that Jaeger grabs his M-16 down off his shoulder
     and is about to ready it when Epps slaps down the muzzle.

                          EPPS
                Don't! 

                          JAEGER 
                It's a fire fight. 

                          EPPS 
                Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight.
                That's not a battle going on. 

                          WES
                What is it? 

     Epps thinks.  Yeah, what the hell is it? 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT - RISE 

     Epps, Jaeger, and Wes edge carefully up to the lip of the 
     rise on their bellies.  They're barely visible against the
     sand.  Epps takes out a pair of binoculars and zeros in on
     the ground below. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     POV - EPPS 

     THROUGH BINOCULAR LENSES we see a SHI'ITE CAMP:  A tent city 
     really.  There are several uniformed IRAQI SOLDIERS who are
     roughing up the Shi'ite men.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS, WES, JAEGER 

                          JAEGER 
                What is it? 

     Epps hands the binoculars over to Jaeger.  Who looks down at
     the scene on the ground.

                          EPPS 
                Iraqis.  A bunch of them. 

                          JAEGER 
                What are they doing here? 

     Jaeger hands the binoculars to Wes.

                          EPPS 
                Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm
                guessing that has something to do with
                them being here.

                          JAEGER 
                What are they doing in the middle of
                nowhere? 

                          WES 
                Maybe they're looking for gold.

     POV - WES 

     AGAIN WE SEE THROUGH THE BINOCULAR LENSES.  One of the Iraqi
     soldiers is pushing around a Shi'ite, having a good laugh 
     about it, then casual as rain pulls out a gun and gives him a
     bullet, gift wrapped, straight to the brain. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS, WES, JAEGER

                          JAEGER 
                Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for?
                They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing
                Iraqis? 

                          WES 
                Those people down there are Shi'ites.
                You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq
                and Khurds in the North.  Neither of
                them've got much love for Saddam. 
                Probably figured once the war started 
                there might be an uprising, so he sent
                his soldiers out to slap them around some. 

                          EPPS 
                They're doing more than slapping.

                          JAEGER 
                The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't
                know that. 

                          WES 
                Is there anything you do know? 

                          JAEGER 
                I know you're a pussy.  I know that. 

                          EPPS 
                All right.  Let's get out of here. 

                          WES 
                The soldiers are going to kill those
                people! 

                          JAEGER
                So? 

                          WES
                We have to do something. 

                          EPPS
                There's nothing we can do.

                          WES 
                We can fight.  That's what we're here 
                for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the
                Shi'ites, and the Khurds. 

                          JAGER 
                I didn't sign up to help any Shi'ites.
                All we were supposed to do is get the 
                Iraqis out of Kuwait, and if we aren't
                doing that then all bets are off. 

                          EPPS 
                We carrying any ordinance? 

                          WES 
                Some extra grenades.  A Claymore. 

     Epps thinks, then shakes his head.

                          EPPS 
                Not enough.  We're out numbered and out
                gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.

                          JAEGER 
                So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for 
                playing.  We have some lovely parting
                gifts for you as you go. 

                          WES 
                We're American soldiers.  We don't
                abandon people. 

                          JAEGER 
                Funny you should say that while we're out
                looking for gold. 

                          WES 
                You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so
                bad. 

                          JAEGER 
                I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich.
                The only way the Iraqis figure into that
                is not at all. 

                          EPPS
                     (To Wes) 
                I don't want to see people killed any 
                more than you.  But we try to help out we
                die, and all we do is die. 

                          WES 
                We can't just go off and-- 

                          EPPS 
                There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't
                even be here in the first place. 

     There's a big, loud quiet as our boys just hang there.  From
     down below comes another balloon burst; another gun shot.

     Epps lowers his head.  He wants to fight, but it's like he 
     said:  There's nothing they can do.  Epps slides back away 
     from the rise, then Jaeger, and finally Wes disappears back
     the way they came.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. DESERT/MOUNTAINS - LATER 

     It's the kind of red rock and mesas one would expect to find 
     in a desert; not too steep or rough, but it looks as though
     they will definitely takes more than a little physical
     exertion to navigate. 

     Epps, Wes, and Jaeger approach a path at the mesa's base.
     Jaeger takes out his maps and looks them over.

                          JAEGER 
                This is it.  We're right on target. 

     Epps takes a long gander up towards the top of the mesa.

                          EPPS 
                All we've got to do is make it to the
                top.

                          WES 
                And find the treasure, and get it, and 
                get back to the Humvee, and get the hell
                out of Iraqi without getting our heads
                blown off, but that's about it. 

                          EPPS 
                We're not going to find anything standing
                here.  Let's get to climbing. 

     They ready their packs and weapons, then start up the mesa.

                                                           FADE TO:

     Our boys trekking along the pass.  They push onward and
     upward.

                                                           FADE TO:

     The pass has narrowed, and become more treacherous:  The
     rocks are loose and the footing unsure.  The going has slowed
     considerably as each man must be extremely careful of their
     steps.

                                                           FADE TO: 

     Our boys stop.  The pass has seemingly came to an end.  For a
     short ways the face of the mesa is almost sheer.  The three
     soldiers take it in. 

                          EPPS 
                Not much of a pass.

                          WES 
                Probably was a couple of hundred years
                ago when whoever drew the map came 
                through here.  Worn down to nothing now.

                          EPPS 
                Picks up again just on the other side. 

     They all take a good look at what little there is to cross 
     on, and how far down it is to the hard, jagged rocks below. 

                          JAEGER 
                Think we can make it? 

                          WES 
                We make it, or we go back empty handed.

                          EPPS 
                Looks like we make it. 

     Epps and Wes edge their way towards what's left of the pass.
     Jaeger just stands there staring down.  Way down.

                                                           FADE TO: 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of
     the mesa.  Small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to
     the ground below.  No man says a word, they're too busy 
     trying to keep alive, and the air is filled with the sounds
     of labored breathing.

     Each step so very careful:  Testing the pass for purchase,
     making sure the footing is solid.  They inch one foot
     forward, then slide over the next.  Their hands probe the
     cliff face, fingers crawling like spider legs, looking for
     something, anything, to take hold of. 

     Sweat drips into Epps eye.  He blinks hard and fast trying to
     clear his vision.  Right now he can't really afford
     distractions. 

     Slowly, carefully, inch by inch the little death dance goes
     on. 

     Jaeger steps.  He steps wrong.  The pass gives way under his 
     foot and begins to slide down.  Instinctively Wes rockets out
     an arm grabbing Jaeger by the uniform.  At first Jaeger 
     smiles, glad for the save.  But then he realizes something: 
     Wes is literally holding his life in his hands.  All Wes has
     to do is loosen his grip, and...

     The color drains from Jaeger's face.  Wes stares back blank
     as a bowl of water. 

     Eternity goes on for a second. 

     Finally Wes yanks Jaeger back up against the mesa's face,
     then slides on.  Jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat
     clutching the rocks for dear life.

                                                           FADE TO:

     Epps makes it to the far side of the broken pass.  He holds
     out a hand to Wes and reels him in.  Together they both help
     bring in Jaeger.  Wes looks back over the path they've just
     crossed. 

                          WES 
                The US Army:  Always an adventure.

                          EPPS 
                Let me see the map.

     Jaeger hands the map to Epps who gives it a going over.  THEY
     WALK AS THEY TALK.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Should be easy going from here.  Stay on
                the pass straight to the dot. 

                          WES 
                What do you figure it to be? 

                          EPPS 
                Got to be some kind of landmark;
                something distinctive.

                          JAEGER
                X marks the spot.

                          EPPS 
                Something like that.

                          JAEGER 
                But the white dot in the middle; that's
                got to mean something.

                          EPPS 
                I hope it means something, otherwise...

                          WES 
                Otherwise whatever we're looking for
                could be anywhere.

                          EPPS 
                Basically.  But the map has been pretty
                precise so far.  I don't think it'll be
                too hard to-- 

     Our boys step past a grouping of rocks.  They stop dead.
     Sitting before them, in what looks like a small camp, is FIVE
     IRAQI SOLDIERS.  Time clicks by real slow for an instant.
     It's a delayed reaction, like the beat it takes after you
     pick up a hot pan before you realize that, yeah, it is
     burning the flesh from your hand. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Take cover! 

     Our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came.
     They run like wild rabbits for a bit, jumping over a rock
     formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover. 
     Like well-trained warriors they peel their weapons from their
     shoulders, lock and load, and stand ready.  They wait a bit,
     taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under.
     Finally Epps gives the order. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Let's hit 'em! 

     Simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear
     down on the Iraqis with their M-16s ready to blow them to
     kingdom come. 

     One problem:  No Iraqis.

     For a beat our three don't move.  They hold position, breath
     coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race.  They're 
     eyes flint back and forth scanning for something...anything.
     There's nothing. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Cover me. 

     M-16 still at the ready, Epps raises up taking a tactical
     stance.  He inches forward, sweeping his weapon back and 
     forth before him for any potential target.  There is none.
     The Iraqis have vanished.  Epps lowers the M-16, but does not
     shoulder it. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Clear. 

     Wes and Jaeger come up from their cover and cross to Epps.
     They keep their weapons ready.  Eerily they all look around
     as if trying to spot ghosts.

                          WES 
                Where'd they go? 

                          EPPS 
                I don't know.  There's a lot of space up
                here.  They could be just about-- 

                          WES 
                Weird they didn't chase us.

                          JAEGER 
                Maybe they're as scared of us as we are
                of them. 

                          WES 
                Just seems weird they didn't chase us.

                          EPPS 
                What's weird is how they disappeared. 
                Doesn't make sense.  Doesn't...

     There is a sound; a steady swooshing that starts faint and 
     grows closer like a rolling thunder.  Our three start looking
     around, turning where they stand, trying to find the source
     of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch.  There's
     nothing.  They see nothing.  Still the sound races closer and
     closer.  Epps, Jaeger and Wes raise up their weapons in
     preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast.

     From below the edge of the mesa a HELICOPTER GUNSHIP -
     probably a MIL MI-24 HIND-D ARMED ASSAULT HELICOPTER if you
     want to be technical - raises up very dramatically into
     sight.  It hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers.
     On board are the vanished Iraqis wearing nasty grins.  The
     PILOT brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine
     cannons at our boys.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Scatter! 

     Wes and Jaeger don't have to be told twice.  They bolt from
     their spots, and not an instant too soon.  The GUNNER lets
     fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground
     where our boys were just standing.  We see what the chopter's 
     weapons will do to rock.  We can imagine what they would do
     to flesh. 

     Epps, Jaeger and Wes take cover behind some rocks.  The 
     gunship swings around, picks up speed and bears down on them. 

     More shells fired.  They punch into and through the rocks our
     boys use for cover.  Again the three scatter, and just in
     time as the shells rip their way through the rock.

     Our three go sliding down an embankment, crouching low.
     Their heads whip around looking for the gunship.

                          JAEGER 
                Where is it?  Where'd it go? 

                          EPPS
                Stay low. 

                          JAEGER 
                Where the hell is it!? 

                          EPPS
                Just stay down. 

     In answer to Jaeger's question the gunship comes swooping up
     behind them like a bird of prey.  Our three have all of about
     a second to get running before the Iraqis send more shells
     their way.  They kick up chunks of rock as they ping, ping, 
     ping around Epps, Wes and Jaeger who make a wild, evasive
     run.

     Dig it:  Up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face.
     They race for it, hurl themselves into it as the gunship
     sends a special delivery of white-hot metal their way. 

     Once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space.
     It's too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through. 
     Our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck
     air.

     Beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and
     forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom. 

     Jaeger's worked up a real scare. 

                          JAEGER 
                What are we going to do?  What the hell
                are we going to do? 

                          EPPS 
                We're not going to do anything.

                          JAEGER
                     (Panicked) 
                They're going to kill us!

                          EPPS
                They can't shoot us in here.

                          WES 
                And they can't fly around out there
                forever.

                          EPPS
                So we wait. 

                          JAEGER
                If they land-- 

                          EPPS 
                If they land, we can take them.  If they
                don't land, then we've got nothing to
                worry about. 

     Wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air.
     It floats very steady as if...  Wes' eyes key in on 
     something:  The gunship's missile pods rotating slightly, 
     coming in line... Wes' eyes go wide like someone just jammed
     an electric cattle prod in his ass. 

                          WES
                Missile! 

                          EPPS
                Move! 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of
     the passage as a missile rockets from the gunship's pod.
     With a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow
     straight into the passage.  Slamming into the ground it
     sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive 
     explosion.  It races through the passage, lifts our boys from
     the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were
     nothing more than discarded ragdolls.

     Jaeger takes cover and cowers.  He puts his panic into
     overdrive. 

     Wes pulls his rifle.  Grunting like an animal he sprays 
     bullets at the chopter, but it's like throwing snowballs at
     an elephant.  The gunship turns on Wes and fires in his 
     direction.  It doesn't hit him, but it sends him running.

     Epps has had enough of this shit.  He scrambles to load a 
     grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about.  It races 
     for him, cannons at the ready.  This one is going to be 
     close.  Epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down 
     on him.  Epps fires, but the gunship simply jukes up and away
     from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug.  The
     grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding
     harmlessly.  The chopter returns the favor by reining down a
     hail of shells that kicks Epps back FLIPPING HIM UP AND OVER
     the edge of the plateau.  His M-16 goes flying, smashing into
     the ground far below.  Epps manages to grab hold of the 
     plateau lip with one hand.  It swings him around, slamming 
     him hard against the cliff face.  He hangs there, suspended by
     his weakening grip, far above the ground.

                          JAEGER
                Epps! 

     Jaeger and Wes run to him, grabbing him by his arm.  They
     pull and pull hard until Epps can get some kind of purchase,
     and crawl his way back up to the plateau.

     At the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers
     above and beyond our three.  It rotates so that the bay doors
     are facing Epps, Wes and Jaeger.  Three Iraqis are inside,
     weapons trained on our targets.  One of them yells something.
     Wes translates.

                          WES 
                They want us to surrender.

     The three share a nervous look.  Epps fairly growls:

                          EPPS 
                Yeah, I'll surrender. 

     Jaeger and Wes watch as, shielded by their bodies, Epps palms
     a grenade from his belt.  Wes and Jaeger don't quite smile,
     but they know now they at least have a chance.  As Epps
     stands the other two turn to face the Iraqis.  They all fold
     their hands behind their necks which, for Epps, hides the
     grenade from view.  Slowly they walk towards the gunship.
     One of the Iraqis starts to yell something.  He lifts his
     weapon and aims it at our boys.  With his thumb Epps yanks 
     the pin from the grenade and lets fly.  It's a perfect toss,
     landing in the chopter's bay.  The Iraqis see the grenade 
     land, they scramble for it.  One of them grabs it up and is
     about to throw it back out of the gunship. 

     Too late. 

     The grenade explodes in the Iraqi's hand killing him
     instantly.  It also touches off a fire ball that severely 
     damages the gunship.  It rocks, lists, spins wildly out of
     control. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Get down!

     Our three hug the ground as the chopter's rotors go whipping
     through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among
     them.  Worse still the gunship, now a lame bird, drops from
     the sky towards Epps, Jaeger and Wes.  All they can do is 
     cover their heads, as if that would do any good against two
     tons of crashing steel.  The chopter rushes down...down, but
     it just misses them.  It slams into the ground skipping over
     the edge of the plateau, to the rocks below. 

     Our three pick themselves up.  They walk to the edge of the
     plateau and look down on the crash. 

     Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees
     and looks as if he's about to go into shock.

                          JAEGER
                Oh, God... 

     Wes looks down at Jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer. 

                          WES 
                Yeah.  Just keeps getting better and
                better, doesn't it? 

     They stare for awhile, then one by one move off.  Us?  We:

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT/MESA - LATER 

     Epps, Wes and Jaeger trek to a large crevice that runs 
     straight down into the ground.  Jaeger takes out his maps and
     photos.  Epps consults the navicom.

                          WES 
                What do you think? 

                          JAEGER 
                Lines up with the map and the photos.

                          EPPS 
                We're right where we should be. 

     Epps tucks the navicom away on his belt and takes a look
     around.  Not much to see.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                I sure don't see much place else around
                here to hide anything.

     Wes pulls a lantern/flashlight from his pack.  Going to his
     belly he shines it down into the crevice.

                          WES 
                Can't see anything.

     He tosses a rock into it.  We can hear it hit the ground below.

                          WES(CONT)
                It's got a bottom. 

                          JAEGER 
                Guess we know what the next stop is. 

                          EPPS 
                All right.  Let's break out some utility 
                shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case
                we have to do any blasting.  Me and 
                Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can
                see. 

                          WES 
                What am I supposed to do? 

                          EPPS 
                Got to have someone here in case we need
                help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to
                have a look out either. 

                          JAEGER 
                Think there might be more Iraqis? 

                          EPPS 
                Right now I wouldn't be surprised if 
                Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The
                Clowns. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     WE SEE A FEW QUICK SHOTS of Wes securing a line down into the
     crevice, Epps and Jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses, the
     two men lowering themselves down into the great unknown.

                                                            CUT TO: 

     INT. CREVICES - CONTINUOUS 

     The lantern punches a hole through the darkness as Epps uses
     it like a machete to blaze a trial.  He sinks down...down 
     until finally they touch bottom.  He unclips himself from the
     rope and Jaeger starts down.

     The space isn't that big, like a small cave really.  It's 
     tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole
     of it.  But it's big enough that one wouldn't have any idea
     where to start digging. 

     Jaeger makes it to the bottom.  Wes yells down. 

                          WES
                You down? 

                          JAEGER
                Yeah, we're down. 

                          WES 
                What do you see? 

                          EPPS
                Nothing. 

     More to himself:

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                A whole lot of nothing. 

                          JAEGER 
                So where do we start? 

     Epps takes a look around, then shrugs.

                          EPPS 
                Wherever you want. 

     Epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack.  Jaeger
     follows suit.  He looks around, picks a spot and starts
     digging. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     WES - LATER

     He sits up top, weapon in hand, standing guard.

     EPPS AND JAEGER - LATER

     They dig furiously at sperate ends of the cave.  They dig
     with a determination to find something.

     WES - LATER 

     Still up top, he's given up on standing guard.  Now he
     stretches out on the ground sunning himself.

                                                           FADE TO:

     EPPS AND JAEGER 

     Their shirts are off, and they're caked with sweat and dirt. 
     They look like they've been digging for quite some time. 

     They certainly don't have the same enthusiasm they displayed
     previously.  Now they just seem to dig by rote. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     WES - LATER 

     The sun has begun to sink noticeably.  Wes leans over the 
     crevice. 

                          WES 
                Hey...Hey!  Sun's going down.  Epps!
                Jaeger!  It's getting dark up here. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS AND JAEGER - SIMULTANEOUS 

     It's obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come 
     up with nothing.  Epps keeps digging, but just barely. 
     Jaeger doesn't even bother anymore.  He just sits on the
     ground sulking.

                          WES(O.C.)
                Epps! 

                          EPPS
                I heard!

     He rolls over and scoffs.

                          WES
                There's nothing down there.

     EPPS AND JAEGER

     Epps notices Jaeger just sitting there.

                          EPPS
                What are you doing? 

                          JAEGER 
                What does it look like I'm doing? 

                          EPPS 
                It looks like you're not doing anything. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything,
                because there's nothing down here. 

                          EPPS
                Get up and dig.

                          JAEGER 
                We've been digging.  We've been digging
                for hours.  If there was anything here to
                find we would have found it. 

                          EPPS 
                Get up off your ass and dig! 

     Sounding defeated as all hell, and very whiney:

                          JAEGER 
                What's the point?  There's nothing here.
                The map's a fake.  Christ, even I see 
                that now.  We're just wasting our time.
                We might as well give up and-- 

     Epps spins.  Like a bolt of lightning he's on Jaeger,
     grabbing him up and pulling him close. 

                          EPPS 
                You listen to me.  The whole reason we're
                here is because of you and that map of 
                yours.  I didn't do all this for nothing,
                and I'm not leaving with nothing.  If you
                think for a second I'm giving up just 
                'cause you're too tired to turn over some
                dirt, then you don't know John Epps too 
                well, do you?  So you dig, and you keep
                on digging 'til I say you don't have to
                dig anymore.

     Epps pushes Jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard.
     A fire burns inside him.  A fire that burns out of control.
     Before he even knows what he's doing Jaeger springs to his
     feet, shovel in hand, bringing it down in a long arc for
     Epps' head.

     Epps bears him coming.  He deftly side steps the blow, grabs
     hold of Jaeger and forces him down.  They roll around
     violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the
     other into a choke hold. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     WES 

     He can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down.

                          WES
                What are you doing...?  What the hell are
                you doing down there? 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS AND JAEGER 

     They fight on; down and dirty.  Locked together they roll
     around the ground, each trying to get the upper hand.  They
     smash into the lantern, sending the cave into near darkness.
     At the same time Epps works himself on top of Jaeger.  He
     lands a couple of solid punches, takes a rock from the ground 
     and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into Jaeger's
     skull.  All Jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow. 

     Something catches Epps' eye:  A glint of light flashes across
     his faces.  He stares at it; at an opening, a bare seem
     really, in the side of the cave wall where light seeps 
     through.  The rock slips from his hand.  Forgetting all about
     Jaeger Epps goes to the opening.  Jaeger himself, as if what
     just happened hadn't really happened, comes up along side
     Epps.

                          JAEGER 
                Must be a compartment. 

                          EPPS 
                I feel air.  Probably opens up outside 
                somewhere.  That's where the light comes 
                from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon. 

     Jaeger says what they both must have guessed by now. 

                          JAEGER 
                The white dot; light in the dark. 

     That's all Epps needs to hear.  He starts clawing at the
     opening with his bare hands.  That gets him nothing. 
     Grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it.  Jaeger gets 
     the lantern working again, then picks up his shovel and joins
     in.  They keep hitting and hitting, picking up a rhythm like
     a southern chain gang. 

                          JAEGER (CONT)
                Maybe we should blast it loose with the
                claymore. 

                          EPPS
                It's giving. 

     The rock gives way enough for Epps to pry it free.  There's
     just enough space for a man to reach his arm through.  For a
     beat Epps and Jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid
     of what mayor may not be in there.

     With some trepidation Epps begins to move his hand towards 
     the opening.  Slowly it extends closer...closer...  Just as
     it moves beyond the opening. vThere is a wild, screeching 
     hiss as some small, hairy thing leaps for Epps.

     Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear. 

                          JAEGER
                Jesus Christ! 

     Jaeger grabs up his M-16 and takes aim at...whatever it is.

                          EPPS 
                No, don't shoot! 

     Too late. Jaeger squeezes off a few rounds.  A couple of
     bullets hit the thing, but the rest ricochet wildly about the
     cave and around Epps and Jaeger.  All the two men can do is
     duck and cover - squeezing themselves into tight, fetal balls
     - as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of
     random death. 

     Eventually the bullets lose speed and die off.  Jaeger and
     Epps raise up off the ground.  They walk to the dead thing
     that jumped from the opening.

                          EPPS 
                It's just a mongoose. 

                          JAEGER
                Is it dead? 

                          EPPS
                Yeah, Bwana, you got it.

     Yelling down 

                          WES 
                What the hell are you doing!?

     EPPS AND JAEGER 

                          JAEGER 
                I think we found something. 

     They go back to the opening.  Epps shines a light inside to
     make sure there are no more surprises, then reaches an arm
     in.  Jaeger looks on with great anticipation, licking his
     lips like a hungry jackal, as Epps twists his arm in the
     opening.  Searching...searching... 

     Epps' face freezes.  He goes perfectly still for a beat, then
     slowly draws his hand from the opening.  It clutches a wooden
     box.  It is similar to Jaeger's puzzle box, but slightly
     bigger.  The instant Epps sets the box on the ground Jaeger
     smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood.  From
     the splinters pours a river of gold coins.  Jaeger and Epps
     are too stunned to do anything but look at it. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     He leans over the crevice.

                          WES
                What is it?  What'd you find?

     Incredulous himself:

                          EPPS 
                Gold.  It's gold.

     Jaeger yells it at the top of his lungs:

                          JAEGER
                IT'S GOLD! 

                                                            CUT TO:

     WES 

     His lips flutter a bit before they land on the word 

                          WES
                Gold... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EPPS AND JAEGER 

     They scoop up handfuls of the coins and let them run through
     their fingers.

                          JAEGER 
                It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And
                it's heavier than I imagined. 

                          EPPS 
                I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this.
                Not in my whole life did I ever imagine
                this. 

                          JAEGER 
                You don't have to imagine it.  Not 
                anymore.  Now all you've got to think up 
                is what it's going to buy you.

     Epps grabs up one coin and stands.

                          EPPS
                Wes! 

     With all his strength Epps gives the coin an underhanded toss
     straight up.

     WES 

     Wes catches the coin.  He turns it over in his fingers.  He
     smiles, and there's nothing pleasant about it.

                                                            CUT TO:

     JAEGER AND EPPS

     Epps yells up. 

                          EPPS 
                Wes, thrown down a pack.

     A beat later an empty pack comes falling down.  Epps picks it
     up and takes it over to Jaeger.  The two of them start
     loading the coins into it. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                I don't think the line will take the
                weight of a man and the coins.
                     (Yelling up.) 
                Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me
                and Jaeger'll climb back.

                          WES(O.C.)
                Ready when you are. 

     Epps is just about to attach the pack of gold to the line
     when Jaeger grabs his arm. 

                          JAEGER
                Wait. 

                          EPPS
                What? 

     Jaeger isn't sure how to say what he's thinking. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                What? 

                          JAEGER 
                We send the gold up what's to stop him 
                from taking off and leaving us down here? 

                          EPPS 
                He's not going to leave us. 

                          JAEGER 
                What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All
                he has to do is cut the line...

     Good point.  What is to stop him? 

                          WES
                You ready? 

                          EPPS
                     (To Jaeger) 
                All right.  I'll go up, then you send up
                the gold and-- 

                          JAEGER 
                Why do I have to stay down here? 

                          EPPS
                Jesus, Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't see how that plan's any better.

                          EPPS 
                Someone's got to send the gold up.  It
                can't get on the line by itself. 

                          JAGER 
                Why's it got to be me? 

     A tense moment passes.

                          WES
                What are you doing?  You ready? 

     Another moment, then:

                          EPPS 
                All right.  You go up, I'll send up the
                gold, then follow. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work. 

     Jaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on.  He's just
     about ready to climb up when Epps stops him.  Serious as a
     heart attack he says:

                          EPPS 
                If you're even thinking about leaving me
                down here, you better think again. 

     Jaeger stares at Epps for a beat, then laughs himself a
     little laugh.  He yells up:

                          JAEGER 
                Wes, I'm coming up.

     Jaeger starts to climb as Wes helps out by pulling on the 
     rope. 

     Epps watches him for a bit, then looks at the pack of gold
     and the rest of the equipment.  Suddenly he scurries about
     gathering up all the things they've brought down.

     Jaeger continues his climb, disappearing up into the crevice.
     A few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from, 
     above.  Epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to
     the rope.  Yelling up:

                          EPPS
                Okay! 

     The rope goes taught, slowly drawing the pack up, up into the
     crevice finally to be swallowed from view. 

     Epps waits for the rope to come back down.  He waits.  He
     waits a beat more.  No rope. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Wes?  Jaeger? 

     He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it
     creeps in anyway.  He tries it again.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Jaeger? 

     Still more nothing.  What's that sound?  It's Epps' breath
     getting heavier and faster. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Jaeger!? 

     Nothing.  Then something.  The rope snakes its way back down.
     Epps can't help but let go of a little laugh, like a guy
     who's just been given a scare by his own shadow.  Taking up 
     his own pack Epps hooks up, then starts the climb to the top.

                                                            CUT TO:

     JAEGER AND WES 

     They work the rope, helping Epps up.  He gets to the lip of
     the crevice, and pulls himself over.  He's breathing hard,
     and lets his pack slide to the ground.  Trying not to sound
     too rattled.

                          EPPS 
                What the hell took so long.

                          JAEGER 
                Just had to get the pack unhooked from
                the line.  It didn't seem that long.

                          EPPS 
                Not when you're up here with the gold, I
                guess not. 

     Throwing Epps' own words back at him: 

                          WES 
                Not losing trust, are you? 

     Epps lets this go.

                          EPPS 
                It'll be too dark to make our way back
                now.  Let's bed down for the night and
                head out at first light. 

                          WES 
                What about the gold? 

                          EPPS
                What about it? 

                          WES 
                Maybe we should split it up now. 

                          EPPS 
                We started this together, and we're 
                staying together, so there's no point in
                splitting things up now. 

                          WES 
                What if we get separated?  Way I see it
                if something happens I want to be
                carrying my share.

                          JAEGER 
                Wes might be right about that. 

                          EPPS 
                It stays as it is.  We're halfway home
                now.  Let's not blow it by people getting 
                ideas. 

                          WES 
                You're the one with all the ideas.

                          EPPS 
                You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.

                          WES 
                Maybe you've got ideas of your own for
                the gold.  Maybe you've already got
                things worked out.

                          EPPS
                Maybe I do.

                          WES 
                Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I
                can do better on my own. 

     Epps sees trouble coming, and deals with it the only way he
     knows how.  Casually he turns from Wes as if he's about to
     let things go.  Suddenly he spins back around throwing a
     punch to Wes' jaw that sends him to the ground.

     Wes puts a hand to his mouth.  It comes back stained red.
     Wes goes on the boil. 

                          WES(CONT)
                You got no reason to do that!

                          EPPS 
                I told you:  When I straighten someone 
                out they stay straightened.  This is how
                it works:  Nobody touches the gold.
                Except when we're on the move and 
                someone's carrying it, nobody so much as
                opens the pack to get an eyeful of it.
                Agreed? 

     Jaeger wastes no time jumping in. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  Sure.  That sounds like a plan to
                me. 

     Wes, still on the ground, fumes. 

                          WES 
                You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting
                tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around. 

                          EPPS
                Then get up and do something about it.

     Wes thinks about it, but that's all he does.  He's not ready
     to cross that line yet. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Then just lay there and bleed. 

     Epps takes up his pack and moves off to bed down.  Jaeger
     does the same.  Wes just lays on the ground...and bleeds.

                                                           FADE TO:

     BLACK

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. MESA - EARLY MORNING 

     The first light of day barely begins to fight its way through
     the dark.  Our boys sleep in a circle around the pack filled
     with gold.  Surprisingly they seem to sleep pretty well, but
     then the last twenty-four hours has taken a lot out of them.

     There is a slight sound: Rocks crunching underneath a foot.
     Someone stirs, someone moves.  It's hard to tell who it is in 
     this bad light.  They creep towards the pack, inching their
     way closer and closer.  They reach out a hand, just about to
     grab the pack.

     Wes, who obviously wasn't asleep at all, lunges for the 
     person, and takes them down hard.  There's the ugly crunch of
     body against stone as they hit the ground.  M-16 in hand Wes
     straddles the intruder pressing the muzzle of the rifle
     against his head. 

                          WES 
                Stay down.  Stay the hell down, or I will
                rip your stinking head off! 

     Underneath him, an IRAQI SOLDIER - who already looks very
     badly injured; bloody, cut, slightly burned - babbles back in
     high pitched and frightened Arabic.

     This is enough to wake Jaeger and Epps. 

                          JAGER
                What the hell?

                          WES 
                I caught him!  I caught him trying to
                steal the gold. 

                          EPPS
                Get off him. 

                          WES 
                     (Slightly crazed) 
                He snuck in here thinking we were asleep,
                only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit
                our throats if I hadn't stopped him. 

                          EPPS
                Get off him! 

     Epps reaches down and physically pulls Wes from the soldier
     who still rattles on. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                What happened?

                          WES 
                I told you.  He tried to steal our gold.
                He tried to kill us.

                          JAEGER 
                With what?  He doesn't have a weapon. 

                          WES 
                He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a 
                weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare
                hands. 

     The soldier goes on babbling.  Wes has had just about enough
     of that.  He gives the soldier a kick to the ribs. 

                          WES(CONT)
                Shut up! 

     Epps gives Wes a hard push. 

                          EPPS
                Stop it! 

                          WES 
                I told you; don't push me around. 

     Even now, frightened but more calmly, the soldier goes on.

                          EPPS 
                Tell me what he's saying.

     Wes listens, but with disdain.  He translates:

                          WES 
                Says he's one of the soldiers that was in
                the helicopter. 

                          JAEGER 
                He lived through that? 

     The soldier goes on, and so does Wes.

                          WES 
                Says they were deserters, they were 
                afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam
                anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to
                hide out.  When they saw us they figured
                we were going to kill them, so they shot
                first. 

                          EPPS 
                Why'd he come in our camp. 

     Wes asks him the question in Arabic and gets an answer.  It's
     enough to give Wes a bit of a laugh. 

                          WES 
                Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted
                the gold. 

                          EPPS 
                How's he going to want the gold?  He
                couldn't even know we had it.

                          WES 
                He...he could have been watching us.

                          JAEGER 
                Maybe we should give him some water. 

                          WES 
                All last night he could have been-- 

                          JAEGER 
                I think he wants something to drink. 

                          WES 
                I'm not wasting my water on him. 

     Jaeger gets his water and gives some to the soldier.

                          WES(CONT) 
                I don't care what he says, he wanted our
                gold.  Would have slit our throats if he
                had the chance.

                          EPPS 
                Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he 
                didn't get it.  We've got no need staying
                around here.  It's light enough.  Let's
                pack up and head out. 

     Jaeger and Epps start to go for their gear.  Wes is still on
     the Iraqi soldier.

                          WES 
                What about him?  We...we have to do
                something.

     Epps gives an expression that screams:  What the hell are you
     talking about?

                          WES(CONT) 
                We can't just leave him.  He'll run back
                to his outfit, report our position... 

                          EPPS 
                You said he was a deserter. 

                          WES 
                That's what he says.  He could be a spy,
                or something. 

                          EPPS 
                You don't know that. 

                          WES
                You don't know he isn't. 

                          JAEGER 
                So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til
                we get back to the Hummer. 

                          WES 
                He'd just slow us down, and drink our
                water.  And if we ran into any more
                Iraqis you know he'd sell us out. 

                          EPPS 
                We don't leave him, we don't take him
                with us.  What does that leave? 

     By way of answering Wes lifts his M-16 and works the action.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You're out of your mind.

                          WES 
                He's an enemy soldier.

                          EPPS 
                I'm not going to let you kill him.

                          WES
                We're at war. 

     The discussion starts to get real heated.

                          EPPS 
                We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger
                are AWOL.  We have no authority-- 

                          WES 
                He tried to kill us.  If not just now,
                then in the helicopter.  That's all the
                authority I need. 

     Jaeger goes somewhere near panic.

                          JAEGER
                We don't need to do this.  We got the 
                gold, all right?  Let's just get out of
                here. 

     The Iraqi may not speak the language, but he's got a pretty
     good idea what they are arguing about.  He starts to plead
     for his life

                          WES 
                I'm not going to leave him be just so he
                can stab us in the backs the minute we
                turn around.  I have been through too
                much to lose it all now just because the
                two of you don't have the stomach to do
                what has to be done. 

                          EPPS 
                I've got no stomach for murder. 

                          WES 
                It's a combat action. 

                          EPPS 
                It's murder, and I won't be any part of
                it. 

                          WES 
                Then step aside. 

                          EPPS
                No. 

                          WES 
                Get out of my way. 

     The Iraqis begging goes into over drive.  Jaeger just about
     loses it.

                          JAEGER 
                For Christ's sake, we don't need this.
                Let's just go.  Let's just...let's just
                get out of here. 

     Wes yells down at the Iraqi. 

                          WES 
                Shut up!  Shut the hell up! 

     Wes moves menacingly for the Iraqi.  He thrusts his M-16
     forward.  Epps grabs it, and throws a punch.  Unlike before 
     with Jaeger, this time Wes ducks the blow and swings the butt
     of the M-16 back at Epps.  It's not much of a blow though, 
     and Epps keeps on coming.  He barrels into Wes and takes him
     down. 

     As the two men tussle the Iraqi sees his chance to get away.
     He springs up, knocking Jaeger to the side, and bolts past
     him.

                          JAGER 
                He's getting away! 

     Epps turns and sees this.  Maybe he's not for killing this 
     guy, but he certainly can't just let him get away.  He takes
     off running after the Iraqi, Jaeger a step behind. 

     The Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like
     a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to 
     climb to the plateau above.  He knows if he can make it he at
     least has a chance of getting away.  It shows in the
     desperation he climbs with. 

     Epps and Jaeger are right behind him.  They claw at the
     rocks, but can't gain ground.

     The Iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau; to freedom.
     Our two soldiers scramble up right behind him.

     The Iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau.  He's just
     about to pull himself up.  He's just about to get away-- 

     WE HEAR A SHORT BURST OF GUNFIRE.  Three large, bloody holes
     mushroom open in the Iraqi's back.

                                                            CUT TO:

     WES 

     He stands, smoke curling from the muzzle of his M-16 like a 
     white snake, having just send the Iraqi some bullets special
     delivery. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE IRAQI 

     He arches, stiffens, then falls like a stone past Epps and
     Jaeger to the ground below like a sack of potatoes.

     As the two climb down Wes goes to the body and stands over it
     like the great, white hunter standing over his kill.  All
     business like he says:

                          WES 
                I had to.  You saw how he ran.  Would
                have given us away.  I had to. 

     There's a beat of quiet, then: 

                          JAEGER 
                Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him.
                Say some words over him. 

                          WES 
                You want to say some words? 

     He sneers down at the body.

                          WES(CONT) 
                Go to hell.  How are those words? 

     Wes moves off.  A beat later Jaeger walks away.  Epps just
     stands there looking at the body. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. MESA - LATER 

     Wes, Epps and Jaeger are making the trek back down.  Jaeger 
     is shouldering the pack with the gold.  Wes has got his M-16. 
     Epps stops, and puts his pack down.  He takes out the navicom
     and a recon photo. 

                          EPPS
                We should head Northeast. 

                          JAEGER 
                Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer;
                further into Iraqi.

                          EPPS 
                There's another pass on the photo.  We 
                can avoid that narrow one we had to cross
                on the way up, and it should get us back
                down. 

                          JAEGER 
                It should, or it will?  Least going back
                the way we came we know what we're up
                against. 

                          EPPS 
                You think you can make that pass weighted
                down when you almost fell the first time
                you're wrong, and you're not going to 
                take my share of the gold with you trying
                it.  We're heading Northeast. 

     Really calm, cold and direct Wes says:

                          WES
                You've got an awful lot of orders in you.
                Always giving orders. 

                          EPPS 
                I out rank you, that's why. 

                          WES 
                In the service you do, but we're not 
                particularly in the service right now.
                Way I see it, what we're doing, that 
                doesn't particularly give you the right
                to toss orders around. 

     Epps loads up his pack pretty much ignoring Wes. 

                          EPPS 
                We been down this road.  I told you how
                it is.  Unless you feel like there's
                something you want to do about it... 

                          WES
                What if I do? 

     Epps says nothing, so Wes tries it again a little harder. 

                          WES(CONT)
                What if I do? 

     He works the action of his M-16. 

                          WES(CONT) 
                You talk loud, and don't even have a big
                stick to back it up with. 

     Real casual Epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the
     pin loose.  He stands with the grenade in one hand and the
     navicom in the other.  Real calm, like he was talking about
     the weather:

                          EPPS 
                Something happens to me I let go of this
                grenade.  I go, and I take the navicom
                with me.  And how do you suppose you're 
                going to find your way back to the Hummer,
                when you won't even know what's up or 
                down.  It's a big country, and you could
                be heading for the allies, or wandering 
                right into Bhagdad.  That's if you don't
                die of thirst before you even get that
                far.  How you like my stick now? 

     Epps and Wes have a stare down.  Jaeger, who's getting really
     good at freaking out, jumps in. 

                          JAEGER 
                Why don't you put the gun down, all 
                right, Wes?  You put the gun down and 
                Epps'll put the pin back in the grenade.
                Won't you Epps? 

     The stare down goes on a beat longer.  Finally Wes lowers his
     rifle.  He turns to Jaeger and vents what anger he can. 

                          WES 
                I'm starting to think you're a real
                bitch, you know that?

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     THE CAMERA PANS over the vast expanse of nothingness.  SMOKE 
     BEGINS TO DRIFT INTO FRAME.  THE CAMERA FINALLY LANDS ON THE
     SHI'ITE ENCAMPMENT, or at least what's left of it.  Tents are
     torn down and burned, goods scattered.  It looks like a ghost
     town.  Epps, Wes and Jaeger wander into it.  They look
     around, but see no signs of life. 

     Wes grabs up some Shi'ite garments, white robes, and starts
     to put them on. 

                          JAEGER 
                You're going to burn up in those. 

                          WES 
                The white reflects the sun; it keeps you
                cooler.  That's why they wear them. 

     Jaeger looks to Epps who just shrugs.  Jaeger gets some robes
     and puts them on.  Epps follows suit. 

                          JAEGER 
                Think the Iraqi's killed them all?

                          WES 
                Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest.
                Murderers. 

                          EPPS
                     (Pointed) 
                Murder, or a combat action?  It's hard to
                tell them apart? 

     They keep on moving, passing straight through the camp.  Epps
     marches ahead, not wanting to even deal with the other two 
     men.  Wes talks after him.  Really he talks more to himself,
     and he's not sounding too lucid. 

                          WES 
                You saw how he ran didn't you?  First
                chance he got he ran out.  Would have
                gone straight to his CO, told him all 
                about the gold.  What do you think would
                have happened then, huh?  Then what do 
                you think would have happened?  Two 
                thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on
                us.  You ought to thank me for killing 
                him.  I'll get a medal for it.  Watch and
                see if I don't get a medal. 

     Epps isn't even paying attention, he's just walking on. 
     Almost, as if he senses something is wrong, he stops in his
     tracks.  He looks down at his feet and sees the most curious
     thing.  SAND IS RUSHING AWAY FROM HIS FEET, ALMOST AS IF IT'S
     GOING DOWN A DRAIN.  He looks at it with the same wonderment
     that a dog watches television. 

                          EPPS 
                What the hell...? 

     Epps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a
     moment later the Earth literally drops from beneath his feet.
     He's standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in
     loose sand.  Immediately he sinks to waist level.  He slows
     there, but still goes down with rapidity.  He screams to 
     Jaeger and Wes.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Help!  Help me! 

     Jaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole.  Wes
     doesn't move. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Help me!

     Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision.  He doesn't want to let
     Epps drown, but if he gets too close he could easily get 
     sucked into.  He flirts back and forth between rescue and
     safety. 

     Sand continues to pour in on Epps. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                For Christ's Sake, Jaeger!  Help me!
                Help me! 

     Jaeger can't fight himself any longer.  He lowers himself
     halfway into the hole, stretching spread eagle trying to keep
     some kind of grip on the firmer ground, and reaches for Epps. 

     Their arms twist and strain for each others.  First their 
     fingers meet, then they grab hands.  They work a grip down to
     their wrist, but that's all they can get.  Jaeger strains 
     like a field horse pulling Epps against the sand.  It may not
     be enough as he begins to slip down himself.  Jaeger twists
     his head and looks up at Wes.  Straining to say anything he
     pleads: 

                          JAEGER
                Wes...Wes! 

     His words fall on deaf ears.  Wes just takes a step closer to
     the pack of gold coins. 

     This only serves to energize Jaeger.  He digs deeper within
     himself finding an untapped reserve of strength.  He grunts
     and pulls, the veins on his neck puffing like balloons. 

     Epps finds same purchase.  He pulls, swims, his way up from
     the sand.  A little at first, but like hitting shallow water
     he's able to lift himself up. 

     Jager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground.  They
     collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air. 

     As Epps regains strength he pats himself down.  Suddenly he
     goes back into a panic. 

                          EPPS
                The navicom!

     Epps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft
     sand frantically looking for the lost computer.  Jaeger joins
     in.  They dig and scrape as best they can, but daring to
     venture only so far into the soft sand.  It doesn't matter.
     The navicom is lost. 

                          JAEGER 
                What are we going to do?  How are we
                going to find our way back!? 

                          EPPS 
                We'll find our way. 

                          JAEGER
                How!? 

                          EPPS 
                We'll find our way!  We'll... 

     Epps wants to say how, but he's got no idea.  Wes grows a
     smug smile. 

                          WES 
                No navicom.  A lot of good you are now,
                Epps. 

                          EPPS 
                Lot of good you were when I was sinking
                in the sand. 

                          WES 
                Without that navicam looks to me like you
                forfeit the right to be in charge. 

                          EPPS 
                And let me guess who is. 

     Wes casually slides out his M-16.

                          WES 
                I'm the one's got the big stick. 

                          EPPS 
                Suppose I don't go for that? 

                          WES 
                Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and
                I suppose I'd have to kill you.
                     (Beat)
                I suppose. 

                          EPPS 
                What about Jaeger? 

                          WES 
                Nothing about him, unless he's got a
                problem about me dealing with you. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, I got a problem with you killing Epps. 

     Wes turns and glares at Jaeger, who backs down. 

                          JAEGER(CONT}
                I mean, in principle. 

                          WES 
                     {Sneering) 
                You know, Jaeger, you really are a bitch. 

     Epps isn't wasting anymore time.  When Wes turns to glower at
     Jaeger he lunges up for him.  Wes side steps Epps and lands 
     the but of his rifle into the side of Epps' head.  It opens a
     wound, and sends Epps back down to the ground. 

     Epps looks up right into the muzzle of West M-16.  Full of
     poison: 

                          WES(CONT)
                You die! 

     Wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot 
     rings out.  Wes' body jerks like he's just been hit in the
     back with a truck.  The way cut timber falls he slams to the
     ground motionless. 

     Epps and Jaeger stare at the body for a beat, then snap their
     heads in the direction of the shot. 

     Up on a dune behind them are a group of SHI'ITES on 
     horseback.  One of them has a high powered rifle which he has
     just used to drill Wes.  He fires another shot.  It pings to
     the ground between Epps and Jaeger. 

     Our two remaining men scramble.  Jaeger dives for the gold 
     and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it.
     The two take off running as best they can in the sand.  They
     run wildly, erratically, without looking back.  They run
     until their bodies scream no more, then keep going on 
     inertia.  Reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and
     collapse in a heap at the bottom.  They take a moment to
     catch what breath they can, then: 

                          EPPS 
                We got to go back.  We got to go back for
                Wes. 

                          JAEGER
                Forget Wes. 

                          EPPS
                We can't just leave him. 

                          JAEGER
                Wes is dead! 

                          EPPS 
                What if he's not? 

                          JAEGER 
                Then he will be when those Iraqis get to
                him.  He was going to kill you.  He was 
                one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps,
                and I'm sure as hell not getting my head
                blow off over his carcass. 

     They sit there trying to catch their breath.  As they do a
     sound comes from the distance.  They freeze, ears cocked,
     trying to figure out what it is. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                It's a helicopter. 

     Quickly, desperately, as the sound of the chopter draws 
     closer, they scan the horizon looking for it.  Jaeger spots
     it and thrusts a finger in its direction. 

                          JAGER(CONT)
                There. 

     Epps scrambles out his binoculars.  He targets the
     helicopter.  Jaeger waits in high anticipation. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Ours, or theirs? 

     Epps can't make out for sure.  Jaeger asks again with growing
     anxiety. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                Ours, or theirs?

     Epps takes a long, hard stare.

                          EPPS 
                Ours.  It's one of ours.  We've got to
                signal them; let them know we're down
                here. 

     The instant Jaeger hears this his face twists up like he's
     thinking something, and he doesn't like what it is he's
     thinking.  Quietly, almost to himself: 

                          JAEGER
                No.

                          EPPS 
                We need something:  A flare, a signal
                mirror. 

     Again Jaeger says it, this time including Epps too. 

                          JAEGER
                No. 

                          EPPS 
                What do you mean no?  They can fly us home. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                They'll ask questions; want to know why
                we were out here. 

                          EPPS
                We'll lie. 

                          JAEGER 
                They'll search the pack. 

     Epps finds a mirror in one of his pockets.  He stands, ready
     to signal the chopter. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                They'll find the gold. 

     Epps turns sharply back to Jaeger.

                          EPPS 
                We're lost, you understand that?  We've
                got no navicom, and no means to find a
                way back.  So right now I don't give a 
                damn about the gold because if we don't 
                get off this desert, and out of Iraqi all
                it's going to be good for is buying us
                tombstones. 

     Epps is back around ready to signal the helicopter.  He's
     about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an M-16
     action being worked.  Epps turns to face Jaeger. 

                          JAEGER 
                I can't do it, Epps.  Not when we're so 
                close.  I can't let you ruin everything. 

     Epps just stares at Jaeger, not frightened, but surprisingly
     calm.

                          EPPS 
                First Wes, now you? 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.

                          EPPS 
                     (Sarcastic) 
                And you; you've got it all together. 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't 
                kill you just to kill you, but I can't 
                let you lose the gold for me.  Not when
                we're so close. 

                          EPPS 
                That helicopter passes, and the only
                thing we're close to is death. 

     Jaeger is unfazed.  Very politely he says:

                          JAEGER
                Sit down, Epps. 

     Epps takes him up on the offer.  What choice does he have?
     THE CAMERA STAYS TIGHT ON THE TWO MEN.  They don't talk.
     They don't move.  They just sit as WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE
     HELICOPTER GETTING CLOSER AND LOUDER.  IT REACHES A
     CRESCENOO, THEN BEGINS TO FADE UNTIL IT DISAPPEARS.  The
     chopter is gone, along with Epps and Jaeger's best chance of 
     getting out of the desert alive. 

     Jaeger lowers his rifle.  Very genuinely he says:

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I'm sorry about that, Epps. 

                          EPPS
                Is it all right if I stand up? 

     Like he didn't know he was keeping Epps from something. 

                          JAEGER 
                Oh, yeah.  Go ahead. 

     Epps stands.  He looks around trying to figure things out. 
     Not much to figure.  There still in the middle of a desert in
     a hostile country same as they ever were. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm
                glad it didn't come to that. 

                          EPPS 
                Yeah.  Well, me too. 

                          JAEGER 
                I never killed anybody before.  I talk a
                good game, but I'm not like that. 

                          EPPS
                Sure. 

                          JAEGER 
                Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was 
                talking I wanted to blow away all those
                Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I
                was scared out of my mind to go to war.
                I still haven't gotten over stepping on
                that land mine. 

                          EPPS 
                You still got a map on you? 

                          JAEGER
                What?  Yeah. 

     Jaeger takes out the maps he has and hands them to Epps. 
     Epps looks them over, then looks over the terrain.  Without
     any landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be
     finger paintings.

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Epps? 

                          EPPS
                Yeah. 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't want to die. 

                          EPPS 
                Makes two of us. 

                          JAEGER 
                I know what I did just now was crazy, but
                you got to understand how much I want
                that gold. 

                          EPPS 
                It's all right.  I don't like it, but
                it's over now. 

                          JAEGER 
                I never had anything before, Epps.  I
                never was anybody.  Not the kind of 
                somebody you can be with a pocket full of
                gold coins.  When I was in high school I 
                used to-- 

     Fed up with Jaeger Epps turns on him hard.

                          EPPS 
                Hey, you know what?  Can I be honest with
                you?  Right now I'm not all that 
                interested in how you're messed up 'cause
                you didn't get the bicycle you wanted for
                your thirteenth birthday.  What I'm 
                interested in is how I can keep from
                getting dead.  And listening to sob 
                stories from some           about how the
                system wasn't good to him because he had
                to work like everybody else instead of
                being born a Kennedy doesn't do a damn 
                thing to help keep me alive.  So do me a 
                favor; either shut up, or...just shut up. 

     Jaeger isn't sure what to say. 

                          JAEGER
                Sorry. 

                          EPPS 
                Damn. 

     Epps sits down in the sand, all out of ideas.  There's a long
     quiet before Jaeger says:

                          JAEGER 
                What do you think our chances are? 

                          EPPS 
                If we can find the Hummer, or some 
                friendlies by sundown we might be okay. 
                We've got enough water for that.  But we
                won't make another day otherwise. 

     Again they sit for a beat.

                          JAEGER
                Wonder how the war's going? 

                          EPPS 
                It's got to be going better than this.. 

     Epps stands and has a last look around. 

                          EPPS{CONT) 
                All right.  pick a direction. 

     Jaeger just gives a surprised look. 

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                We can't just sit here.  We've got to
                start moving, so pick. 

                          JAEGER 
                You sure you want me too? 

     Epps nods.  Jaeger stands and takes a good look around.  He
     considers things, although there isn't much to consider.
     Finally he decisively points in a direction. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                I pick that way. 

                          EPPS 
                Okay.  Then we go this way. 

     Epps heads off in the opposite direction. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     Epps and Jaeger make the long march across the sand.  There's
     so much nothing out there it's maddening. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - LATER 

     Epps drops down in the sand.  He lets his pack slide fram his 
     back, then pulls his water and takes a healthy swig.  He puts
     his pack back on and struggles to his feet.  As Jaeger
     crosses he takes Epps by the shoulder and helps to pull him
     up.  The two wade on. 

                                                           FADE TO:

     EXT. DESERT - EVENING 

     Epps and Jaeger are trekking as they have been doing all day. 
     They look worn out, but they keep moving.  Jaeger is several
     paces behind Epps. 

                          JAEGER
                Getting cold.

                          EPPS 
                It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at
                night; they get cold. 

                          JAEGER 
                Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a
                second. 

                          EPPS
                No! 

                          JAEGER 
                Just let me rest for a second. 

                          EPPS 
                We've got to keep moving while there's
                still light. 

                          JAEGER 
                You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just
                going to take a second.  I want to look
                at the gold. 

                          EPPS 
                Don't you touch it. 

                          JAEGER 
                I just want to look at it.  Remind me of
                what I'm dying for. 

                          EPPS 
                The deal was no one touches it until we
                get out of here. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was
                still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new
                deal. 

     Jaeger takes the pack from his back and starts to open it.
     Epps turns and races back to him grabbing him by the wrist
     and forcing Jaeger to let go of the pack. 

                          EPPS 
                You listen to me.  If, if we get out of
                this I don't care what you do with your 
                share, but until then you've only got one
                thing to think about and that's staying 
                alive.  So you leave that gold alone, or
                you and I are going to have to have a
                serious talk. 

     Epps waits for a response from Jaeger, but gets none. 

     Jaeger's eyes seem to be glazed, and his stare fixed on a
     point well beyond Epps.  He raises a hand, points off into 
     the distance. 

                          JAEGER
                Look. 

     Epps turns and looks.  Off a ways is a light in the window of
     what looks to be a shack-type building.  Epps stares at it as
     if it were the holy Grail 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                What do you figure it is? 

                          EPPS 
                Place all alone like that?  Must be a
                boarder check point. 

                          JAEGER 
                Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria? 

                          EPPS 
                Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone
                that far north.  It's got to be Saudi.
                Come on. 

     Epps heads for the shack doing double time.  Jaeger puts the
     pack back on and races to catch up. 

                          EPPS(CONT} 
                They've got to have water.  We'll get 
                same water, some directions, maybe they
                even have a vehicle. 

                          JAEGER
                Epps. 

                          EPPS 
                We can head back for our lines, and they
                don't even have to know about the gold. 

                          JAEGER 
                Epps.  What if they're not Saudi. 

     Epps stops dead, now not more than one hundred meters from
     the shack. 

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                If it's a checkpoint, it could be Iraqi. 

     Epps considers this.

                          EPPS 
                We've got no cboice.  Either way, we've
                got no choice. 

     Epps and Jaeger keep on for the shack walking with
     apprehension now instead of running.  Epps stops less than
     fifty meters away. 

                          JAEGER
                Well? 

                          EPPS 
                Well, we should identify ourselves. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, I guess we should. 

     Epps takes in a deep breath ready to yell to the shack.
     Instead he turns to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS 
                Even if they are Iraqis probably all
                they'll do is take us prisoner for
                awhile.  Got to figure we're still 
                kicking their asses in the war.  They
                don't want any trouble.

                          JAEGER 
                Hell, they'll probably just surrender to
                us.  Probably. 

     Again Epps takes a deep breath.  And again just as he's about 
     to cry out he turns to Jaeger. 

                          EPPS
                That's if the war is even still going on.
                Way things were shaping up it's probably
                long over. 

                          JAEGER
                Probably. 

     Epps takes a beat, then sucks in a breath.  He yells for the
     shack: 

                          EPPS
                Hellooooo-- 

     Before Epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun 
     fire erupts from the house and burns towards Epps and Jaeger.
     They dive for cover, hugging the ground as bullets whistle 
     and ping through the space around them.  They are forced back
     and down against a narrow stretch of rock, but it offers 
     little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead.  It's 
     just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them
     and death.  At the top of his lungs Jaeger starts yelling: 

                          JAEGER 
                Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib!  Ashra Ka
                mahari dahra sahib!

     Just as quickly as it began the shooting stops.  From the
     shack we hear some chatter in Arabic, then the door opens.  A
     few MEN appear in the doorway.  They laugh and beckon for
     Epps and Jaeger to join them. 

                          EPPS 
                What did you say? 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't know.  Something Wes had taught
                me.  I think it means "Don't shoot.
                We're your friends." 

                          EPPS 
                They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi 
                checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on.
                Come on! 

     Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.  Jaeger is
     just steps behind him. 

     They enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the FOUR
     men inside.  Epps and Jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and
     go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on
     chattering behind them. 

                          JAGER 
                Oh, man, this is good.  What do you think
                the chances are they've got a whirlpool
                in this place? 

     As they rub their hands together Epps looks up.  He freezes.
     Hanging on the wall is a very handsome, nicely framed 
     portrait of Saddam Hussein.  Epps nudges Jaeger who also
     looks up.  He also freezes. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Oh, God... 

                          EPPS 
                They must have thought we were Iraqi when
                you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell
                in the dark. 

                          JAEGER
                What are we going to do? 

     Epps thinks.  What are they going to do?

                          EPPS 
                Slip out your M-16. 

                          JAEGER
                And then what? 

                          EPPS 
                And then shoot them. 

                          JAEGER 
                I...I never killed anyone before.  I told
                you that. 

                          EPPS 
                Well, you're going to start with a bang,
                'cause you've got four of them to take down. 

     Behind Epps and Jaeger one of the Iraqis asks a question of
     them in Arabic. 

                          JAEGER 
                Can't you-- 

                          EPPS 
                I don't have a weapon. 

     Again the Iraqi asks the question.  We can tell by the tone
     of his voice he expects an answer. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going
                to kill me.  Kill them! 

                          JAEGER 
                I just said I would.  I don't think I-- 

                          EPPS
                Shoot them! 

     The Iraqis sense that something is wrong.  They move
     menacingly for their weapons. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Shoot them, Jaeger!  SHOOT THEM! 

     Jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his M-16.  He 
     jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth, back 
     and forth. 

     Dig it:  The Iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of 
     the muzzle flashes.  They do the twist, they do the jerk,
     then they all fall down. 

     The bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the
     place; shredding walls, eating up wood. 

     Jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty.  He stands 
     huffing, eyes glazed like he's a million miles away from what
     he just did.  Epps steps up and takes the weapon from Jaeger.
     That's like an alarm clock that brings Jaeger back to the 
     land of the living.  Jaeger takes one look around at all the
     carnage, then doubles over and gets to puking. 

     Epps just watches this pathetic sight.  When Jaeger is all
     done: 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Let's get some sleep. 

                                                           FADE TO: 

     BLACK 

                                                           FADE TO:

     INT. SHACK - MORNING 

     The sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as 
     Jaeger comes awake.  The second he does he sees a MAN - Arab,
     wearing white robes - peering through the window.  Jaeger 
     gives a start, and the man disappears.  Jaeger quickly shakes
     Epps awake. 

                          JAEGER 
                Epp...Epps!  There's someone at the
                window!

     This wakes Epps up quick. 

                          EPPS
                An Iraqi? 

                          JAEGER 
                I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform 
                on.  He...he had on white robes, like the
                guys who killed Wes.

     Epps does some quick figuring, then staying low, scrambles
     across the floor to one of the dead Iraqis and grabs up his
     weapon.  He grabs another one tosses it to Jaeger.

     Carefully, still low, Epps creeps over to the window.  Slowly
     he raises up and looks out. 

                          JAGER(CONT)
                See anything? 

                          EPPS
                Nothing. 

     Epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking. 

                          JAEGER
                What do we do? 

                          EPPS 
                We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't
                an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of
                time before some show up.  Get all the 
                water you can carry, and we'll head out
                on foot. 


                          JAEGER 
                To where? 

                          EPPS 
                Sun rises in the East.  We go the
                opposite direction.  May not find 
                anything, but at least we'll know we're
                heading towards Saudi Arabia. 

     As Jaeger gathers up what water he can find, creeps for
     the door.  With the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a
     crack and peers out.  Still nothing.  It's like the man
     vanished into thin air. 

     Jaeger, stocked up on water, comes over with the gold and
     Epps' pack which Epps shoulders.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Ready? 

     Jaeger nods.  Epps opens the door, and the two men carefully
     snake their way out weapons at the ready.  It seems, though,
     there is nothing to be ready for.  There is no one around. 

     Suddenly the man appears from around the shack.  Epps and
     Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but
     they do not fire.  The man just stands.  He doesn't say
     anything, he makes no threatening moves.  The three stay 
     still as statues for several beats until Epps jerks his head
     indicating to Jaeger they should move on.  That they do,
     weapons still on the man, until they are beyond his range.

     They walk on a little ways.  Jaeger spots something, and
     thrusts a finger in its direction.

                          JAEGER
                Look! 

     Mounted on a horse, riding on a dune that runs parallel to
     them, is ANOTHER ARAB MAN.  He makes no effort to draw nearer
     to Epps and Jaeger, but nor does he lose them.

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                What do we do? 

                          EPPS 
                We keep going, that's what we do.  We
                ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

     As if to be contrary to Epps' statement ANOTHER TWO ARABS ON
     HORSE BACK appear up over a dune before them.

                          JAEGER
                Jesus!  How many of them are there? 

     Epps doesn't know, and he doesn't want to find out.  They 
     change direction heading away from the Arabs.  But again MORE
     ARABS ride up over a dune.  Epps gets the feeling he and
     Jaeger are about to be boxed in. 

                          EPPS 
                I don't like this.  Let's go. 

     Epps breaks into a run.  Jaeger is only steps behind him. 

     Like something out of an old John Ford western dozens of 
     mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune.  They ride fast 
     and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon
     train.  They easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing
     them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if
     playing with them. 

     Epps and Jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction.  The
     Arabs ride back, again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to
     the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over
     them.  It looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the
     cattle. 

     Epps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again
     the Arabs bear down on them.  This time they mean business.
     They completely surround them, cutting off all means of 
     escape.  The Arabs start screaming something back and forth
     in Arabic.  We don't know what, but it sounds unpleasant. 

     Epps and Jaeger come skidding to a halt.  They turn in their
     tracks digging in the scene.  It goes like this:  They are
     completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force.
     Doesn't get any simpler. 

     Epps and Jaeger drop their weapons.  Their hands go in the
     air. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. SHI'ITE CAMP - LATER 

     The mounted Arabs lead Epps and Jaeger, hands tied before 
     them and almost literally being towed by the horses, into 
     their camp.  It is similar to the Shi'ite camps we've seen
     before with several tent dwellings. 

     As the party enters groups of Shi'ites come over to stare at
     Epps and Jaeger.  They chatter amongst themselves, but our 
     boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just
     makes things all the scarier.

     From our boy's point of view this is all like an unending
     nightmare:  Being dragged along through a desert, not knowing
     the language, not knowing what's going to happen.  Their 
     world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt-a-whirl. 

     Finally they reach a tent.  One of the Arabs tosses Epps and
     Jaeger's packs on the ground just before it.  Another cuts
     them loose and SHOVES THEM INSIDE THE TENT, then yells 
     something at them in Arabic.  He leaves, and our two are
     alone. 

                          JAEGER 
                What do you make of them? 

                          EPPS 
                Shi'ites, I think. 

                          JAEGER 
                Is that good, or bad? 

                          EPPS 
                I don't know.  They killed Wes. 

                          JAEGER 
                Why haven't they killed us!? 

                          EPPS
                I don't know! 

                          JAEGER 
                ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way
                out. 

                          EPPS 
                With what?  Against how many? 

                          JAEGER 
                We can't just sit here waiting to die. 

                          EPPS 
                You come up with a better plan, let me
                know. 

                          JAEGER 
                Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold.
                If we gave it to them they might let us
                live; they might not kill us. 

     From O.C. we hear a voice:

                          VOICE(O.C.)
                I always knew you were a bitch.

     Epps and Jaeger's hearts seize up and stop.  It's as if
     they've heard the voice of a ghost, and they have.  IT'S WES!
     He carries with him the pack of gold.  Epps can barely get
     his name out.

                          EPPS
                ...Wes...?

                          JAEGER
                You were shot.  We were standing right
                there, you were shot!

                          WES
                In the flack jacket.  Still like getting
                hit in the back with a baseball bat.
                Took the air right out of me, but I was
                just unconscious for awhile.  'Course,
                you didn't stick around to find that out.
                You left me for dead.

                          EPPS
                We thought--

     Like a guy who just took two steps over the edge:

                          WES
                YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD!

     Ohhh, shit.  Somebody's crazy.  Epps gets the feeling there's
     not going to be much dialog going on here.  Wes gets real
     calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts.

                          WES(CONT)
                When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had
                shot an American they were very
                apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking
                ass in this little war.  They figure
                we've finally gotten Saddam off their
                backs.  They brought me to their camp,
                cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new
                best buddy.  America number one, Joe.
                But there's something the Shi'ites can't
                figure out:  They can't figure out why my
                two buddies, two fellow Americans, left
                me out in the desert.  They can't seem to
                figure out what those same two guys were
                doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost
                as if they were Iraqi spies, or
                something.  And I've got to tell you they
                hate anything that's got to do with the
                Iraqis.  See how I mean?

                          JAEGER 
                We had to take shelter in the checkpoint.
                Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there. 

                          WES 
                You actually got around to killing 
                someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're
                only half a bitch. 

                          EPPS 
                Wes, we thought you were dead, and we 
                thought we were next.  Hanging around to
                get killed wouldn't have done anyone any
                good. 

                          WES 
                Sure, and I guess it was just convenient
                there was one less person to split the
                gold with. 

                          EPPS
                Wes-- 

                          WES 
                Look, I know you guys are telling the 
                truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know
                that.  I guess you could tell them...but 
                then you don't speak the language do you?

     Wes gets right up into Jaeger's face. 

                          WES{CONT)
                Do you!? 

     Of course Wes knows they don't.  He allows himself a very
     sweet, shit eating grin. 

                          WES{CONT) 
                They're going to kill you slow.  I'll see
                to that. 

     He steps away and starts to open the pack of gold. 

                          WES(CONT) 
                Thanks for taking care of this for me.

                          EPPS 
                Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy,
                greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says
                you're crazy. 

                          JAEGER 
                I didn't say that.  I never said-- 

                          EPPS 
                Me?  I say you don't have enough brains
                to be stupid. 

     For a second Wes is taken by surprise by the statement, but
     he smiles at Epps' boldness.  He sets down the pack of gold
     and gets right up into Epps' face. 

                          WES 
                You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured
                you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I
                had respect for you. 

                          EPPS 
                That why you tried to put a bullet in my
                head in the middle of the desert.

                          WES 
                That's just what things came to. 
                Sometimes you can't help that.  It 
                doesn't change me respecting you.  And
                now you let me down.  I expected more
                from you, you know?  I really did.  I 
                expected you to-- 

     A KNIFE SLIDES UP INTO FRAME UNTIL THE THE TIP RESTS JUST
     UNDER WES' THROAT, CHOKING OFF HIS WORDS. 

     Now it's Epps' turn to go smug. 

                          EPPS 
                You expect this? 

     Wes' got nothing to say.  To Jaeger:

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Get the gold! 

     Jaeger grabs up the pack. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                     (To Wes) 
                Now let's try things another way.  Let's
                try this:  You and me and Jaeger are
                going to walk out of here.  We're going
                to walk out all smiling and friendly so 
                your little Shi'ite buddies won't suspect
                a thing.  Then we're going to hop on some
                horses, and ride away, and live happily 
                ever after.  It's all going to happen
                just like that, because if it doesn't 
                then I'm going to gut you like a fat pig.
                You understand me...soldier? 

     Wes says nothing.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                I'll take that as a yes. 

     Epps gruffly spins Wes around and presses the knife up
     against his back so that it is hidden. 

     EPPS MARCHES WES OUTSIDE THE TENT, stopping momentarily to
     grab up his pack with his free hand.  To Jaeger he says: 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Get the water.

     Jaeger does as he's told. 

                          WES 
                They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten
                feet before they cut you down. 

                          EPPS 
                You don't know John Epps very well, do
                you?

                          JAEGER 
                Can you ride a horse? 

                          EPPS 
                No, but I figure now's a real good time
                to start. 

     They walk on through the camp towards some saddled horses.
     They pass a Shi'ite who says something to Wes in Arabic.
     Epps gives Wes a poke in the back with the knife. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Don't say anything. 

     The Shi'ite, obviously expecting an answer, says whatever it
     was he said again. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Just keep quiet. 

                          WES 
                I have to answer him.

                          EPPS
                So you can give us away? 

                          WES 
                If I don't answer, he'll know something's
                up.

     Epps gives this a lot of thought in a very short time.

                          EPPS 
                You answer him, but you answer him wrong
                and you're going to be staring at your
                insides while you're dying. 

     Wes very calmly says something to the Shi'ite.  The Shi'ite 
     just stands there for a beat looking at the three men, then
     suddenly explodes in screams.  No way of knowing for sure
     what he's saying, but since he's going off like a Westec
     alarm it's a pretty good bet he's been tipped of.

     Epps rears back a fist and slams it into Wes' face.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Bastard! 

     Epps and Jaeger take off running for the horses, practically
     leaping into the saddles as Shi'ites come pouring out of 
     their tents.  Forgetting himself, Wes screams in English. 

                          WES
                Stop them! 

     Jaeger and Epps spur their horses and take off riding hard.
     It's amazing what you can do when a bunch of angry Shi'ites
     are chasing you.

     Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shi'ite and mounts
     up with blood in his eyes.  He leads a charge of armed, 
     mounted Shi'ites that looks like a posse going after some bad
     men. 

     Out front Epps and Jaeger pull up for a second.

                          JAEGER
                They coming? 

     Epps takes a look behind him.  He can't hardly miss the
     sandstorm Wes and the Shi'ites kick up as they ride for them. 

                          EPPS 
                Oh, yeah.  They're coming. 

     Epps points off to some foothills in the distance.  It's the
     only thing close to cover for miles around.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                Ride for the hills.  We'll try to lose 
                them.

     They take the reigns to their horses and get to riding.

     Behind them Wes yells to his riders, and signals for them to
     split up, and try to cut off Epps and Jaeger.

     Epps and Jaeger hit the hills.  They ride up for a bit, then
     stop to spot Wes.  Wes and his crew are better riders and 
     have closed the gap.  All the two can do now is try to lose
     them in the terrain.

     Epps and Jaeger ride as best they can, and somewhat 
     erratically to cover their trail.  They head up a ways, then
     cut across in a parallel direction.  Jaeger looks back, but
     sees no sign of Wes. 

                          JAEGER
                We lost them! 

     Just as the words leave Jaeger's mouth a hail of bullets 
     explodes the ground before them.  Their horses rear up, and
     it's all they can do to fight them.  Just ahead are the
     Shi'ites who split off from Wes, having circled around Epps
     and Jaeger. 

     The two yank their horses back, and ride hard in the opposite
     direction with the Shi'ites just behind.  They fire on Epps
     and Jaeger, the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them. 

     Epps and Jaeger are little more than passengers on their
     horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs.  And good
     for it, too, otherwise they might be dead by now.  They break
     for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it
     does little to shake loose their pursuers. 

     As Epps and Jaeger level out they can see the trail below
     them, and Wes and his posse riding for them.  Our two start
     back the way they came. but the other Shi'ites crest the
     hill.

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Which way? 

     Epps looks from side to side.  Either way is certain death.
     Then he looks off towards an embankment.  It is VERY steep.
     VERY treacherous. 

     It would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment 
     safely.  All Epps knows is there aren't any gun totting
     Shi'ites in that direction. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Which way do we go!? 

                          EPPS
                We go this way. 

     Fear gives way to desperation.  Both men whip their steeds
     hard.  The beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild
     ride down.  Both Epps and Jaeger have to lean back in their
     saddles until they're almost parallel to the ground just to
     stay on their horses. 

     Wes sees this and swears.  He signals to his men to cut back
     the other way. 

     Epps reaches the bottom of the embankment.  Jaeger is almost
     there when he looses control of his horse.  Both rider and
     animal go tumbling in an ugly fall. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Jaeger!

     The horse gets up and bolts off before Jaeger can get to her. 

     Just then Wes and his men make it back down the trail, and
     start riding hard for Jaeger.

     Epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen
     comrade.  As he rides in he leans to the side and low.
     Stretching out an arm Epps literally scoops Jaeger, and
     swings him up behind him.  A couple of rodeo performers
     couldn't have done it better. 

     Problem is with the extra weight they can't go very fast.
     Wes and his men close hard now.  The bullets fly fast and
     furious swarming all around our boys.

     Epps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to
      give.  This is it:  They get away now, or not at all.  Their
     horse finds a little something extra.  She goes faster,
     faster...

     Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.  The horse rears
     up, she goes wild.  It takes everything Epps has to control
     her.  But better that than if she'd taken another stride.
     They've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff.  Epps
     may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get
     this beast to fly. 

     Finally he calms the horse down, but it doesn't matter.  Wes
     and the Shi'ites ride up behind them cutting them off.  Wes
     stands down from his horse.

     Epps and Jaeger, with nowhere to go, do the same. 

                          WES
                The gold; give it to me.

     Epps takes the pack from Jaeger, but doesn't throw it to Wes.

                          WES(CONT)
                Give it to me! 

                          EPPS 
                If I give it to you, will you let us go? 

     Wes smiles and lies so badly he doesn't even bother trying to
     fake it. 

                          WES 
                Sure.  Whatever you want.  For old time
                sake.

     Epps has got no choice, really.  He tosses the pack to Wes' 
     feet who stoops to pick it up.  Wes starts to open the pack.

                          WES(CONT)
                Looks like at the end of the day we 
                finally find out who's better than who, 
                don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected
                more from you. 

                          EPPS
                It's like I said; you don't really know
                lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? 

     Wes rips open the pack.  He's got about one second to see
     what's inside.  NO GOLD.  JUST A BOOBY TRAPPED CLAYMORE MINE.

     Epps grabs Jaeger and yanks to him to the ground. 

     There is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily
     destroys Wes and a few of the Shi'ite standing next to him.
     The rest, along with the horses, scatter for dear life.

     Epps stays down until the coast is clear, then gets up.
     Jaeger, to say the least, is stunned. 

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Damn it.  We lost the horses.

                          JAEGER
                The...the gold... 

                          EPPS 
                It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore
                mine.  The gold's in my pack.

                          JAEGER
                When did you make the switch?

                          EPPS 
                It's always been like that.  When you 
                left me down in the crevice to send the
                gold up I figured I'd better...take 
                precautions.  I rigged it to blow if 
                anyone opened the pack.  Just in case 
                somebody thought they could do better on
                their own. 

                          JAEGER
                But...

                          EPPS 
                We had a deal.  No one touches the gold
                until we're out of here.  No one breaks
                the deal, no one had anything to worry
                about.

                          JAEGER 
                What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I
                mean, accidently, what if I had... 

                          EPPS
                You shouldn't think about things like
                that.  It'll just make you crazy. 

     We hold on the two men, on the smoking remains of Wes.  We
     hold on them, then:

     EXT. DESERT/ROAD - LATER 

     Epps and Jaeger come up to the road, a small highway.  It's 
     eerie; a road in the middle of the desert.  Quiet.  No cars.
     They just stand and stare at it for a beat.

                          JAEGER
                Well? 

                          EPPS 
                A car's got to come along sooner or
                later.  When it does, we jack it. 

                          JAEGER 
                How do we do that? 

                          EPPS 
                You lie in the middle of the road, look
                like you're hurt.  When the car stops I
                run over to the driver and put a gun to
                his head. 

                          JAEGER 
                Why do I have to lie in the road? 

                          EPPS 
                Somebody has to.

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, but why me?  What if the car
                doesn't stop? 

                          EPPS 
                Then I'm a rich man. 

     Epps sits by the side of the road waiting for a car.  The
     only thing he gets is more quiet.  Jaeger sits next to him.
     After a couple of beats: 

                          JAEGER
                Epps. 

                          EPPS
                Yeah. 

                          JAEGER 
                I want you to know... I don't know.  I
                just think you're a hell of a guy. 

                          EPPS
                Thanks. 

                          JAEGER 
                This whole time, you've kept your head.
                You didn't go money simple like me and 
                Wes.  You've just been trying to figure
                how to get us out of here.  And you've
                been fair too.  I mean, even after 
                I...you know... 

                          EPPS 
                Threatened to blow my brains out? 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take
                it out on me, except for maybe making me
                lie in the middle of the road now.  But
                I'd say you've been very fair.  I just 
                think it's a hell of a man who can keep
                from going money simple. 

                          EPPS 
                Don't make so much out of it.  Only
                reason I haven't figured a way to get all
                that money for myself is because I've
                been too busy figuring ways to stay 
                alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to
                catch my breath I might have played 
                things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no 
                better than anybody else.  I've just been
                busier. 

     They sit a while more.  Still no car.

                          JAEGER
                Epps? 

                          EPPS
                What? 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm thinking about taking a trip. 

                          EPPS 
                Thought you were going to buy a car. 

                          JAEGER
                Still am.  There's more gold than I 
                thought, and since there's only two of us
                now...  Where should I go? 

                          EPPS
                I don't know. 

                          JAEGER 
                I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't 
                know where to go.  Where would you go? 

                          EPPS 
                How the hell should I know? 

     Another long beat.  Still no car.

                          EPPS(CONT)
                Australia. 

                          JAEGER 
                What?

                          EPPS
                I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not 
                many people.  I think after this I'd like
                to quit people for awhile.  And the girls
                go crazy for brothers down there.

                          JAEGER
                Really? 

                          EPPS 
                That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls
                go crazy everywhere for a man with gold. 

     From the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor.  It
     draws closer and closer. 

     Epps and Jaeger stand.  Knowing they're so close to the end
     of a long adventure they become very business like.

                          JAEGER 
                Well, this is it.  We get the car, find 
                some Americans.  We find Americans we'll
                be all right. 

                          EPPS 
                We'll make up some kind of lie.  They
                won't find the gold. 

     Epps and Jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car
     draws closer. 

                          JAEGER
                Okay.  See you in a minute.

     Jaeger goes out and lays in the car's path.  Epps goes to
     hide behind some rocks.

     The car keeps getting closer and closer.

     Jaeger yells over to Epps. 

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Epps, I don't think he's slowing down. 

                          EPPS 
                He'll slow down.

     The car gets closer. 

                          JAEGER
                He's not slowing. 

                          EPPS 
                He's going to slow down. 

     The car gets closer. 

                          JAEGER
                Epps...Epps! 

     The car barrels right for Jaeger.  Forget what Epps says,
     it's not slowing down and Jaeger knows it.

                          JAEGER(CONT)
                Aw, damn!

     At the last possible second Jaeger rolls out of the way.  The
     car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where
     Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him.  The DRIVER loses 
     control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt.

     Epps runs to the car, rips open the driver's door, and
     presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head.

                          EPPS 
                You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK
                ENGLISH!? 

                          DRIVER
                     (Frightened) 
                Y-yes. 

     Jaeger runs over and jumps in the car.  Epps gets in behind
     the driver, keeping the gun pressed to his head.

                          EPPS 
                Where were you going? 

                          DRIVER
                Baghdad. 

                          EPPS 
                What's in the other direction? 

                          DRIVER
                This road, it leads straight to Kuwait. 

                          EPPS 
                Turn the car around.

                          DRIVER 
                Please, I beg of you.  The American army
                is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill
                me. 

                          EPPS 
                Nobody's going to hurt you.

     Epps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver.

                          EPPS(CONT) 
                You see that?  Gold.  You take us to the
                Americans, and we'll give you another
                one.  Now drive. 

     The driver turns around the car and starts back in the
     direction he came. 

     They drive on for awhile, mostly in silence.  Epps and Jaeger
     are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the
     driver is too scared.  Finally the driver starts to talk. 

                          DRIVER
                You are Americans, yes? 

     Neither Jaeger or Epps answer. 

                          DRIVER(CONT)
                We didn't not all want this war, do you
                know?  We didn't not all want to invade 
                our brothers and sisters in Kuwait.  Now
                your army crushes us.  So few days, and 
                so many have died.  And many fear we will
                all die.  Please tell this to your
                people:  We did not want this war.

     Still Jaeger and Epps say nothing.  Outside the car the 
     traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets
     thicker and thicker.

                          DRIVER(CONT)
                I have a brother in our army.  When I 
                take you back, will you look for him?  If
                he is still alive, will you look for him
                and take care of him? 

     This last bit gets to Epps.

                          EPPS 
                Yeah.  We'll look for him.

     Outside the traffic away from Kuwait has gotten so thick 
     everything is at a stand still.  There are Iraqi military
     vehicles pulling out, as well as a good many civilian cars
     and trucks.  It clogs up both lanes, and envelopes the car.
     Some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much
     faster.

                          JAEGER
                Look at this.

                          DRIVER 
                Iraqis.  They are fleeing from Kuwait,
                from your military.

                          EPPS 
                See if you can't drive around this.

     The driver tries to work the car free of the congestion, but
     he's wedged in, and not going anywhere.

     From out of the sky swoop down a flight of AMERICAN F-15E
     FIGHTER JETS.  They swing down on the far end of the highway,
     engines roaring like angry lions.  For a second time stands
     still.  Everyone on the road stops and looks up at the jets.

     Time starts again, and with a deadly vengeance.

     The fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway:  Vehicles and
     people, civilian and military alike.  There is no
     distinction, only carnage.

     This is the infamous Al Jahra highway from Basrah to Kuwait
     City that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on
     the last day of the war by American forces.  It became known
     as the Highway of Death. 

     The huge shells rip a bloody path, shredding cars and trucks,
     igniting explosions, straight towards the car with Epps,
     Jaeger and the driver.  With barely seconds to go before they
     are shot to pieces as well.  They dive from the car, Epps
     dragging the driver out, and scramble for cover along the
     side of the road. 

     The planes turn back for another pass.

                          JAEGER 
                What the hell are they doing?  There're 
                civilians in there.

     Not even thinking about what he's doing Jaeger jumps up and
     screams at the jets.

                          JAEGER(CONT) 
                DON'T SHOOT!  DON'T SHOOT!  THEY'RE
                CIVILIANS! 

     Epps jumps up and drags Jaeger back down to cover as the
     shells fram the jets cut dangerously close to them. 

     The jets bank and swoop for another run.

     Epps realizes there is something wrong.  He looks around
     desperately, but doesn't see...THERE, BACK IN THE CAR! 

                          EPPS
                The gold! 

     Epps runs for the car, trying to beat the jets.

                          JAEGER
                No!

     Jaeger lunges for Epps but misses him.  Epps snakes his way
     through the burning hulks towards their car.  He dodges,
     jukes and weaves among shells, shrapnel and explosions that 
     go off all around him.  He just makes it to the car, grabbing
     up the gold, as the fighters once again swing low and cut
     loose. 

     A wicked hail of shells reigns down.  It sets off a series of
     violent explosions that knocks Jaeger off his feet.  It takes
     him a beat to recover.  By then the fighters have done their
     job, and fly off. 

     Jaeger stands.  He walks towards the road over the plaintive
     wails of the barely living.  The car, the gold, Epps... they
     are essentially disintegrated.

     AS THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP WE SEE THAT IT ISN'T JUST
     THEIR CAR AND EPPS THAT ARE GONE.  There isn't much of 
     anything left on this road.  Just death, destruction and
     bloodshed.

     Jaeger is cleaned up, in dress uniform, and sitting at a 
     table before a MILITARY TRIBUNAL.  He looks very sullen, as
     if this whole adventure has robbed him of his soul. 

     The members of the tribunal just look pissed. 

                          CHIEF JUSTICE 
                The members of this tribunal have reached
                a verdict.  Based on the evidence 
                presented we find the defended guilty as
                charged of desertion, insurrection, 
                insubordination, and conduct unbecoming.
                Further the tribunal will recommend that
                the defendant be sentenced to life 
                imprisonment, and that from this day 
                forward he shall no longer walk as a free
                man.  You should consider yourself quite
                fortunate, son.  There was a time when 
                lesser crimes would have found you before
                a firing squad.  I don't know that a 
                person like you has much to say for
                himself, but it is your right say
                something. 

     Jager doesn't stand.  He doesn't look at the tribunal.  He
     just begins to talk. 

                          JAEGER 
                I'm sorry, I guess.  Not for looking for
                the gold, or leaving my post.  You know
                what it's like to have gold raining out 
                of your hands?  That'll give me enough to
                think about the rest of my days in the 
                brig.  I'm just sorry about Wes.  He was
                all right.  It was the gold that made him
                what he became.  If I hadn't found that
                map, if I hadn't talked them into going 
                searching...Wes just might have made it
                home after all.  I guess I feel
                responsible for him. 

                          CHIEF JUSTICE
                The way I view things you're responsible
                for the lives of two men:  Private First 
                Class Wes Hanmond, and Second Lieutenant 
                John Epps. 

                          JAEGER 
                Yeah, well, I've been thinking about 
                that.  See, there was an explosion and 
                everything, but I never really aaw Epps 
                get killed.  And nobody ever found the
                gold.  I guess they both could have been 
                burned to slag.  I guess.  But there were
                a lot of bodies out on that road.  A
                smart man could have found some 
                identification to use.  A smart man could
                have made his way up to Syria or Turkey.
                A smart man could have gotten himself
                right out of the Middle East.  A smart
                man with enough gold.  Way I figure, 
                right about now old Epps is sitting in a
                bar in Sydney, or Melboure, or maybe 
                Brisbane telling stories to one of the
                prettiest Aussies you ever saw. 

     The members of the tribunal just scoff.

                          CHIEF JUSTICE 
                I find it highly unlikely that anyone
                could accomplish such a thing.

                          JAEGER 
                Well, Sir, I guess you don't know Second 
                Lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? 

     Jaeger allows himself a slight smile as he leaves the
     tribunal with this question. 

                                                           FADE TO:

                       THE THREE MUSKETEERS

    OPEN ON:
1   EXT. GASCONY - DAWN                                        1

    Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-
    tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox
    darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out
    of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.

    SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625.
    Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points
    cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The
    first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every
    facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance
    and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this
    moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous
    cry.

    They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.
    Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is
    nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the
    air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-
    saults. This is fun.
    Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden
    fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they
    fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of
    hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.
    Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.
    D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard
    up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly
    cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,
    fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...
    and follows.


2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2

    Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard
    and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause
    to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other
    side, attacking, defending, as they go.

3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3

    Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances
    up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.
    She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open
    window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.

                                                        2.

4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4
    Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-
    closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies
    after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild
    progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --
    stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his
    sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan
    parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over
    the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and
    rises to fight again.
    The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-
    volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly
    endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the
    last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-
    moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs
    toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan
    with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes
    when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap
    to join him.
    And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of
    music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-
    ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just
    then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard
    backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he
    stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He
    prepares one last blow --
    -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the
    side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical
    antidote to all this glorious swordplay.


5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5
    Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of
    reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with
    grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation
    will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and
    lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's
    apple.

    A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,
    long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.

                            D'ARTAGNAN
              Had enough?
                            GIRARD
                     (breathless
                      deadpan)
              I believe now would be a good
              time to end your, uhm, formal
              training. Well done.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                             3.

5   CONTINUED:                                                    5
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Thank you, sir.

    D'Artagnan leaps to his feet, races off without another
    word. Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his
    clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked.

                               GIRARD
                 And god have mercy on whomever
                 you meet next.

                                                   CUT TO:

6   EXT. GASCONY - HANDSOME WOMAN'S POV - DAY                     6

    D'Artagnan races across the green fields, triumphant.

    She stands at the open window, watches his coltish high
    steps with love. Sadness too.

8   INT. D'ARTAGNAN'S HOME - DAY                                  8

    D'Artagnan steps through the country manor, calls out:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                 Mother...?

    But he does not see her.    D'Artagnan continues, chatter-
    ing proudly as he goes.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Did you see us? You heard us,
                 I'll bet. Girard finally
                 surrendered a compliment...
                 though I almost had to kill him
                 to get it... Mother...?
    D'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond.
    He pauses, then steps inside.

9   INCLUDE FATHER'S STUDY                                        9

    A Spartan interior. Heraldic emblems upon the wall, sou-
    venirs from battles won and lost.

    A piece of parchment, on it the words: "All For One, and
    One For All." And, in a place of honor, a worn blue and
    gold tunic. Below it, the Handsome Woman, d'Artagnan's
    mother, kneels at an open chest. She turns back to him.
                              MOTHER (HANDSOME WOMAN)
                 Sit down.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Didn't you hear me? Girard --

                              MOTHER
                 Sit.
    D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair. A beat.
    His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open
    chest.
                               MOTHER
                 Your father was a proud man. And
                 he had a right to be. I never
                 knew one as brave or as kind. He
                 knew that his strength was a gift
                 to be given in the service of
                 honor. That is why he dedicated
                 his life to his country and his
                 King. That is why he gave his
                 life, for both.

    She reaches into the chest, carefully extracts a
    beautiful saber.
                               MOTHER
                 I watched you this morning and
                 saw someone I knew. You have
                 your father's heart, his will to
                 fight, his courage. But these
                 gifts have no value unless they
                 are given.
    She rises, holds the sword out to him.

                               MOTHER
                 It's time for you find your
                 fortune with men as brave and
                 as bold as you are. In Paris.
                 With the King's Musketeers.
                        (re: sword)
                 You'll need this.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                        (quiet, moved)
                 Father's sword.

                                MOTHER
                  Forged in the Crusades, handed
                  from generation to generation.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  And now to me.

     D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the
     nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno-
     cence. His mother smiles as she repeats.

                                 MOTHER
                  Yes, son.   And now to you.
     With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.         D'Artagnan
     takes it firmly into his hands.

     A huge and beautiful field appropriate to the moment.
     Mother and son stand in the vast expanse. D'Artagnan
     holds a restless horse by the reins, his traveling satch-
     el attached to the saddle.
                                MOTHER
                  I'm not your mother now. I'm
                  speaking for your father. And
                  this is what he would have told
                  you. Never forget the code of
                  the d'Artagnans. It is your
                  special heritage.

                  I will.

                  Never run from a fight...
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I won't.

                                MOTHER
                  Never submit to insults.    Except
                  from the King.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Never.

                  And be wary of Cardinal Richelieu
                  for he rules France through the
                  King.
     A bittersweet moment. D'Artagnan posed before his first
     great adventure. But not completely certain that he
     wishes to leave home.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Mother. Maybe I should wait.
                  Until after harvest.
     D'Artganan's mother smiles, understands.       And speaks
     gently to urge him forward.

                                MOTHER
                  You've heard that every man in
                  the Musketeers is on the run from
                  someone or something?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.   But what am I running from?

                                MOGHER
                         (gentle humor)
                  A shrew of a mother, and a drafty
                  old house. Now go.

     And in this fashion, she releases him. D'Artagnan sweeps
     his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps
     into the saddle. The horse reacts with a start, skitters
     in a half-cicle. D'Artagnan struggles to gain control,
     finally brings the horse to rein. He manages a charmed
     grin. His mother smiles, scolds:
                                MOTHER
                  And for heaven's sake, practice
                  your horsemanship.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  Horsemanship.    Got it.
     D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots
     off across bright green fields. His Mother shields her
     eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and
     watches him ride into the distance.

12   EMBLEM OF KING'S MUSKETEERS                                  12
     It FILLS the SCREEN, serves as background for the MAIN
     TITLES. As the FINAL CREDIT APPEARS, and the MUSIC ENDS,
     the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME. It slides beneath the
     emblem, pries it off the wall. The emblem falls to the
     floor with an undignified thud. A fire blazes in a huge
     hearth behind it.


13   INCLUDE MUSKETEERS' HEADQUARTERS                             13
     A room in the Musketeers Headquarters. The fallen emblem
     is retrieved by JUSSAC, an officer who wears the bright
     red tunic of the Cardinal's Guards.
                             JUSSAC
               What should I do with this?

     Jussac offers   the emblem to a tall, elegant wraith in
     black finery,   a patch covers one eye. This is the COUNT
     DE ROCHEFORT,   Richelieu's right hand, one of the deadli-
     est swordsmen   in all of France.
                             ROCHEFORT
               Throw it on the fire with
               everything else.
                             JUSSAC
               But this is the emblem of the
               Musketeers...
                             ROCHEFORT
               The Musketeers no longer exist.
               Or haven't you heard?
                      (cold command)
               Throw it on the fire.
     Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze, it is
     instantly consumed. Rochefort watches it burn, then
     walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard.

14   INCLUDE COURTYARD                                            14
     Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove
     their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that
     already contains their swords and muskets. The
     Musketeers remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal
     the depth of their despair. The latter is supervised by
     the Cardinal's Guards, who view their hated enemies'
     plight with satisfaction. This is a sad day for the
     Musketeers, the end of an era.

     MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE forces a salute toward the captain
     of the Cardinal's Guards, hands over his own musket.

     Treville is the respected leader of the Musketeers.       This
     is the saddest moment of all.

     Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his
     lips. He steps to the railing, addresses the men below.

                                  ROCHEFORT
                  Musketeers...
     A hundred faces turn   upward to regard him. And on each
     the same expression   -- absolute loathing for the man in
     black. Rochefort is    not intimidated by this sea of con-
     tempt. He revels in    it.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  By joint edict of His Majesty
                  King Louis XIII and His Eminence
                  Cardinal Richelieu, the
                  Musketeers are officially
                  disbanded. In preparation for
                  the coming war with England, your
                  ranks and commissions are hereby
                  transferred to the Infantry. You
                  will be contacted and told where
                  to report. Until that time, you
                  are instructed to return to your
                  homes.
                                DE TREVILLE
                         (shouting to
                          Rochefort)
                  And who will protect the King?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  The Cardinal's Guards are more
                  than capable of assuming that...
                  responsibility.

     Muttered curses and dissent throughout.       Rochefort raises
     his voice to be heard:

                                ROCHEFORT
                  You are hereby ordered to
                  disperse. Should even one of you
                  resist... the entire corps will
                  be arrested and imprisoned.
                         (with pleasure
                          and disdain)
                  'All for one, and one for all.'

     As Rochefort intended, the Musketeers explode. But
     before they can attack the Guards, de Treville's com-
     manding voice calls out above the clamor.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Musketeers!

     And with that, the Musketeers freeze. Their eyes go to
     de Treville. There is a moment of silence as de Treville
     chooses his words carefully. Even in defeat, de Treville
     is stoic.

                                DE TREVILLE
                  Go to your homes. Wait. Our
                  day will come again.

     De Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles
     in a patronizing manner. Then, de Treville leads his
     Musketeers out of the courtyard.


15   ROCHEFORT                                                  15
     He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by.
     Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes to a
     mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak-
     ish angle. That's when he catches a glimpse of something
     behind him. Something red. Rochefort turns.
     a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the
     room, a spectre in red.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Your Eminence.
     Rochefort and Jussac instantly fall to their knees.
     ARMAND DU PLEISS THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU steps out of the
     darkness and into the light, his long crimson robes
     swirling about him like clouds of blood. His face is
     long, shrewd and intelligent. His eyes are penetrat-
     ing. He smiles his crocodile smile.
     Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls.
     It contains the names of all the Musketeers, past and
     present.
                                RICHELIEU
                  Have they all been accounted for?

                         (hedging)
                  All but... three.

     On Richelieu's face, a flicker of irritation.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Three?

16   EXT. BOULEVARD OF CRIME - DAY                                   16
     Jussac leads   a regiment of the Cardinal's Gruards down
     Paris' most   colorful and notorious street. They react
     to SHOUTING   and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern
     ahead. The    one called... The Dead Rat.
     The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's
     Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody.
     Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open,
     and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his
     feet, threatening to drop him into the street. The
     Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women,
     song -- is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts:
                                JUSSAC
                  Release that man!!
     Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges
     to the street with a dull thud. Then, with a wink and a
     piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside. Jussac darkens,
     signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.


17   INT. TAVERN                                                     17

     Jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in
     a shambles, the aftermath of a violent fight. But for
     now, all is calm.

     A group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big
     table littered with flagons and bottles. On the floor
     around them are their swords and rifles. It appears the
     Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's
     something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection,
     we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under-
     clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are
     all bruised and bloody. Some are unconscious.

     Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers.
     They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their
     boots up.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand-
     kerchief. He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of
     the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of
     great personal charm and style.
     His companion is   ATHOS, the Musketeers' deadliest and
     most charismatic   member -- also its most mysterious and
     tortured. Athos    is the unofficial leader of the Three
     Musketeers, their   planner and strategist. At the moment,
     he's sewing up a   nasty gash on his right arm.

                                JUSSAC
                         (approaching)
                  What is this?

     Athos greets him with a dark smile.

                                ATHOS
                  A private party. Go away.
                                ARAMIS
                  Athos -- is that any way to greet
                  our guests?

     Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously.    He is the
     epitome of politeness.
                                ARAMIS
                  Don't be shy, gentlemen. Come
                  in. Your friends have been
                  expecting you.
     Jussac is not amused.

                                JUSSAC
                  Your presence is requested at
                  Musketeer Headquarters by Captain
                  Rochefort.
     Athos and Aramis exchange looks.

                                ATHOS
                  The Cyclops is a Captain? He
                  must've made a pact with the
                  Devil.

                                ARAMIS
                  Or the Cardinal.
                                ATHOS
                  What's the difference?

                         (with an edge
                          of contempt)
                  The Devil is more ethical than
                  the Cardinal.

     Jussac takes a step forward, fingering his saber.

                                JUSSAC
                  You're instructed to come with
                  me and surrender your tunics.

     With a sweeping gesture, Athos indicates the bloody
     Guards around him.

                                ATHOS
                  These gentlemen made a similar
                  request.
                                JUSSAC
                  Are you refusing to come
                  peaceably?
                                ATHOS
                  Probably. But I'll leave it up
                  to my companions. Aramis?
                                ARAMIS
                  We can't refuse Rochefort's
                  invitation. It would be
                  impolite.
     Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward.

                                ATHOS
                  And what do you say, Porthos?

     To the Guards' surprise, Porthos is balancing on the
     balcony rail above, just about even with a large wagon
     wheel chandelier.

                                PORTHOS
                  I'll be right down!
     With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the
     balcony and lands atop the chandelier. His weight causes
     the chains suspending it to break. With a whoop of
     pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands
     squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.

     When the dust clears, only Jussac has been spared. He
     looks on in disbelief as Porthos extricates himself from
     the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off.

     Athos and Aramis sheathe their swords, put on their hats,
     wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join
     Porthos.
                                ARAMIS
                  Congratulations, Porthos.   You

                  My aim was off. I was trying to

     Athos fixes Jussac with a dark, threatening look.

                  Now.   About those tunics...
     Jussac turns to watch Athos, Porthos, and Aramis step to

18   EXT. HIGH ROAD TO PARIS - DAY                                  18
     D'Artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook-
     ing the magnificent city on the Seine. What he beholds
     is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven-
     teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the
     sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a
     magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.
     D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING
     HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and
     what he sees is this:
     Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth
     pursued by two men on horseback.

19   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     19

     His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women
     GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly
     formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby
     tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.

                                                           14.

20   ANGLE                                                       20
     As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into
     space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the
     saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense-
     less. One down.
     D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re-
     verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan.
     The rider draws his saber.
     D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches
     the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the
     saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at
     d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is
     upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the
     second rider is senseless. Two down.

     D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath,
     but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as
     the two women ride back to see what's happened.
     The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark-
     haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her
     companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and
     equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE.
     Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan.
     She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off.
     Constance remains. She smiles down at d'Artagnan from
     atop her horse.
                             CONSTANCE
               Do you have any idea what you've
               done?

                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I've saved you and your friend
               from these bandits.

                             CONSTANCE
               These 'bandits' are the Queen's
               own bodyguards.

     D'Artagnan is stunned.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
               The Queen?

     Constance points a finger in Anne's direction.
                             CONSTANCE
               If I were you, I'd make myself
               scarce. These men are going to be
               very angry when they wake up.

     D'Artagnan looks at the two bodyguards who are beginning
     to recover. Then he looks up at Constance, feeling like
     a prize idiot.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I didn't know. I thought...

     Constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling.
                                CONSTANCE
                  Do you have a name?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                CONSTANCE
                  You're a very foolish boy,
                  d'Artagnan... but a very handsome
                  one. Good-bye.
     Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with
     Anne.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (calling after her)
                  Wait!   You didn't tell me your
                  name!
     But Constance is gone.
     D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling
     foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two
     bodyguards groan and grumble.

     A bright reflection catches d'Artagnan's eye. He looks
     down and sees a gleaming bracelet. He picks it up and...

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The man who attacked you...
                         (pointing in the
                          opposite direction)
                  ... went that way.
     With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides
     like Hell.

     D'Artagnan rides to the top of the ridge, stops suddenly,
     sees something that takes his breath away.

22   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV                                             22
     Paris laid out for him like a jewel, cloaked in mystery,
     promising adventure and romance. D'Artagnan watches the
     women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance.
     He follows.

23   INT. MUSKETEER HEADQUARTERS - DAY                            23
     Athos, Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted
     courtyard. Silence -- the last thing they expected --
     stops them in their tracks. The place is a cemetery,
     haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers.
     Porthos is visibly distraught. Rochefort enters from
     behind an archway.

                             ROCHEFORT
               I'll take those tunics,
               Musketeers.
                             PORTHOS
                      (to Aramis)
               What did he say?
                             ARAMIS
               He said he'll take those tunics.
                              PORTHOS
               Tunics?   Coming right up.
     Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled
     red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He
     drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out
     another. He finds another in his boot and another up his
     sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he
     keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places.

     Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves.
     They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile.

                             ATHOS
               I was trying to remember the last
               time I saw you here. I know. It
               was the day you were kicked out of
               the Musketeers.

                             ARAMIS
               Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer.
               Wasn't that the charge?

                             ROCHEFORT
               You ought to know. Three witnesses
               stood against me.

                                ATHOS
                  It was the least we could do.

     The bitter memory hangs in the air for a moment.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You are hereby ordered to
                  surrender your commissions and
                  make yourselves available for
                  reassignment in the King's Army.

                                ATHOS
                  And if we refuse?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You will become outlaws.   Hunted
                  men.
                                PORTHOS
                  It doesn't matter where I go or
                  what I do. Sooner or later
                  somebody's calling me 'outlaw.'
     Athos cuts him off with a look. He's familiar with
     Porthos' propensity for tall tales. But not here, not
     now. Athos turns back to the balcony. Rochefort lobs a
     taunt.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Are you refusing to serve your
                  King?
                                ARAMIS
                  We are refusing to serve the
                  Cardinal.
                                PORTHOS
                  Same thing, these days.
                                ARAMIS
                  France has one King too many.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll tell him you said that.

     Athos, who has remained silent, speaks with quiet power:

                                ATHOS
                  Do that, Rochefort. Tell his
                  Emminence the Cardinal that we
                  will continue to perform our sworn
                  duty to protect the King. From
                  enemies across the sea.

                  Musketeers.

     The gauntlet has been thrown.       Rochefort picks it up with
     glee.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll make sure His Emminence the
                  Cardinal gets the message. But I
                  can't promise he'll be pleased.

     Rochefort steps back, disappears into the shadows.       A
     beat. The Musketeers regard each other.

24   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - DAY                                  24

     D'Artagnan rides through the streets of Paris. A country
     boy happily stunned by the sights, sounds, and smells of
     the city. Merchants gossip and call to each other from
     shop doors. Colorful vendors and pedestrians move along
     the crowded boulevard. Acrobats, puppeteers, and jug-
     glers perform on street corners. LAUGHTER and MUSIC
     drift from taverns and public houses.

     D'Artagnan views it all with great enthusiasm. He sees
     the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters... wow! The
     future belongs to him.

25   ATHOS                                                        25
     He crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door. But as
     he reaches for the handle, the door flies open and smacks
     him in his injured arm.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (as he enters)

                         (wincing in pain)
                  Aaarrgghh...

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (in a panic; looking
                          around)
                  Where are they? Where are the
                  Musketeers? I'm in the right
                  place, aren't I?

                                ATHOS
                         (through gritted
                          teeth)
                  Not as far as I'm concerned.

     Athos is wearing his cape in such a way that it hides
     his Musketeer tunic. D'Artagnan has no idea who he's
     dealing with.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But this is Musketeer

                  No. This was Musketeer

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You mean it's been moved?

                                ATHOS
                  I mean the Musketeers have been
                  disbanded. Feel free to poke
                  around for souvenirs.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What do you mean 'disbanded'?

                                ATHOS
                  Some nonsense about being needed in
                  the army. Now if you'll excuse
                  me...
     D'Artagnan blocks Athos' path.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But I just got here. How can I
                  become a Musketeer if they've been
                  disbanded?
                                ATHOS
                  I'd say you've got a problem.
     D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm. Athos, stif-
     ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look.
                                ATHOS
                  You could use a lesson in manners.
     D'Artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the pos-
     sibility of a duel.
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Any time.

                                ATHOS
                  I'm in a hurry now -- but I'll
                  meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux
                  monastery at noon.

     Athos exits.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (calling after him)
                  I'll be there ten minutes early.

                  An hour in Paris, and I already
                  have my first duel!
     Just then, d'Artangnan spies two familiar figures on
     horseback, distinctive cloaks hiding their faces. Anne
     and Constance, though he does not yet know their names.
     D'Artagnan hurries after.

26   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - DAY                                  26

     START CLOSE ON Porthos, his rogue's grin, the twinkle in
     his eye.
                                PORTHOS
                  But, Catherine, don't you see? As
                  an outlaw I'll be constantly on
                  the run from the Cardinal's guards,
                  a refugee. Think of all the places
                  you can hide me. I'm thinking of
                  them now.

27   ANOTHER ANGLE                                          27

     reveals Porthos leaning against an open window, speaking
     amiably to a pretty woman on the other side. She dabs a
     tear from her eye, manages a nod.


28   ANGLE ON D'ARTAGNAN                                    28
     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan races around another corner, down a
     narrow lane, and speeds after the ladies on horseback.
     He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water
     all over Porthos where he stands. D'Artagnan doesn't
     notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled
     INTO VIEW, blocking the lane. Fellow travelers shout
     complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an
     obscene gesture. It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam.

     D'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis-
     tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. A man
     waits in the shadows to escort them. D'Artagnan leaps
     off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot.
     But he takes two quick steps, and... runs directly into
     Porthos' outstretched hand.

     D'Artagnan looks up -- literally, given Porthos' impres-
     sive stature -- and sees the Musketeer's muddied tunic,
     and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly
     soiled.
                                PORTHOS
                         (not a glimmer of a
                          grin)
                  Do you know where this sash comes
                  from?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  No.
                                PORTHOS
                  It is a gift from the Queen of
                  America.
     Porthos' righteous indignation is more impressive than
     his knowledge of current affairs. D'Artagnan corrects.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  There is no Queen of America.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to pretty woman)
                  Madame Augustine, would you excuse
                  me for a moment, I'm going to kill
                  him.
                         (back to d'Artagnan;
                          ever the gentleman)
                  Now, where were we?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (glancing at the
                          ladies; the alley)
                  I rode through a puddle, muddied
                  your sash, the Queen of America
                  except there isn't one, I'm in a
                  hurry, and you were about to
                  challenge me to a duel.

                                  PORTHOS
                           (amused)
                  I was?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  That seems to be the local custom.
     Porthos lets out a weary sigh.         He shakes his head.

                  Everywhere I go, it's always the
                  same. There's always some kid who
                  thinks he's hot with a sword...
                  some itchy punk who wants to go
                  up against the great Porthos...

                         (when d'Artagnan
                          isn't impressed)
                  Me, you idiot.

     D'Artagnan gives him a blank look.
                                PORTHOS
                  Don't you know who I am?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The world's greatest talker?

     Porthos couldn't be more insulted.       He sputters with
     rage.
                                PORTHOS
                  All right, you little puke! You
                  want to die? So be it! One
                  o'clock behind the Luxembourg!
                  And bring a coffin!
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Bring your own!


29   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - ALLEY - DAY                               29
     D'Artagnan thinks he sees     Anne and Constance, races down
     the alley, turns a corner,     down a short street, makes a
     hasty decision, runs down     yet another alley... and tum-
     bles into a shadowy lane.      He stops, looks left and
     right. And does see them.

     The ladies enter a chapel's back door, close the door
     behind them. D'Artagnan flies after, skids across cob-
     blestones, rips the door open... and finds himself face
     to face with the man who has escorted Anne and Constance
     this far.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN

                  The young women do not wish to be

                  I'll deliver it for you.

                  No, you've been enough help
                  already. Would you be so kind
                  as to point out the Carmes-Deshaux
                  Monastery?
     The Guard points to a large building in the distance with
     a large cross.

     PAN ACROSS the Virgin Mary and many lit candles to a
     BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third
     Musketeer, the dashing Aramis. Aramis has a book open
     and is reading from it.
     The Damsel suddenly grabs Aramis and kisses him on the
     mouth. Aramis politely extricates himself. He's not the
     least bit embarrassed, only slightly amused.

                                ARAMIS
                  Madam, I'm flattered but I thought
                  you wanted me to tutor you in
                  theology.

                                DAMSEL
                  Excuse me, Monsieur Aramis. But
                  when you started talking about
                  Original Sin, I lost control and
                  became impassioned. It won't
                  happen again.

                                ARAMIS
                  There's nothing unholy about
                  expressing one's emotions. On
                  the contrary. Religion should be
                  experienced in a passionate, all-
                  embracing way. We should feel
                  free to express our spirituality.

                                  DAMSEL
                  Yes, darling!
     The Damsel attacks him again.         Suddenly, a pounding on
     the door.
                                  MAN (O.S.)
                  Open up!

                                DAMSEL
                         (a gasp of fear)
                  My husband!
                                ARAMIS
                  Your husband!?
                                DAMSEL
                  Aramis -- run!

     But Aramis' heart is too noble.         He gets down on his
     knees.

                                ARAMIS
                  First we must pray to God for
                  forgiveness.

     That's when the door bursts open and the lady's husband,
     an irate MARQUIS enters with a pistol. His eyes blaze
     with madness. He aims the pistol at Aramis' head.

                                ARAMIS
                  On second thought, God's often
                  busy.
     Aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window.

     As the Marquis aims and FIRES, Aramis puts one foot on
     the ledge and leaps into space. The shot misses him by
     inches.

                                                            26.

     As d'Artagnan runs past. Aramis lands on top of him and
     they go crashing to the cobblestones. As they untangle
     themselves and get up...
                             ARAMIS
               Thanks. You broke my fall
               perfectly. But I do apologize
               for the inconvenience...

                      (angry)
               Get off me!
     D'Artagnan pushes Aramis aside. Aramis grabs d'Artagnan
     by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back.

                             ARAMIS
               If there's one thing I can't
               abide, it's rudeness.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               You fell on me!
                             ARAMIS
               And I apologized for it.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I suppose you'd like to teach me a
               lesson in manners, too.
                             ARAMIS
               I'd be honored.
     D'Artagnan brightens.   Another duel!
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               How's two o'clock behind the
               Luxembourg?
     Aramis bows politely.

                             ARAMIS
               If that's where you wish to die,
               I won't disappoint you. Until
               then...

     Aramis takes off.   d'Artagnan swells with pride.

33   INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY                                       33

     Anne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room,
     a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy
     a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac-
     ular map of the world. The map contains every known
     country and continent, including the New World. The
     SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom.
     Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And
     for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely
     a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings
     and queens who came before her. And a long way from
     home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She
     reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a
     pang of separation. We hear:
                             MAN (O.S.)
               Your Majesty...

     Anne reacts with a start. A tall, powerfully built man
     stands in the shadows, a spectre in red.
                             ANNE
               Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised
               me.
     Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness.     He smiles.

                             RICHELIEU
               How was your ride?

     Richelieu's question takes her by surprise. He bows
     before Anne. Considering a reply, she extends her hand.
     The Cardinal kisses it.

                               ANNE
               My ride...?    Well, I... I'm not
               sure...
                             RICHELIEU
                      (rising up)
               Forgive me.

               But your welfare is
               more than a matter of personal
               interest. It is a matter of
               State. But rest assured, your
               secret is safe with me.

     His manner is both charming and paternal. Anne, smart
     enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings,
     is nonetheless touched by his concern.

                                 ANNE
                  Thank you.
     Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.

                                RICHELIEU
                  You're homesick.
                                ANNE
                         (after a beat)
                  Lonely. Is that the same thing?
                                 RICHELIEU
                  Sometimes.
     Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues:
                                RICHELIEU
                  Austria's loss is France's gain.
                                ANNE
                  I'm not sure my new husband shares
                  your opinion.
                                  RICHELIEU
                  Nonsense.    He's young, not blind.

                                ANNE
                  Mostly, he is absent. I've barely
                  seen His Majesty since our wedding,
                  and that was three months ago.
                  Whenever he's around me, he has
                  nothing to say.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Arranged marriages can be
                  difficult. Your father and I
                  thought yours would bring Austria
                  and France closer together.

                  Countries align more swiftly than
                  people, I'm afraid. Louis and I
                  remain... far apart.
                                RICHELIEU
                  May I advise you?

     He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.        Anne
     nods assent.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Louis was only nine years old
                  when his father was assassinated.
                  He lost his childhood forever that
                  day. I have watched him grow
                  toward manhood, seen the toll his
                  life demands. A boy who is not
                  allowed to be a boy sometimes has
                  difficulty becoming a man. He is
                  shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet
                  stubborn. But most of all, he is
                  not yet sure exactly who he is.
                  The boy who lost his father. Or
                  the King of France.
                                ANNE
                  But how can I...?

                                RICHELIEU
                  Flatter him. Make the boy feel
                  like a King. So that the King
                  may be your husband.

     Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply...
     when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull
     boom, the Seneschal chants:

                                SENESCHAL
                  His Majesty, the King.

     The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is
     surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face
     is handsome and intelligent.

                                  RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty.
                                LOUIS
                  Cardinal Richelieu, I've been
                  looking for you.

     As Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow.

     When Louis sees Anne, he reacts with an almost imper-
     ceptible start. Her presence catches him off guard.

                                LOUIS
                  Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know
                  you were here.

     Louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love,
     behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's
     confidences, replies:

                                ANNE
                  Would you like me to go?
     Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here.       Determin-
     ation breeds a more capable attitude.

                                LOUIS
                  No.  Please, stay.
                         (to Richelieu, aware
                          that she is watching
                          him)
                  Your Eminence, I demand an answer.

                                RICHELIEU
                         (hiding his amusement)
                  Perhaps if I knew the question...
                                LOUIS
                  I've just been told that you went
                  ahead and disbanded my Musketeers.
                                RICHELIEU
                  You approved the decision.
                                LOUIS
                  But not the timing of the matter.
                  I intended to address them myself,
                  explain the situation...
                                RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty, France is on the
                  brink of war. We dare not
                  hesitate.

                                LOUIS
                  But these men are my personal
                  guards...
                                RICHELIEU

                  field if we're to win this war
                  with England. Buckingham plans
                  to invade La Rochelle within the
                  month. I thought it best to act
                  quickly --

                  I will be the judge of what is
                  best. For me, and for France.

     He says it with newfound resolve. Richelieu receives the
     rebuke with quiet grace. Anne watches the latter closely,
     suppresses a smile. The boy is nearer to King than
     Richelieu imagined.

                                 RICHELIEU
                  Of course.   Forgive me.

     the door.

                  Get out of the way, idiot!!

     A speeding carriage bears down on him. D'Artagnan leaps
     from its path, stumbles. He looks up in time to see the
     passenger inside, and for a moment, time seems to stop.

     She is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty, her face framed
     by the carriage window. Long blonde curly hair that
     cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes,
     and skin as white as alabaster. She is known as MILADY
     DE WINTER. She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence.

     D'Artagnan watches as if in a dream. The carriage, the
     beautiful woman inside it. Paris wraps its arms around
     the young man's heart. Suddenly: a second face enters the
     carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. It
     is the fierce visage of Milady's Indo-Chinese Bodyguard,
     PARKER. The bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage
     window curtains, taking Milady, the dream, from view.
     HOLD ON d'Artagnan, bewitched, as the CARRIAGE RUMBLES off
     into the city.

36   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - SEINE - POV SHOT - DAY              36
     A beautiful house situated near the Seine. Milady's
     carriage stops before it. She steps to the street,
     Parker follows. After a brief spoken exchange, the body-
     guard departs on some errand. HENRI, the driver, a brutal-
     looking fellow, incongruous in his elegant coachman's
     uniform, snaps the reins, and guides the carriage away.
     Milady steps inside.


37   ANOTHER ANGLE - POV                                         37
     REVEALS this to have been the POV of two men standing in
     the shadows across the street. COUNT DE WINTER, forty-
     five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE
     WINTER, twenty-five, his son. They are well-dressed. But
     their manner and appearance suggests that they have
     traveled a long distance to find her.
                               COUNT DE WINTER
                  Wait here.
                                ARMAND
                  But, Father...

                               COUNT DE WINTER
                  Wait.
     He will not consider otherwise. Armand sighs, stands in
     the shadows, and watches his father cross toward Milady's
     house.

38   INT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   38
     Milady stands before a mirror, reaches for one of the many
     ivory combs that adorn her hair. As she places the comb
     we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm. She
     pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of
     Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark
     and cold. Milady does not move from the reflecting glass,
     she smiles.

                             MILADY
               Count de Winter.

                             COUNT DE WINTER
                      (as much happiness as
                       the thought allows)
               We found you.

                             MILADY
                      (eyes on the mirror)
               Yes. Now that you have, what
               will you do?
                             COUNT DE WINTER
               Bring you back. To pay for what
               you did to my son.
                             MILADY
               And if I resist...?
                             COUNT DE WINTER
                      (voice breaking with
                       emotion)
               I will kill you with my bare
               hands.

     The Count steps closer, close enough to touch. Milady,
     eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about
     her lips, replies:

                             MILADY
               Well if that's the case, I'd
               better start packing. But first,
               my hair...
     Milady, who has been removing combs throughout, reaches
     for the next, and...

     Armand keeps his eyes on Milady's house opposite. No
     sign of his father. He looks about, impatient... and
     steps across the street to enter.

                                                 CUT TO:

40   INT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    40
     Armand climbs a flight of stairs.    Still no sign of his
     father, or Milady. He calls out:

                            ARMAND
               Father?

     Worry makes him hurry. Armand takes hasty steps into
     Milady's bedroom. The first thing he sees is his own
     face in the mirror. The second is his father's inert
     body below it. Armand gasps, races to his side. A thin
     trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's
     ear. Armand gathers his father up into his arms, and
     begins to weep.
                                                  CUT TO:


41   EXT. CARMES-DESCHAUX MONASTERY - DAY                         41
     The monastery is a windowless building   bordered by a
     barren field, a dueling ground for men   who have little
     time to waste.  Athos sits on a stone   bench, waits for
     his adversary to arrive. His horse is    hobbled nearby.
     D'Artagnan rides INTO VIEW, dismounts.
                             ATHOS
               Ten minutes early.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I have another appointment at one.
                             ATHOS
               You'll miss it, I'm afraid.

                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I'll try my best to be on time.

     Athos appreciates the young man's retort, takes a closer
     look. Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm
     makes him wince.

                             ATHOS
               I asked two of my friends to act
               as seconds, but they are not as
               punctual.

     D'Artagnan notices Athos' pained expression, the blood on
     his sleeve.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               But you're wounded.

                             ATHOS
               Don't worry. I fight just as well
               with my left hand.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  If you'd rather kill me another
                  time...
                                ATHOS
                  Thanks, but I see my seconds
                  coming now.

     Porthos and Aramis arrive on horseback. They dismount,
     view d'Artagnan with amazement. D'Artagnan reacts with
     similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to Athos)
                  What're you doing? You can't
                  fight this man.

                                ATHOS
                  Why not?
                                PORTHOS
                  Because I'm fighting him.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Excuse me, monsieur. But not
                  until one o'clock.
                                ARAMIS
                         (amused)
                  Wait a minute. I've got a duel
                  with him, too.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes, sir.   But not until two.
                                ATHOS
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  How long have you been in Paris?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I arrived this morning.

                                ATHOS
                  You've been... busy.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I've also fallen in love.
                                ATHOS
                         (gruff to a fault)
                  Better to die for love than to
                  live for it. Gentlemen?

     Athos gestures for Aramis and Porthos to stand aside. He
     draws his saber, ready to fight. A beat. And in that
     moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never
     felt before in his young life. Fear. Athos sees it,
     allows him a moment to withdraw his saber. D'Artagnan
     does so, they square off, touch sabers, and...

     ... Jussac leads a patrol of the Cardinal's Guards INTO
     VIEW.
                                JUSSAC
                  There they are!!
     Athos and d'Artagnan separate as Jussac and his four
     swordsmen stride towards them.

                                 ARAMIS
                  Jussac.   Again.
     Athos steps forward to meet him.
                                ATHOS
                  I told you the next time we met
                  I'd want an answer. But I didn't
                  expect you so soon.
                                JUSSAC
                  The three of you are under arrest.
                  The boy's of no interest to me
                  and is free to go. Do you intend
                  to resist?
                                PORTHOS
                  Oh, don't be stupid. Of course we
                  intend to resist. Just give us
                  a second.

     Porthos huddles with Athos and Aramis.
                                PORTHOS
                  Interesting odds. Five of them
                  and three of us.
                                ARAMIS
                  It hardly seems fair. Let's give
                  them the chance to surrender.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (interrupting)
                  Excuse me, but there are four of
                  us.

     They turn and regard d'Artagnan.

                  This is not your fight.    You're
                  not a Musketeer.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I may not wear the uniform, but I
                  believe I have the heart of a
                  Musketeer.
     The three Musketters exchange smiles. D'Artagnan's
     youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism.

                                PORTHOS
                  Bold and brave.

                                ARAMIS
                  A poet.

                         (startled)
                  D'Artagnan?
     The name has meaning for all of them. The Musketeers
     look at each other, deadpan, shake their heads.
                                ARAMIS
                  Impossible.

                                PORTHOS
                  It couldn't be.

     Athos knows that it is. He steps forward, extends a
     hand. The others follow, shake as well. Athos intro-
     duces each in turn.

                                ATHOS
                  Athos... Porthos... Aramis.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Pleased to meet you... How do you
                  do?... Good to see you again...
     Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing
     impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The
     Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing
     among them.

                  The Cardinal's Guards.

     D'Artagnan and the Musketeers draw their swords... and
     charge.

42   FIGHT                                                      42
     Suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal combat. Athos
     takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT,
     and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.
     D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself
     face to face with Jussac.
     The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-
     ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords-
     man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire
     also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional
     elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful
     technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic
     ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than
     paint and canvas.
     And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all,
     Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of
     bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo,
     nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill
     of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his
     already impressive size and strength, and you have a one-
     man wrecking crew of epic proportions.
     D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He
     bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver-
     sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-
     rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself
     against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all
     directions at once.
                                JUSSAC
                         (losing patience)
                  Stand still! How do you expect

43   MONASTERY                                                  43

     A monk watches from the bell tower, incensed by the battle
     raging on the field below. He grabs the BELL rope, gives
     it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous ALARM.

                                                           41.

44   BACK TO SCENE                                               44
     Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. He
     produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd
     weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion...
     and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks
     him to the ground.

                             PORTHOS
                      (eyes on the tower)
               Damn monks. Always spoiling
               everybody's fun.

     Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next.
                             ARAMIS
               They are nearer to God...

                             PORTHOS
               They're about to get a little
               nearer to the hilt of my sword.
                               ARAMIS
               Pagan.
                               PORTHOS
               Papist.
     Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents.
     He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat
     struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees
     him, sighs.
                             PORTHOS
                      (to Aramis)
               Excuse me?
                             ARAMIS
               I'm fine, thank you.

     And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile,
     Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers,
     wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls
     to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him,
     indicates d'Artagnan:
                             ARAMIS
               Take a look at our young friend.

                             ATHOS
               You mean he's still alive?

     Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out
     of Jussac.  Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge
     at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's
     sword like a snake and runs him through.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              42.

44   CONTINUED:                                                     44
     Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.    He is dead.

     Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full
     attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable
     them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases
     Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered
     the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos
     -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish
     bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head.
     Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him.
     The color drains from his face.

                                 BISCARAT
                  Now what...?

     Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about
     the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops
     to the ground without a sound.
                                PORTHOS
                  God, I love my work.


45   AFTERMATH                                                      45
     A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan.
     D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending
     over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his
     breath.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (to Athos)
                  What's he doing?

                                ATHOS
                  Last rites. Aramis takes death
                  very seriously.

     Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a
     pouch under his cloak. D'Artagnan sees the other weapons
     there, including a boomerang. Maybe next time.

                                PORTHOS
                         (re: the bolo)
                  Do you know where this bolo comes
                  from?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (a bold jest, given
                          the circumstances)
                  The Queen of America?

                                 PORTHOS
                  Spain.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                 43.

45   CONTINUED:                                                        45
     Porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance.      All for one,
     and one for all. D'Artagnan beams.

                                ARAMIS
                  Don't encourage him. By killing
                  Jussac, the boy's made himself
                  an outlaw too.

                                ATHOS
                  Not if he leaves Paris. Which is
                  exactly what he's going to do.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I can't leave. I just got here.

                                PORTHOS
                  Go home, find a wench, live long
                  and prosper.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Why can't I stay with you?
     Aramis and Porthos look to Athos.      As always, he will
     decide.
                                ATHOS
                  Because I do not want you to.
     It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for
     the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever
     the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers
     mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier
     tone.

                                ARAMIS
                  I know Athos may seem cold and
                  unfriendly, but don't let that
                  fool you.
                                PORTHOS
                  He really is cold and unfriendly.

                                ARAMIS
                  But he's also right. This is our
                  fight, not yours. Go on, get out
                  of here.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Whatever happened to the motto of
                  the Musketeers? 'All for one,
                  and one for all.'

                                  ATHOS
                  Wake up, boy.    The Musketeers are
                  just a dream.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            44.

45   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            45
     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     follow. HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers
     grow small in the distance. Then, sadly, he steps to his
     horse, climbs into the saddle. It has been both the best
     and the worst day of his young life.

     That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the
     corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by
     Rochefort himself. They see their wounded comrades,
     Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the
     distance.

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (pointing)
                  There they go! After them!

     But before Rochefort and the Guards can give chase,
     d'Artagnan rides into the middle of the field to
     challenge them, as if to further prove himself worthy
     of the blue and gold.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (defiant)
                  Long live the Musketeers.
     And d'Artagnan draws his saber.


     AT DISTANCE
     The three Muskeeters rein their horses, look back to
     d'Artagnan's bold charge.
                                PORTHOS
                         (with admiration)
                  Do you believe this kid.

     D'Artagnan gallops toward the Guards to engage them.    He
     races through PISTOL SHOTS like a demon possessed.
     Rochefort rides to the lead, draws his sword.

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (shouts to the
                          others)
                  Fall back! I'll take him myself!

     And like two jousting knights, d'Artagnan and   Rochefort
     meet in the middle of the field. Their BLADES    connect
     with a resounding CLASH, d'Artagnan is knocked   clear of
     his saddle. He hits the ground with a painful    thud.
     Rochefort's Guards leap towards him.

                                                            45.

46   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MUSKEERS                                    46
     Porthos and Aramis are greatly moved by d'Artagnan's
     courage.

                              PORTHOS
                Rochefort's got the boy.

                              ATHOS
                       (seemingly unmoved)
                Too bad.
                              ARAMIS
                You can't just leave him.
     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     exchange sad looks and hopeful comments.

                              ARAMIS
                He has a plan.
                               PORTHOS
                Definitely.   A plan.
     And with that, they gallop after.


47   BACK TO SCENE                                                47
     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan is soon outnumbered, and quickly
     subdued.
                              GUARD
                This boy fights like a wildcat.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (exhausted)
                Thank you.

     The Guard clobbers d'Artagnan with the scabbard of his
     sword. The last thing d'Artagnan sees is the three
     Musketeers riding into the distance. Then the WORLD
     TILTS, GOES SUDDENLY BLACK.

     FADE IN:

48   EXT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                        48

     The walls and towers of France's most infamous prison
     rise to meet a starless sky. The portcullis is raised
     by men-at-arms, admitting a spectacular crimson carriage
     pulled by a team of snow-white stallions. The emblem of
     the Cardinal of France is emblazoned on the carriage
     door, and THROUGH its WINDOW we see the profile of
     Richelieu.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

     Lovingly, he fingers the upholstery of his extravagant
     carriage.

                                                    CUT TO:

49   INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT                                           49

     A chamber in hell. Spiders the size of rats, rats the
     size of small dogs. A foul stench in the air. D'Artagnan
     is sprawled in a corner, unconscious, on a filthy matted
     floor. The sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest.
     D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action.
     As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux.
     He slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches
     for his own. But it is gone.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  My sword --
                                ROCHEFORT
                  It's magnificent. Where did you
                  get it?

     Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring
     d'Artagnan's sword in his hands.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (after a beat)
                  It belonged to my father.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Your father...

     Rochefort studies d'Artagnan for a long moment, then...
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Well now it belongs to me. I
                  collect swords. I take them
                  from the men I kill.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm not dead yet.
     D'Artagnan starts forward. But Rochefort raises the
     sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes,
     feels the sharp tip of the blade.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                  Soon enough.

     Rochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a
     heavy boot. A beat. D'Artagnan peers at his dismal
     surroundings.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll give you a hint. It's not
                  the Louvre.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (realizing)
                  The Bastille! I'm in the Bastille!

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Well, you're the first person who
                  was ever happy to be here.
                  Unfortunately, your visit will be
                  a short one.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What do you mean?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You killed one of the Cardinal's
                  Guards. An offense punishable
                  by death.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He interrupted a duel I was
                  fighting.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Also punishable by death.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  It was a long day.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You know them?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Who?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  The Musketeers.
     D'Artagnan says nothing.     He will not betray them.
     Rochefort leans close.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Tell me where they are, and I
                  will be lenient.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  How?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             48.

49   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             49
                                ROCHEFORT
                         (after a beat)
                  I will give you your father's
                  sword.
     A long beat. D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged
     in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to
     come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts
     downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Give me my father's sword, and
                  I'll cut out your heart.
     Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt
     of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps
     from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                  Fool.   Like your father.
     Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled
     jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles
     on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan,
     inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags
     him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open,
     the jailer reacts with surprise, and...
                                                   CUT TO:
50   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              50
     The jailer exits from d'Artagnan's cell, closes the heavy
     door behind him. A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the
     jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He
     looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the
     OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows.

51   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                 51

     He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con-
     verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell
     doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands
     reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat.
     He shudders, leaps free. And continues.

     D'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated,
     no way out. Just      then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward
     him. D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked
     figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of
     sullen jailers.
     D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                           49.

52   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                       52
     D'Artagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure, the ret-
     inue. He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor
     ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is
     escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and
     toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as
     the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear-
     some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France.

     D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside.
     The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to
     join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal
     and the cloaked figure now behind it.

53   ANGLE TO INCLUDE INTERIOR                                   53

     The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu
     smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner,
     ignored for the moment.
                             RICHELIEU
               I have an errand that requires
               your singular talents.

     The figure rises. The hood falls back... revealing the
     unforgettable features of Milady de Winter. She answers
     the Cardinal's smile with a seductive expression.
                             MILADY
               I was beginning to think you'd
               forgotten me.
                              RICHELIEU
               Forget you?   Impossible.
     Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers
     from the same pit.

54   OUTSIDE DOOR                                                54

     D'Artagnan slips closer, reaches for the handle, finds it
     unlocked. He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear
     close...


55   BACK TO SCENE                                               55
     Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve,
     and hands it to Milady.

                             RICHELIEU
               Carry this to the Duke of
               Buckingham.

                                MILADY
                         (impressed)
                  You did it. An alliance with
                  Buckingham.
                                RICHELIEU
                  The King left me no choice. Now
                  that he's come of age, the boy
                  believes he should rule France.
                  Instead of me.

     Rochefort knows what this portends.    He steps from the
     corner.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You're going to go through with
                  ... everything?
                                RICHELIEU
                         (silences him with
                          a glance)
                  Yes. Everything.
                         (to Milady)
                  You're to leave for Calais at
                  once. A ship called the
                  Persephone will carry you to
                  England. It sails Tuesday,
                  midnight. I want Buckingham's
                  signature next to mine before the
                  King's birthday. Friday.
                                MILADY
                  Consider it done.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And doing so, shall earn you the
                  gratitude of... a King.

     Richelieu's not talking about Louis.    He's talking about
     himself.

                                                     CUT TO:

56   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                56

     D'Artagnan leaps back from the door as it opens, head
     down, shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they
     RETURN TO VIEW. Milady, unrecognizable behind her cloak,
     steps into the corridor, the retinue escorts her forward.
     D'Artagnan falls into place, eyes down, eager for escape.
     Just then: a hand slams down upon his shoulder.
     D'Artagnan looks up into the face of Captain Rochefort.

                                                            51.

58   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                        58

     D'Artagnan lands with a thud at Richelieu's feet.
     Rochefort hisses:
                              ROCHEFORT
                On your knees.

     When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a
     mighty kick. D'Artagnan scrambles into the correct
     posture of supplication. Rochefort continues:

                              ROCHEFORT
                This is the boy who killed
                Jussac.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I can explain that --
                               ROCHEFORT
                Silence!
     Rochefort punches d'Artagnan in the head, knocking him to
     the floor. The Cardinal frowns.

                             RICHELIEU
                Rochefort. Violence solves
                nothing. Leave him to me.
     D'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone.
     Rochefort makes a sullen exit. The Cardinal smiles.
                                RICHELIEU
                Please.    Sit down.
     D'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his
     first movie star. He sits in a finely brocaded chair,
     looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal
     speaks, his manner casual, friendly.
                              RICHELIEU
                How much did you hear?

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (busted)
                Not a word, Your Eminence. I
                stepped from my cell for a breath
                of air, and became lost in the
                corridors, it's dark as you know,
                but then I saw a light up ahead,
                the light over your door, I...

     Richelieu smiles, dismisses d'Artagnan's tale with a
     wave of his hand.

                                RICHELIEU
                  You may have many talents, my
                  young friend. But guile is not
                  one of them. Do you have a name?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                RICHELIEU
                  I've heard that name before.   Are
                  you a Gascon?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes, Your Eminence.
                               RICHELIEU
                  Tell me. What brought you to
                  Paris. And don't say 'a horse.'
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I came to join the King's
                  Musketeers.
                                RICHELIEU
                  Bad timing.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  So I've heard.
                                RICHELIEU
                  D'Artagnan, I like you. I could
                  use a capable young man like you
                  in my Guards.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm honored, Your Eminence, but I
                  don't think I would be very
                  popular with the other men. Not
                  after today.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I suppose not. Your heart is set
                  on being a Musketeer.
                         (off his look)
                  When I was your age, I too had
                  dreams of joining the Musketeers.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (surprised)
                  You, Your Eminence?

                                RICHELIEU
                  Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is
                  the fantasy of every young
                  Frenchman. Or should I say it
                  was...
                         (with seeming
                          kindness, reason)
                  Like the Knights of the Round
                  Table, the Musketeers have
                  outlived their usefulness. They
                  are a thing of the past.
                         (beat)
                  And so have your three friends.
                  Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan,
                  and I will spare your life.

     Richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice.
     D'Artagnan sees it now, replies quietly. No longer in
     awe, but in opposition.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm sorry. But I can't tell you
                  what I do not know.

                                RICHELIEU
                  In that case, give my regards to
                  the headsman.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What about my trial?
                                RICHELIEU
                  You've just had it.

     Richelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him.
     D'Artagnan calls after.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Wait --
                               RICHELIEU
                  Why? Do you object to losing
                  your head?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.   I like it where it is.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Then tell me what I want to know,
                  and perhaps you will keep it there
                  a few years longer.
                         (beat)
                  Where are the three Musketeers?

                  I don't know.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And if you did?

                         (after a beat)
                  I wouldn't tell you.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I admire your courage, young man.
                  You might have made a fine
                  Musketeer after all.

     Richelieu opens the door.       Rochefort waits on the other
     side.
                                RICHELIEU
                  But we'll never know, will we?
     Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly
     by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This
     time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he
     turns to the Captain, commands:
                                RICHELIEU
                  Find the three Musketeers and kill
                  them.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  They'll be dead by dawn.
                                RICHELIEU
                  A comforting thought. Good night,
                  d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning
                  comes quickly.

     With that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark.       HOLD
     ON d'Artagnan for a beat. History's pawn.

                                                    CUT TO:

59   EXT. BASTILLE - MARKET SQUARE - DAY                            59

     BELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution
     scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner
     mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a
     PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad
     black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises
     his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his
     finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his
     bloody thumb.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                         55.

59   CONTINUED:                                                59
     The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's
     victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.

     D'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him,
     in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins
     a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers
     and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head
     high. If he must die, he will die with dignity.

60   TOWER OF BASTILLE                                         60

     Rochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square.
     Richelieu appears beside him.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Milady left at midnight.   By
                  private coach.
                                RICHELIEU
                  A remarkable woman. The most
                  beautiful I've ever known. And
                  the deadliest. Which would
                  explain my attraction.
                         (peering down at
                          the scene)
                  How is our young daredevil holding
                  up?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  He's wishing he'd never heard of
                  the Musketeers.
     Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man-
     at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is
     taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and
     several men-at-arms carrying muskets.

61   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             61

     The Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance
     from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered
     off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains,
     seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand
     grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.

62   SCAFFOLD                                                  62

     D'Artagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the
     stairs to the execution platform. The executioner and
     the Priest wait patiently above. D'Artagnan sees the
     bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie; pales.
     The Priest mutters comfort:
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                             56.

62   CONTINUED:                                                        62
                                PRIEST
                  Fear not, my son...

     D'Artagnan regards the Priest whose face is hidden be-
     neath the brim of his broad black hat. He holds a
     large Bible in his hands.

                                PRIEST
                  For we are with you, always.
     The Priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks.         It
     is Aramis. He whispers:
                                ARAMIS
                  All for one, and one for all...

     D'Artagnan's heart soars. He turns to face the execu-
     tioner. Porthos grins beneath the hood's overhang.
                                CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Prepare the prisoner.
     Porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'Artagnan in a
     threatening manner. He takes him by the scruff of the
     neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block. The
     crowd goes wild.
                                PORTHOS
                         (whispers into his
                          ear)
                  Don't worry, boy. You won't
                  feel a thing.
     The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look.
                                CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Where is Father Rostand today?

                                ARAMIS
                  The good father is... all tied up.

                                 CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Very well.   Proceed.
     Porthos nods.


63   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                     63
     Meanwhile, on the perimeter of the square, two figures
     ride on horseback, they wear familiar cloaks. A CLOSER
     look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through
     the city, towards the countryside beyond. But their
     progress has led them here. Anne frowns at the spectacle.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           57.

63   CONTINUED:                                                   63

                  Barbarism.

                                CONSTANCE
                  Men call it justice.

                                ANNE
                  Are you surprised?
     She replies   with contempt, reins her horse away from the
     square, the   crowd, the executioner's axe. But Constance
     freezes in   place, eyes wide. As d'Artagnan, upon the
     cart, rolls   INTO VIEW.
                               CONSTANCE
                  It's him.

     For just a moment, their eyes lock. Inestimable space
     between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches
     d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises
     his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a
     silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from
     the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source
     of this mayhem.


64   MARKET SQUARE                                                64
     The Cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold,
     scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women
     scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves,
     the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's
     seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP
     in the other... is Athos.
     Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the
     closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out
     a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the
     Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket
     to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of
     nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man-
     at-arms off the scaffold.

65   CARRIAGE                                                     65

     Athos pulls up alongside the scaffold.
                                ATHOS
                         (the usual dour
                          expression, but a
                          hint of levity)
                  Gentlemen, your carriage.
                  Compliments of the Cardinal.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              58.

65   CONTINUED:                                                     65
     D'Artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs
     into the air, landing on the seat beside him. Aramis and
     Porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the
     carriage. The roof fabric tears, they drop into the
     plush interior below. Athos CRACKS the WHIP... and the
     stallions race off through the crowd, towards freedom.


66   SQUARE                                                         66
     Constance watches the escape, transfixed, delighted. As
     the carriage barrels from the scaffold, she thrusts a
     gloved fist into the air, triumphant.
                                 CONSTANCE
                  Yes!


67   TOWER                                                          67

     Athos produces a dagger, cuts the leather ties that bind
     d'Artagnan's wrists.
                                 ATHOS
                  Hold on!

     Athos cracks the whip, driving the horses onward.
                                                    CUT TO:

69   INT. CARRIAGE - DAY                                            69

     Aramis and Porthos have settled in comfortably.      Porthos
     spies a wicker hamper on the floor.
                                PORTHOS
                  Well, what have we here?

     Porthos lifts the lid. Inside: bottles of wine, champagne,
     and a wide assortment of foods.

                                PORTHOS
                  How considerate of the Cardinal
                  to provide us with a snack.

69   CONTINUED:                                                      69
     Porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg.
     Aramis looks about the interior, spies a small ornate
     box.
                                 ARAMIS
                  Hello.

     Aramis opens the box, reacts.        It is filled with gold
     coins, jewelry.
                                ARAMIS
                  How is it that a man of God
                  becomes a man of gold?
                                PORTHOS
                         (looks on, grins)
                  Trinkets for the ladies.
                                 ARAMIS
                  Let's share.

70   STREETS OF PARIS - CARRIAGE                                     70

     Aramis sticks his head through the hole in the fabric
     roof, hands the ornate box to d'Artagnan.
                                ARAMIS
                  Would you be so good as to
                  distribute these? Your generosity
                  will be greatly appreciated.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (open the box, reacts)
                  But...?
                                ARAMIS
                         (to the point)
                  Throw the coins, boy.     The people
                  are hungry.

     D'Artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into
     the air. Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the
     carriage interior. Pedestrians see the gold, shout, and
     leap after. Their hurried steps impede the Guards' pro-
     gress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. But several of
     the Guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the
     carriage with renewed determination. D'Artagnan hears a
     LOUD POPPING sound, ducks.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  They're firing at us!

70   CONTINUED:                                                    70
     Porthos sticks his head INTO VIEW, offers them a bubbling
     bottle of champagne, the source of the popping sound.

                               PORTHOS
                  Champagne?

                                ATHOS
                  You know I prefer wine.
                                PORTHOS
                  Don't go away.

     Porthos ducks down, returns with a new bottle.
                                PORTHOS
                  May I recommend this find
                  Cabernet?
     Porthos hands   the bottle to Athos. Athos hands the reins
     to d'Artagnan.    D'Artagnan struggles with the reins, tries
     to control the   horses. And beams, taking delight from
     every instant   of adventure. Athos SMASHES the top of the
     BOTTLE, drinks   deeply, settles back to enjoy himself.

                                ATHOS
                  Turn right at the next street.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The next right...?
                               ATHOS
                  Turn.
     Athos growls, d'Artagnan jerks at the reins. The carriage
     careens around the corner, tipping on two wheels.

     Porthos looks up from his chest, champagne spilled all
     over his tunic... and a brand new sash.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to Aramis)

     The carriage charges up a steep hill. At the summit, Athos
     tosses aside his bottle, takes the reins from d'Artagnan.

     D'Artagnan sighs with relief. Athos yanks the brake
     lever, brings the horses to a halt, and leaps down from
     the driver's seat. D'Artagnan follows. Athos pulls the
     passenger door open, revealing Porthos and Aramis inside.
     Gold coins on the carpet at their feet, food and drink
     between them.

                                ATHOS
                  Gentlemen, this is the end of the
                  line. I hope you had a pleasant
                  ride.
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  Unhitch the horses.

                  But the Guards.

     D'Artagnan points to the bottom of the hill.       The mounted
     Guards chase after, begin their ascent.
                                 ATHOS
                  Do as I say.
     D'Artagnan hurries to the horses. Porthos and Aramis
     climb from the cab. Porthos emits a contented belch.
                                ATHOS
                         (to Aramis)
                  Your pistol and powder, please.
     Aramis hands Athos a sack of powder, and his pistol.
     Athos tosses the sack into the carriage, takes aim with
     the PISTOL, and SHOOTS it -- igniting the powder inside.

                                 ATHOS
                  Stand back.

     The interior of the Cardinal's carriage bursts into
     flames.

     D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers mount the Cardinal's
     white stallions, race off into the distance. Porthos
     shouts, laughing.

                                PORTHOS
                  I'd give five years of your life

     The Cardinal's face is contorted in fury. He    steps out of
     a horse cart, approaches the charred remains   of his be-
     loved carriage. He stares at the smouldering    ruin for a
     long beat. Rochefort and a company of Guards    stand near-
     by, wait for him to speak. When he does, his    tone is
     measured and calm.

                             RICHELIEU
               One thousand pistoles on each of
               their heads, dead or alive. The
               boy knows our plans.

     Rochefort reacts with surprise.

     D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers rest against tree
     trunks in a hidden glade, polish off the last of the
     Cardinal's food and drink. Their usual cynicism replaced
     by something approaching camaraderie. Aramis smiles as
     d'Artagnan attacks a turkey wing.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I haven't eaten in three days.
               I guess with all the excitement,
               I forgot.
                             ARAMIS
               Your trip from home has been an
               eventful one.

                             D'ARTAGNAN
                      (he can't quite

               I heard of a d'Artagnan once. He
               was a captain in the Musketeers
               when we were just recruits.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               He was my father.

                             ARAMIS
               A good man, I'm told.

                             PORTHOS

               familiar about this boy.

                         (sadly)
                  He died when I was nine.
     The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall.
     D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  All my mother would tell me is
                  that he died in the service of
                  the King.

     An uncomfortable silence.     It is Athos who finally speaks:
                                ATHOS
                  D'Artagnan, your father and another
                  Musketeer were ambushed and
                  murdered outside the Louvre.
     D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent.      He manages a
     broken whisper:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  This other Musketeer -- is he
                  still alive? I'd like to talk
                  to him.
     Athos shakes his head.     Porthos adds:

                                PORTHOS
                  You already have. His name is
                  the Count De Rochefort.
     D'Artagnan isn't listening. He stands suddenly, turns,
     and walks away. He doesn't want the Musketeers to see
     the tears forming in his eyes. Aramis shouts after:

                                ARAMIS
                  D'Artagnan.

     D'Artagnan stands at a flowing stream, wipes the tears
     from his eyes. Aramis appears at his side, offers silent
     comfort, a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.

                  the man who murdered my father
                  and kill him where he stands.

                                ARAMIS
                  A man is better measured by his
                  life than by his death. Your
                  father was bold, and brave.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But you never knew him...

                  He lives in you.
     That's all the evidence Aramis requires.       D'Artagnan
     pauses to reflect. Then wonders:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  And your father?

                                ARAMIS
                  I was orphaned at a young age.
                  The church took me in.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You didn't have one.
                                ARAMIS
                  But I did. He was a great man,
                  a leader of the church. And his
                  example inspired me to dedicate
                  my life to God's service.

     Aramis opens his cloak, reveals a priestly cloth.       A
     secret he carries near to his heart.
                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  This great man, this father,
                  betrayed the church, and turned
                  his back on God. To worship power
                  and gold.

     Richelieu nods, he already knows.       He picks up one of

     three Musketeers,    riding hell-for-leather. HOLD ON this
     heroic tableau for    a long beat.

80   EXT. BRIDGE ON ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                         80

     Four rough-looking MERCENARIES crouch on a low bridge
     spanning a shallow stream. They are armed with muskets
     and swords. The Mercenaries wait in the darkness, whisper
     eagerly among themselves.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             68.

80   CONTINUED:                                                    80
     One of them hisses for silence, all conversation ends.
     And the sound of HOOFBEATS is heard in the distance.
     Faint, but growing closer.
                                MERCENARY
                  Shoot low. We'll need their
                  heads for identification.

     The Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. Right on
     cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist. But
     just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen
     break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to
     the right. Before the Mercenaries realize what's
     happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing
     through the shallow stream. In a flash, they return to
     the road, and race away. Having avoided the bridge
     completely.
     Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about, FIRE at
     d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into
     the night. Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.
                                                   CUT TO:


81   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                   81
     An overturned wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter
     the roadway. The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on
     one of the kegs, holding his head. D'Artagnan and the
     Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a stop.
                                FARMER
                         (with relief)
                  Thank God for a friendly face.
                  My horse broke loose. Can you
                  help me move these kegs out of
                  the road?
     D'Artagnan starts to dismount.

                                ATHOS
                  Stay on your horse.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He needs our help.

                                 ATHOS
                  Don't worry.   We'll help him.

     Suddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing
     muskets. The ragged Farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls
     out a pistol, makes a smirking request:
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            69.

                                FARMER
                  Won't you step down... Musketeers?

                                ARAMIS
                  Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put
                  away your weapons and remove these
                  kegs from the road. We'd prefer
                  to ride on without having to kill
                  you.
     D'Artagnan and the "Farmers" gape at Aramis in surprise.

                                FARMER
                  You're threatening us?

                                PORTHOS
                  It's not a threat, it's a fact.
                  If you don't haul those kegs away,
                  you're dead where you stand.
     The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol
     and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the
     trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of
     Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
     When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the
     three dead "Farmers" sprawled in the road and the three
     pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the
     Musketeers.
                                PORTHOS
                  Mine hit the ground first.
                                ATHOS
                  Mine was taller.
     Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform
     last rites over the bodies. D'Artagnan still can't be-
     lieve what just happened. He turns to Porthos. Porthos
     raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.

                                PORTHOS
                  There's only one rule, d'Artagnan
                  -- stay alive.

     THUNDER RUMBLES and RAINS begins to fall.

82   INT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT                                     82

     A large warm tavern with a ROARING FIRE.

     Present are the INNKEEPER, his wife, a few benighted tra-
     velers and THREE BARMAIDS. They turn as the door flies
     open and the Musketeers and d'Artagnan enter from a RAGING
     STORM. They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear
     the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces.

     The occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with
     suspicion. Outisde, the STORM BLOWS. D'Artagnan closes
     the heavy door. Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to
     meet the four ominous travelers.

                                  INNKEEPER
                  Good evening.
                                ATHOS
                  See to our horses and bring us
                  some food.
                                INNKEEPER
                         (apologetic)
                  I'm sorry but we have little to
                  spare. The Cardinal's Guards were
                  here today. They helped
                  themselves to our food and then
                  refused to pay.
                                ARAMIS
                         (bitter)
                  In the name of God, I'm sure.
     Porthos is on the lookout for danger. He reaches inside
     his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally
     exposes his Musketeer tunic.

                                BARMAID #1
                         (crying out)
                  Musketeers!

     The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and
     d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. They stand
     back to back in a circle, ready for attack.

     But there is no attack. Quite the contrary.       The people
     here are thrilled to see them.

                                INNKEEPER
                         (honored)
                  Musketeers in my house! Gentlemen,
                  put away your swords and come in.
                  Anyone who fights the Cardinal is
                  welcome here.

     The Musketeers lower their swords.

                                ARAMIS
                  I think we've found a home.

     The Musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and
     take off their dripping hats and capes. The pretty
     Barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and car-
     ry it to the fire.

                                INNKEEPER
                  We don't have much but what we
                  have is yours.

     Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself.
     He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly
     voice.

                                PORTHOS
                  Ladies, you're in for a treat
                  tonight. Allow me to introduce
                  myself. I'm the Musketeer they
                  call Porthos.
     Porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing
     happens. The Barmaids look at each other.
                                PORTHOS
                         (repeating; louder)
                  Porthos.

     Still no response.    Aramis and d'Artagnan hide smiles.
                                ARAMIS
                  It's hard to believe they haven't
                  heard of the great Porthos.
                                PORTHOS
                  Oh, shut up, Aramis.

     The three Barmaids perk up.
                                BARMAIDS
                         (with excitement)
                  Aramis? Did you say Aramis?
     And with that, the three Barmaids desert Porthos and
     scurry across the room to attach themselves to Aramis.
     Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.
                                PORTHOS
                  I don't get it. I just don't
                  get it.

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                             72.

83   INT. TAVERN - NIGHT                                           83
     Moments later.   Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale.

                             PORTHOS
               I said, 'A Queen is no different
               than a barmaid in the dark. Though
               less... practiced in the arts of
               pleasure...'

     The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee.
     But d'Artagnan isn't so sure. Porthos, with two Barmaids,
     bellows a reply.

                             PORTHOS
               If you're going to be a proper
               Musketeer, you'll have to learn
               the manly art of wenching. Right,
               ladies?
     The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over
     Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-
     ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
                             PORTHOS
               Ahh, very good. Your first
               subject. But you'll need
               instruction. Watch closely.
     Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings
     her lips toward his.
                             PORTHOS
               The secret to wenching is the
               first kiss. For in that kiss, a
               lasting impression is made. If it
               is weak, she will think you are
               weak. And if it is comical, she
               will think you are a clown. With
               me?
                               D'ARTAGNAN
               Weak... weak.    Comical... clown.

                              PORTHOS
               Very good.   And as a Musketeer is
               never weak,  and only rarely a
               clown, your  first kiss must be all
               the things  that you are. Like
               this...
     Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it,
     turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.

                  You may speak first if you like,
                  your name, her name, an endearment
                  or two. But words are usually a
                  waste of time.

                                ARAMIS
                  Only if you don't know which words
                  to say.
     All turn to regard Aramis. He'll play along too.
     Porthos reacts with delight. D'Artagnan with interest.
     Aramis continues:
                                ARAMIS
                  Words may make a more lasting
                  impression than a thousand of
                  Porthos' kisses.
                                BARMAID
                         (still reeling)
                  Not likely.
                                ARAMIS
                  I'll demonstrate. Please.   Sit
                  beside me.
     Aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these en-
     virons as it is persuasive. The Barmaid slips from
     Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him.
     Aramis does not touch her. He simply looks into her
     eyes... and begins to speak.
                                ARAMIS
                  'Shall I compare thee to a

                     buds of May,

                  Nor lose possession of that fair
                     thou owest,

                  So long lives this, and this gives
                     life to thee.'

     The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. Her face
     covered with tears. Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by
     the outcome. He turns to d'Artagnan, cites:

                                 ARAMIS
                  Shakespeare.
                                PORTHOS
                  That's cheating.
     The Barmaid on his lap disagrees.

                                BARMAID
                  It's beautiful.
     D'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the
     room. Porthos urges him on.
                                PORTHOS
                  Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't
                  got all night.

     D'Artagnan steps forward. The dark-haired Barmaid sees
     him coming and smiles. D'Artagnan stands before her,
     hesitates, not sure where to start. Then, remembering as
     best he can:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  'Shall I compare thee to a summer's
                    day?
                  Thou are move lovely and more
                     tempest, er, more tempered...'
                         (beat)
                  Ahh, to hell with it --

     D'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a
     powerful kiss. As previously demonstrated. Porthos and
     Aramis smile proudly. The Barmaids cheer.

                                PORTHOS
                  The boy's a natural.

                  So little time, so much to learn.

     D'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at
     a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle
     of Burgundy.

                                ARAMIS
                  In all the years I've know him...
                  I have never seen Athos smile.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Why is he sitting by himself?
                                PORTHOS
                  Athos takes his drinking seriously.
                  Ignore him. He'll be his usual
                  warm, charming self by morning.
                         (calls out)
                  Service! My lap is cold!
     A Barmaid scurries INTO   VIEW. Porthos grabs her by the
     waist, adds the Barmaid   to the one already sitting on his
     lap. The chair breaks    beneath them, and all three go
     sprawling on the floor,   laughing heartily.

84   ATHOS                                                         84

     He remains lost in drink. D'Artagnan appears beside him.
     He hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  Come join us.
     Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.     He fills
     his flagon for him.

                                ATHOS
                  You fight like a Musketeer. Let's
                  see if you can drink like one.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'll drink anything you put in
                  front of me.

                                ATHOS
                  Famous last words.
                         (raising his flagon)
                  What shall we drink to?

     D'Artagnan notices the dark-haired Barmaid eyeing him
     across the room.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Love?

     The word nearly makes Athos grimace. He stares at
     d'Artagnan for a long beat, then beyond. As if to look
     into another time and place. Finally:

                               ATHOS
                  Love.
                         (beat)
                  Would you like to hear a story,
                  d'Artagnan? A love story?
     Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain
     he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He
     nearly whispers:

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.
     Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy,
     wipes the blood red wine from his lips.
                                ATHOS
                  I once knew a man... one of the
                  Counts of Berry. My native
                  province. When the good Count was
                  about your age, he fell in love
                  with a visitor from Paris. A
                  breathtaking girl of seventeen.
                  She was more than beautiful,
                  d'Artagnan. She was...
                  intoxicating. And this man, the
                  poor idiot, he married her.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Isn't that what people do when
                  they fall in love?
                                ATHOS
                         (sharply)
                  Be quiet and listen.
                         (beat)
                  The Count took her to his castle
                  and made her the first lady of the
                  province. They were happy for a
                  time, as happy as a man and a
                  woman can be. Then one day, while
                  riding in the woods, the girl was
                  thrown from her horse, and knocked
                  unconscious. The Count hurried to
                  help her. Her dress was torn.

                  On her her arm, the woman wore a
                  gold band in the shape of a
                  serpent. It was the only article
                  of clothing she refused to remove.
                  The Count's curiosity got the best
                  of him. He reached over and slid
                  down the gold band. He saw
                  something on her arm... something
                  she'd kept hidden 'til then...

                               D'ARTAGNAN

                  The fleur d'lis. She'd been
                  branded...

     D'Artagnan reacts with shock.
                                ATHOS
                  The Count's angel turned out to be
                  a murderess who escaped the
                  Executioner's blade. She swore
                  that she loved him. Swore that
                  she had changed. And if he would
                  just keep her secret, they would
                  live a long life together.
     Athos pauses, imagines that life.      The Count and his
     angel.
                                ATHOS
                  But the Count was young and he was
                  stupid. He was tormented by the
                  ridicule of his social class. And
                  so he rejected her. For her lies
                  and for her past.
                         (beat)
                  And turned her over to the
                  authorities to be executed for the
                  crime.

     Athos now turns his unflinching gaze on d'Artagnan.
                                ATHOS
                  But you see... his heart did not
                  agree.  The Count soon realized
                  what she had meant to him. And
                  what he had done.

                  greater than her own.
                         (beat)
                  Soon after he foreswore the
                  society that shaped him. Gave up
                  his title. And was never seen
                  again.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  He loved her.

                                ATHOS
                  He killed her. It seemed like the
                  same thing after a while.

     HOLD ON Athos for a long time.       As he gathers up his pain,
     and puts it back again.
     Athos SMASHES open another BOTTLE. But the story has
     made d'Artagnan quite sober and a little sick to his
     stomach. He refuses another drink.
                                 ATHOS
                  Good.   More for me.
                                PORTHOS
                  Aramis -- play something with some
                  blood in it! I feel like dancing!
     Aramis launches into something appropriate. Porthos and
     a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance.
     Porthos is damned good. His joie de vivre is infectious
     and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging
     him. Every once in awhile, another WEAPON -- a dagger or
     something -- drops out of Porthos' clothing and hits the
     floor with a CLATTER.

     That's when Porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of
     control, trips and falls on Athos' table, crushing it to
     the floor.

     Porthos lies in the wreckage, staring up. Athos, totally
     unperturbed, looks down and offers him the bottle.

                                PORTHOS
                  Care to dance, Athos?
                                ATHOS
                  Only if I can lead.

     Porthos blinks in amazement at Athos' grim face, then
     breaks out laughing.
                                 PORTHOS
                  Aramis!   Athos made a joke!

     The Innkeeper comes down the stairs wearing a nightshirt
     and a sleepy expression.

              It's dawn.
     They turn in disbelief to the shuttered windows. Sure
     enough. Sunlight is peeking in through the cracks.

     The sun rises, casts long shadows across a sparkling dew-
     wet field. D'Artagnan and the Musketeers ride INTO
     FRAME, continuing their journey to Calais. D'Artagnan
     squints ahead, wincing with every bump. Porthos grins.
                            PORTHOS
              Beautiful morning, eh, d'Artagnan?

     D'Artagnan is terribly hung-over from the night's
     carousing. He looks like he could puke at any moment.
     So that's exactly why Porthos shouts to him and says...

                              PORTHOS
              You know,   d'Artagnan, it's not a
              good idea   to travel on an empty
              stomach.    You really should have
              had a big   portion of those sheep's
              brains...

     D'Artagnan covers his mouth.    Porthos laughs good-
     naturedly.

              My head feels like it's filled

                  A connon ball.

     Athos is cut off by an EAR-PIERCING WHISTLE as a CANNON
     BALL drops out of the sky and STRIKES the ground nearby,
     sending up a tremendous EXPLOSION.
                                PORTHOS
                  I hate cannon balls.

     Another BALL EXPLODES into the ground in front of them.
     Their horses rear up in fear, threatening to dump them
     out of their saddles. As the Musketeers and d'Artagnan
     struggle to control their horses, they look back and see
     an old castle atop a distant hill.
     A group of men operate two rusted cannons, left over from
     some long-forgotten war.
     The Musketeers barely calm their horses, when another
     BALL comes SCREAMING their way, IMPACTING a few feet
     away. As dirt rains upon them:

                                ARAMIS
                         (to d'Artagnan)

                  I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal
                  had chopped if off.

                                ATHOS
                  Stay with us, and you just might
                  get your wish.
     Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and
     the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle-
     ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six
     horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He
     changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after.

     They ride as fast their mounts will carry them. A cross-
     roads up ahead. Athos sizes up the situation, shouts
     command.
                                ATHOS
                  Split in half! D'Artagnan rides
                  with me!

     D'Artagnan nods, thrilled to go with Athos.
                                ARAMIS
                  We'll see you in Calais!
                               ATHOS
                  Or hell!

     Athos and d'Artagnan take off in one direction, Porthos
     and Aramis in the other. The pursuing horsemen soon
     race INTO VIEW, break in half to give chase.

     A room heavy with mist and steam. Behind a maze of gauze
     screens, we discover Anne reclining in a large tiled bath,
     Constance attending. Constance replenishes the bath with
     pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron.
     In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends:
                                CONSTANCE
                  But how, your Majesty? How can
                  you tell if you're really in love?
                                ANNE
                  Do you think about him all the
                  time?

                  Yes.
                                ANNE
                  And when he's around, do your
                  knees feel as weak as water?

                               CONSTANCE
                  Yes.

                                ANNE
                  And when he looks at you, do you
                  suddenly forget how to breathe?

                  Then you're in love.

                                 CONSTANCE
                          (thrilled by the
                           knowledge; knew it
                           all alone)
                  I am.

     Anne turns to Constance, soap and water swirl about her
     naked body. She wonders:

                                ANNE
                  Who is he?
                                CONSTANCE

                                ANNE
                  Of course I will.

                                CONSTANCE
                  You won't.
                                ANNE
                  Who?
                                CONSTANCE
                  The young man who rescued us from
                  the bandit.

                                ANNE
                  The young man on the scaffold?

                          water, peers ahead)
                  You're right. I don't believe it.

     A warm beat. Anne and Constance are friends as much as
     they are Queen and subject.
                                CONSTANCE
                  Are you in love, Your Majesty?

     simple.

                                ANNE
                  My love... is a matter of state.
                  It's complicated.

     Wistful, she replies:

     Anne steps to a dressing chamber, wearing a long robe,
     arranging her thick wet hair into braids.
                                ANNE

     Anne stops short. Cardinal Richelieu waits for her in
     the dressing chamber, now bows, assumes a supplicant air.

     Richelieu allows the jest, remains silent, watchful.
     Anne resumes, chooses her words with care.
                                ANNE
                  Of course. As Your Eminence has

                         (nods assent)
                  It's the least I can do.

                  in the Antilles and Cayenne. The
                  coming war with France. These are
                  not the usual hobbies of youth.

                  It sounds as though he is
                  concerned with more important
                  matters.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Which is exactly why we must
                  celebrate.
                         (off her look)
                  To show the world that the King of
                  France is strong enough to face
                  any enemy on any field. To show
                  France... that he is King.
                         (beat)
                  He will listen to you. If you
                  will speak.
     Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming
     loyalty. Anne considers, replies, noncommittal:
                                ANNE
                  I will speak to him.
     Anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface.
     The conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb
     her.

                                ANNE

     Anne nods, turns back toward the chambers.       Richelieu
     calls after.

                  an important matter of state.

     Richelieu never allows the mask to slip. Even for an
     instant. Louis glances at the throne room, the increasing
     number of Cardinal's Guards on duty. They make him feel
     uncomfortable. Louis speaks with renewed determination.

                                LOUIS

                  robbing and killing innocent
                  people.

                  No mistake. I have reports from
                  the local constables involved.

     Richelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No
     doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He
     takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness.

     Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching
     below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to
     another matter of business.

                                LOUIS

                  some very troubling rumors about
                  you.

     Richelieu nods, not the least bit concerned.
                                RICHELIEU
                  There are so many to choose from.
                  Is it the one about my alleged
                  alliance with Buckingham? Let's
                  see if I remember it correctly.
                  While the English attack from
                  without, I'll undermine the throne
                  from within -- depose you -- and
                  become sovereign of France myself.
                  That rumor, Your Majesty?

     Richelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.
                                LOUIS
                  It does seem rather farfetched.

                  If there are any doubts of my
                  loyalty, they'll be put to rest
                  when we appear together at your
                  birthday celebration.

                                LOUIS
                  I've been thinking about that. A
                  birthday celebration when we're
                  on the brink of war...

                                RICHELIEU
                         (alert, ready for
                          this as well)
                  Your subjects are eager to
                  celebrate the birth of their King
                  at a time like this.
                                LOUIS
                  I'm not so eager.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I have an idea. Why don't you
                  discuss the matter with your
                  Queen?
     Louis looks up, wonders. As Richelieu draws him deeper
     into his spider's strategems.

93   EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                  93

     Porthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their
     shoulders. They crest the top of a bluff, rein their
     horses to a stop. They can afford to rest for a moment.
     Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them.
                                ARAMIS
                  My horse will not survive another
                  league.
                               PORTHOS
                  And you?

                         (in kind)
                  Ten, twenty at the most.

     Porthos looks into the near distance, manages a weary
     smile.

                                PORTHOS
                  Here's just the thing.     A nice,
                  relaxing boat ride.
     At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the
     bank of a swift, choppy river.

                                                       CUT TO:

94   EXT. RIVER AND FERRY LANDING - DAY                                94

     The ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about
     fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the
     other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the
     trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes.

     As Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re-
     turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather-
     beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across
     -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country
     WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip,
     the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely
     jostling the Woman and her child to the rear.
     The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and
     scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss
     to his way.

                                FERRYMAN
                  A privilege to carry you on my
                  humble boat...
     The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child.
                                  FERRYMAN
                  Two pistoles.

                                WOMAN
                  But I only have one. Couldn't
                  my child ride free? She's so
                  small...
                                FERRYMAN
                         (hand outstretched,
                          demanding)
                  Two pistoles.
     A courtly voice intervenes.

                                ARAMIS
                  Put away your money, madame. You
                  and your child will cross the
                  river under our protection. For
                  free.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         90.

94   CONTINUED:                                                 94
     All turn to regard Aramis on horseback, Porthos at his
     side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise. The
     Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and
     protests.
                                FERRYMAN
                  Nobody rides for free! Under
                  your protection bloody well
                  indeed! I'll teach you a thing
                  or two about protection! Apple-
                  cheeked young fools!! -- Just who
                  do you think you are!!
                                ARAMIS
                         (waits for the
                          tirade to cease;
                          simply)
                  Musketeers.
     Two two Cavaliers react to the word. The Ferryman does,
     too -- into cringing, obedient servant.
                                FERRYMAN
                  Musketeers? Well, why didn't you
                  say so? Of course you'll ride for
                  free. I insist on it. This way,
                  pretty madame. My what a lovely
                  little girl...

                               ARAMIS
                  Porthos!
                               PORTHOS
                  What?
     Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so
     he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the
     hill on their horses.
                               PORTHOS
                  We sail!

     And with that, Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom-
     erang and brings it down on the dock rope. The rope
     splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock.


95   HILL AND SHORE                                             95
     The pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of
     the dock but they're too late. Porthos and Aramis have
     gotten away.

                                                          91.
96   FLATBOAT                                                   96
     Porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers. Aramis
     ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them
     for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what
     Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them
     with keen interest.
                             FIRST CAVALIER
               You're those Musketeers everyone's
               been looking for.

                              PORTHOS
                Popularity has its price.

     The First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask.
                              FIRST CAVALIER
                I have some excellent brandy here.
                Would you gentlemen care to drink
                a toast with us to the Cardinal?
                              PORTHOS
                We'd be happy to.
     Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak.
                              PORTHOS
                If you'll drink one with us to
                the King.
                              SECOND CAVALIER
                But the only King we recognize...
                is the Cardinal.
                              ARAMIS
                There are those who would call
                that treason.
                              FIRST CAVALIER
                Happily, no such objections have
                been raised... here.
                               PORTHOS
                All right.   I'll object.

                              SECOND CAVALIER
                I'm listening.

                              PORTHOS
                Let's see. You are, by your dress
                and by your manner, members of a
                bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers
                whose slavish allegiance to His
                Eminence the Cardinal is as that
                of a dog who likes nothing better
                than to sniff today where he has
                peed the day before.

                  I was momentarily inspired.

     The Cavaliers are not amused. The first replies in
     measured tones, his lips white with fury.

                                 FIRST CAVALIER
                  May I reply?

                  By all means.
                                FIRST CAVALIER
                  Better to be a dog in the service
                  of a great master, than a beef-
                  witted moron so dazzled by the
                  throne that he does not see the
                  true nature of the foolish boy
                  who wobbles atop it. Which is to
                  say, that most muddy-brained of
                  all men... a Musketeer.
     The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords.
     Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own. Porthos
     deadpans:
                                PORTHOS
                  Maybe there's something  about us
                  that just pisses people  off. At
                  least I'd like to think  so. It's
                  too bad we can only kill  them
                  once.

97   FIGHT                                                       97

     The middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the
     best place for a duel. But the combatants make the most
     of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with
     everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent
     swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the
     Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must
     keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.

     Porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a
     devilish grin, chases him between -- and at one point,
     over -- blindfolded horses.
     Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re-
     ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the
     child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of
     the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a
     neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with
     one arm while continuing to do battle with the other.
     He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.

     The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the
     flatboat deck. Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle,
     breathless. Porthos complains:

                                PORTHOS
                  I've been called a lot of things

                  But beef-witted is a little more

                  What?
     Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat
     approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and
     muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's
     Guards.

                                  ARAMIS
                  Can you swim?

                  No.   My horse can.
                                  ARAMIS
                  That'll do.

     Aramis hurries to    his horse, takes off the blindfold.
     Porthos grumbles    after, follows suit. They leap atop
     their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they
     guide them to the    edge.
                                ARAMIS

                  No, no.   Please. After you.

     Stalemate. Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos
     grin. Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest. They
     count...

                                ARAMIS AND PORTHOS
                  One, two -- three!
     And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look
     on, Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging
     river. The Woman whispers after:
                                 WOMAN
                  Thank you.   God speed.
     Porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance.


98   ON SHORE                                                       98
     The Cardinal's Guards react with anger and disbelief.


99   RIVER                                                          99
     A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER. Porthos clinging to
     his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on his
     fellow Musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead.
     Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge
     boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... Aramis and Porthos
     finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. They
     lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land...
     and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of
     Cardinal's Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their
     arrival.
     Porthos looks down at his latest sash -- destroyed like
     the others. Aramis draws his saber, mutters.

                                ARAMIS
                  A nice relaxing boat ride...

      And with that, Aramis and Porthos charge towards the
      Guards.

100   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY                                         100

      Cool, clear water. WIDEN to reveal d'Artagnan and Athos
      at a shallow pond, watering their horses. The forest
      around them is dark and primeval.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Do you think we've lost them?
                                 ATHOS
                   They'll catch up eventually.

      To the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at
      their beautiful surroundings, remembers:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   My father used to hunt in a forest
                   like this. He promised to take me
                   on my tenth birthday. I don't know
                   why he picked that year. Something
                   about a boy becoming a man. I'd
                   lay in bed at night and imagine it,
                   just the two of us. But he died
                   before I could go with him.
      Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with
      quiet cynicism:
                                 ATHOS
                   Well. You have your boyhood wish
                   at last. The dark forest. The
                   thrill of the hunt. The nearness
                   of death.
      Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'd be proud to die for my King.
                                 ATHOS
                   I just wanted to save you from the
                   life of a Musketeer. You don't
                   have to go looking for experience,
                   d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon
                   enough. And when it does -- it
                   will mark you forever.

      Athos rides into the forest.    D'Artagnan hurries to
      follow.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                          96.

101   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                         101
      Athos leads d'Artagnan through the forest. Sunbeams
      shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. A
      pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING
      HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see
      SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.


102   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             102
      Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest.
      The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes
      d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.
      Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at
      the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all
      around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-
      gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the
      crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with
      Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a
      SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others
      curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ
      back and forth like angry hornets.
      Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.
      The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to
      tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:
                              ATHOS
                I'll hold them off for as long as
                I can. Go on without me.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I can't leave you here. Not like
                this.

                              ATHOS
                Ride to Calais and stop the
                Cardinal's agent.

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Athos... I can't.

      Athos points his pistol at d'Artagnan.
                              ATHOS
                Go, or I'll kill you myself.

      A few days ago, d'Artagnan would have obeyed without
      question. Fearful, if nothing else. But not here, not
      now.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                A duel then.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               97.

102   CONTINUED:                                                     102
                                 ATHOS
                   You're insane.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   We never finished the first.

                                 ATHOS
                   All right. I'll toss a coin.
                   Tails I stay, heads you remain.
                   Agreed?

      D'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He
      produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and
      hand. And looks between.


103   ATHOS AND HIS POV                                              103
      Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain.       Athos looks up without
      missing a beat.
                                   ATHOS
                   Tails.    I stay.

      Athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving
      d'Artagnan a chance to see.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   But...?
      Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the
      kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express
      it. And that there is no use arguing with him.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   At least take my pistol.

      He gives it to Athos.      They clasp hands.
                                 ATHOS
                          (gruff; yet proud)
                   Don't let us down... Musketeer.
      There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.       He knows Athos
      hasn't got a chance.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (a choke of emotion)
                   I'll never forget you.

                                  ATHOS
                   Go!
      Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman.       D'Artagnan
      runs to his MOUNT, GALLOPS away.

                                                               98.

104   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     104
      He rides, straining to hear the sounds of GUNFIRE. As
      long as the SHOTS continue, he knows Athos is alive.
      Abruptly... the SHOTS CEASE.
      D'Artagnan swallows his heart, and rides.

                                                     CUT TO:

105   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                    105

      A lonely stretch of road, illuminated by moonlight. A
      signpost announces: CALAI 15 LEAGUES. An exhausted
      HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the
      saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes
      open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from
      his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He
      opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then
      closes them.
      We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING.
      The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt
      just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we
      can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback,
      bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de
      Winter.
                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   What is it, Henri?
                                 HENRI (DRIVER)
                   There's a body in the road, Milady.
                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   Be careful.
      Pistols are cocked.    Henri's shadow falls across
      d'Artagnan's body.
                                 HENRI
                   It's a young man. He appears to
                   be injured.
      We hear the CARRIAGE DOOR OPEN.     FOOTSTEPS to d'Artagnan's
      side.

                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   My, what a handsome boy. Put him
                   inside with me.

      Strong hands grasp d'Artagnan and lift him from the cold
      ground.
                                                     CUT TO:

106   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV - BLACK SCREEN                             106
      Out of the darkness, a face appears,   BLURRY and OBSCURED.
      It FILLS the SCREEN, slowly swimming   INTO FOCUS. It is
      Milady de Winter, even more beautiful   in CLOSEUP.
      Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory   combs gleam in her
      hair. She smiles warmly.

                                MILADY
                Welcome back.    Did you dream?

107   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               107

      reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn.
      D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped
      up in a large bed. He blinks into the face of Milady
      who sits at the edge. His eyes widen with recognition,
      faint awe.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                You.
                                MILADY
                Have we met?

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I... saw you in Paris.
      D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged.
      He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the
      grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table.
      D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Where am I...?
                              MILADY
                This is Calais.

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (with a jolt)
                Calais!
                       (muttered; to self)
                The ship... Tuesday at midnight...
      D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark
      naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet
      around him.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (frantic)
                Where are my clothes?

                                 MILADY
                   Filthy. I'm having them cleaned.
                   Is something wrong?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What day is it? What time?!

      D'Artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters.
      Beyond: the harbor lights of the Port of Calais.
                                 MILADY
                   It's Tuesday, near nine.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Nine?   Are you sure?

      Somewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.        Milady
      smiles.
                                 MILADY
                   Quite sure.
      D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.        Milady rises from the bed.
      She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and
      silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly. En-
      joying his discomfort, Milady       crosses the room, joins
      him at the window.
                                 MILADY
                   Are you in a hurry?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (after a beat)
                   How did I... get here?
                                 MILADY
                   I found you in the road.
                   Discarded. Like an unwanted
                   kitten. Do you have a name or
                   shall I make one up for you?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (nervous)
                   My name is d'Artagnan.

                                 MILADY
                   D'Artagnan. I like that. I am
                   the Countess de Winter. Milady.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Countess?

                                 MILADY
                   My husband's dead.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm sorry.

                                 MILADY
                   I have learned to live with death.

      She manages to combine sympathy, seduction, and just a
      hint of danger. All in a single reply. D'Artagnan
      hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Countess, I'm very grateful for
                   what you've done, but I can't stay
                   here. I've got...

                                 MILADY
                   What...?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Important business.
                                 MILADY
                   How mysterious. A handsome young
                   man with 'important business' in
                   the still of night. Does it
                   involve a young lady?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   No.
                                 MILADY
                   Does it require clothes?
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.   I need my clothes.
                                 MILADY
                   They won't be ready for at least
                   an hour.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   An hour?
                                  MILADY
                   I told the  innkeeper to bring them
                   when they  are dry. Until then,
                   I'm afraid  you are my prisoner.
                   Would the  prisoner care for a
                   drink?

      Milady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. As
      she passes by the fire, her dressing gown seems to disap-
      pear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'Artagnan's
      heart stop.

                           never coy)
                   I am... thirsty.
      Milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him.      And
      offers a smile that dazzles and burns.

                                 MILADY
                   Good. Then we will sit by the
                   fire, and eat and drink, and you
                   may impress, perhaps even move me,
                   with the story of how you came to
                   lie unconscious, in the middle of
                   the night, on the road to Calais.
                          (soft seductively)
                   I love a good adventure.
      D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her.

108   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT                  108
      A CARRIER PIGEON FLUTTERS out of the dark sky, and enters
      its box. The little door on the other side opens. A
      hand reaches in and removes the bird. Richelieu unpeels
      the message on its leg.
                                                   CUT TO:


109   INT. CARDINAL'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT                       109
      A room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind
      Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the
      King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning
      d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and
      slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary
      opponent. Richelieu enters with the message.

                                 RICHELIEU
                          (dry; re: Rochefort's
                           fencing)
                   The wonderful thing about an
                   imaginary opponent is that he is
                   always greatly skilled, and always
                   easily defeated. The pride of
                   victory, without the risk of loss.
                   If only life were like that.

      Richelieu sits at his desk, peers at the message.      He
      looks up, pleased.

                   I told you not to worry about the
                   Musketeers. They are dead by now.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   Buckingham's signature will be on
                   the treaty by morning.

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   The King's birthday celebration...?
                                 RICHELIEU
                   Will proceed as planned. Thanks
                   to the kind intercession of Queen
                   Anne.
      Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   And our plans...?

                          (knowingly)
                   Will proceed as well.
      Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to
      Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the
      King's portrait. And drink.

110   INT. MILADY'S CHAMBER AT INN - NIGHT                      110

      D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front
      of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is
      empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains
      his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady
      speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:
                                  MILADY
                   You are sad.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I was thinking about my friends.
      Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She
      looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to
      continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All
      conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks
      quietly, from the heart:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   The three best friends a man could
                   have. We were separated on our
                   way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll
                   never see them again.

                                 MILADY
                   What brings you here?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'd like to tell you. But I can't.

                                 MILADY
                   'Important business.'

      D'Artagnan nods. He wants to impress her. He wants her
      to know how brave he is. And Milady is well aware of it.
      She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.
                                 MILADY
                   I understand. Men make bold plans
                   in secret. And women wait... to
                   mourn, or to celebrate the outcome.
                   I know from experience, it's a
                   lonely vigil.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN

                   All I can tell you is... I'm on a
                   mission for the King.
                                 MILADY
                          (looks up; laughs
                           lightly)
                   I've heard that one before.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm serious.
                                 MILADY
                   You are a young man. And young
                   men are given to exaggeration.
                   However, if you would like to
                   entertain me with a story, I'm
                   eager to hear it. And please,
                   make it very brave, filled with
                   handsome knights and beautiful
                   ladies. I know, a dragon --
      There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than
      a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts
      accordingly, and reveals:

                           d'Artagnan doesn't

                   A spy...?

                   Aren't you afraid?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Musketeers are not afraid of
                   anything.
                                 MILADY
                   I knew it. I knew you were a
                   Musketeer the moment I saw you.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   You did?

                                 MILADY
                   Of course.
                          (with sudden concern)
                   But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was
                   to find out you are here, your
                   life could be in grave danger.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   A Musketeer is not afriad of
                   danger.
                                 MILADY
                   I'm dangerous. You're not afraid
                   of me?
      Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the
      look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him.
      But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider.
      And midnight as it approaches.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   You're not dangerous.

                                 MILADY
                   Then what am I?

      Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists
      slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.

      Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along     the line of
      his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at      the top, enough
      for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they     press against
      the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her      finger traces.

                                 MILADY
                   Beauty, danger. They are the same.
      And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory
      comb...


111   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                  111
      He cannot continue.      Constance, the hour, a confusion he
      cannot deny.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm sorry --
      D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down
      toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a
      dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in
      the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking
      the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-
      stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger,
      stunned with fear and surprise:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What're you doing?! Have you lost
                   your mind?!

                                 MILADY
                   You came to Calais to stop a spy
                   from sailing to England.

      D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the
      messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to
      the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her
      negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,
      reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of
      the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess.
      Just as Athos told it to him.      Not so long ago.

                                  D'ARTAGNAN

                          (crying out)
                   Parker!!
      The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo-
      Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with
      a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And
      steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his
      right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-
      fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps
      forward to meet him.

      Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A
      series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.
      The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the
      martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,
      dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions.
      Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair,
      and commands:
                                MILADY
                   Kill him.
      Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward.        And
      d'Artagnan thinks fast.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   You can kill me. But a surprise
                   waits for you in England. That
                   even Buckingham can't prevent.
                                 MILADY
                          (stops Henri with
                           a gesture)
                   What... surprise?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   That's one thing I'll never tell
                   you.
                                 MILADY
                   D'Artagnan. You are young, vain,
                   and foolish. But I do not know
                   if you are clever.

      D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to
      suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping.
      Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes
      her mind.

                                 MILADY
                   We'll take him with us.

                   Parker will devise ways to
                   convince you to share your final
                   secret with me. It is a long
                   voyage.
      Milady's eyes show nothing but cold cruelty.

112   INT. INN - UPPER HALL AND LANDING - NEAR DAWN                112

      Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is
      followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by
      Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife
      against d'Artagnan's side.
                                 HENRI
                   The bodyguards are waiting outside.

      Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches
      the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws
      back with surprise.


113   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MILADY AND HER POV                          113
      The innkeeper, roused   from sleep, and wearing a night-
      shirt, is engaged in   urgent conversation with Armand de
      Winter -- the son of   the man Milady killed in Paris. The
      innkeeper shakes his   head. Armand grabs him by the
      collar.

      D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience,
      and just a hint of fear. Milady commands:
                                 MILADY
                   The back stairs. Hurry!
      They change directions. As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan
      catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below.

                                                      CUT TO:
114   EXT. INN - NIGHT                                             114

      Milady's coach emerges from the carriage house, speeds
      away in the direction of the harbor. In the driver's
      seat, Henri whips the horses, driving them onward.
      Milady's seven bodyguards follow on horseback.

                                                      CUT TO:

115   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                     115
      D'Artagnan and Parker  sit across from Milady. Her face
      betrays faint doubt,  apprehension. Emotions she is not
      used to feeling, let  alone displaying to the world around
      her. D'Artagnan sees   his opening... and speaks:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                The man at the inn... what did
                he want?
                              MILADY
                       (hollow laugh)
                Justice. Honor. Revenge.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Why?

                              MILADY
                He is the brother of my late
                husband, Lord de Winter. He
                blames me for de Winter's death.
                He thinks I murdered him.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Did you murder your husband,
                Milady?
                              MILADY
                What do you think?

      A beat. D'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face.
      Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I think he's not the first husband
                you killed.
                       (off her look)
                I once knew a man, one of the
                Counts of Berry. He told me a
                story... of beauty and danger.
                He was the bravest man I've ever
                known. And the saddest.

                              MILADY
                I know...

      The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But
      she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has
      reminded her of the one thing in the world that still
      touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady
      gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage
      window.

                                                   CUT TO:

116   EXT. CALAIS - NIGHT                                        116
      Milady's carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to
      the harbor. The fog is so thick that only the masts of
      the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom.
      Their lanterns glow gloomily. The carriage comes to a
      stop.

                                                   CUT TO:

117   EXT. HARBOR OF CALAIS - NIGHT                              117

      The lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog.
      We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier. Henri
      helps Milady out of the carriage. D'Artagnan follows.
      Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley
      bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier,
      ready for any encounter.
      D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.    There is a mel-
      ancholy air about him.
                              MILADY
                What's the matter, d'Artagnan?
                Still hoping for your friends to
                ride to the rescue?
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                My friends are dead.

                              MILADY
                Well. If it's any consolation,
                you'll soon be joining them.
      Milady's return to form does not surprise. Parker shoves
      d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship. A name can be
      made out on her barnacled hull. Persephone.

                                                   CUT TO:

118   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                          118

      Henri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an
      outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to
      the soupy darkness of her deck.

                              HENRI
                We are the Countess de Winter's
                party, arrived from Paris.
                Permission to come aboard.

      There is no reply.    Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan
      strains to see.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Permission granted.

      Milady nods to Henri. He steps up the narrow gangplank,
      followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six
      bodyguards.

                                                     CUT TO:

119   EXT. DECK OF THE PERSEPHONE - NIGHT                              119

      The deck is filled with swirling fog. Henri peers into
      the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others.
      He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing
      nearby.

                                 HENRI
                   Take us to your captain.
      The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move.        Henri
      demands:
                                 HENRI
                   What are you, deaf?
      Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the
      man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck.
      Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react.
                                   BODYGUARD
                   What is this?
      Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the
      other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure...
      are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The
      Bodyguards shout alarm and panic:

                                  BODYGUARDS
                   Dead!   They're all dead!

                                 PORTHOS (O.S.)
                   Well I certainly hope so. After
                   all that hard work.

      That's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down
      from above like avenging angels. They swing on the ends
      of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet
      first on top of Milady's Bodyguards. D'Artagnan stands
      open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords.

                                 ARAMIS
                          (calling to him)
                   You look like you've seen a ghost.

                   Two of them.

                                 PORTHOS
                   Remind me to tell you the story
                   of horses that could fly above
                   raging waters. A heroic tale of
                   love, death, and Musketeers.
                   Suitable for the general public.
      Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as
      he goes.
                                 PORTHOS
                   All right then. All those who
                   wish to die, raise your hands!
                   Don't by shy, there's plenty to
                   go around!
      D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join
      the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the
      Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords
      spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out
      of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on
      the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop
      d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted
      on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!
                                 ATHOS
                   Sorry I'm late. Did I miss
                   anything?
      D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.       He leaps to his
      feet and embraces Athos.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I thought you were dead.

                                 ATHOS
                   Keep your mind on the mission,
                   d'Artagnan.

      He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray. D'Artagnan
      follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards
      in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection.
      Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the
      absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --
      and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his
      opponents.

      Milady views the latter with alarm. As the battle rages
      around her, she retreats into the shadows.

      Athos and d'Artagnan find themselves fighting side by
      side. Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual
      frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown.
                                 ATHOS
                   Boy, it's a miracle you're still
                   alive fighting like that.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What do you mean?

                                 ATHOS
                   First, always find your enemy's
                   weakness. Second, take advantage
                   of it. Watch me.

      One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks
      Athos. Athos kicks the false leg out from under him,
      knocks him to the deck. D'Artagnan repeats, even as he
      disables his own foe.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Find the weakness. Take advantage.
                   Got it.
      Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last
      rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him
      where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,
      rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the
      ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis
      resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.

      Two SAILORS, crew members of the Persephone, return to
      the ship after a night's drunk. They see and hear the
      mayhem ahead.

                                 SAILOR
                   That's our ship...
      The two Sailors pull out daggers, and bound up the
      gangplank.

121   EXT. DECK OF PERSEPHONE - NIGHT                               121

      The two Sailors find themselves in the middle of a wild
      battle. They look around for someone to assault, see a
      large Musketeer with his back turned. They charge.

      Porthos hears them coming, spins. The two Sailors stop
      in their tracks, eyes popping with horrified recognition.

                                 BOTH SAILORS
                   Porthos the Pirate!!

      With a collective "yah!" the two Sailors drop their
      daggers, and flee into the foggy night. Porthos looks
      about to see if anyone noticed their exit. D'Artagnan
      grins nearby.

                                 PORTHOS
                   I told you I was famous.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Porthos the Pirate?

                                  PORTHOS
                   Privateer.   There's a difference.
      Every Musketeer is running from something or someone.
      D'Artagnan deadpans:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I love a good sea story.     Do tell
                   me sometime.
      Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest. But before he can
      reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray.

      PISTOLS EXPLODE.

      Athos drives several Bodyguards back with his sword,
      notices d'Artagnan working his way towards him.

                                 ATHOS
                   Did you find the Cardinal's spy?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.
                                 ATHOS
                   Did you kill him?

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Athos.   The spy... is a woman.

                   What?

      Athos turns to d'Artagnan, wonders. And at that moment,
      sees a figure at the gangplank, swathed in fog and diffuse
      light. Milady. Time stops as they regard each other
      across the deck, the battle between.

                                ATHOS
                   No.

      Milady turns and runs into the night.    Athos races after.
                                                      CUT TO:


124   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                             124
      With the speed and grace of a panther, Milady runs down
      the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of one of her
      Bodyguard's horses, and gallops off. Athos appears
      moments later, leaps into the saddle of another horse.
      And gives chase.

                                                      CUT TO:

125   EXT. HARBOR ROAD - NIGHT                                      125

      Milady whips her horse, drives it onward. But Athos
      overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms.
      They fall to the ground with a crash. Milady grabs the
      deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle.
      Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his
      side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half-
      light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.

      Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest.
      But Athos stands and shouts:
                                ATHOS
                   Stop!!
      Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him.
      Athos holds his musket in a steady hand. A very long
      beat. Milady takes a step closer. Finally, she whispers,
      with love, with hate:
                                MILADY
                   Athos.

                                 ATHOS
                   How did you do it, Sabine? How
                   did you come back from the dead?

                                 MILADY
                   A kind gentleman took pity on me.

                                 ATHOS
                   I did not.

                                 MILADY
                   No, Count. You were too proud to
                   listen to the truth. I learned
                   the value of lies soon after.

      Athos grips the pistol tighter, as if to ward off the
      past and what it brings.
                                 ATHOS
                   Give me the Cardinal's treaty.

                                 MILADY
                   No.
                                 ATHOS
                   Then I will shoot.
      Athos cocks the trigger.     Milady whispers:
                                  MILADY
                   Be kind.   And aim for my heart.
      Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull
      the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes
      his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly,
      before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past,
      their love, and where it led them.

                                 MILADY
                   I remember... everything.

      She turns and runs away... directly into the arms of
      Armand de Winter. He has ridden, and he has followed,
      and he has finally found her here.

                                 ARMAND
                   Countess de Winter...
      As d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis arrive on the scene...

      The public room is empty, save for d'Artagnan and the
      three Musketeers. They gather around a table. Aramis
      holds the treaty in his gloved hand. The mood is somber
      and tense.

                   The treaty outlines Richelieu's
                   plan to forge an alliance with
                   Buckingham.
                                 PORTHOS
                   What about the King?

                                 ARAMIS
                   He is not mentioned directly. But
                   the agreement is contingent on a
                   'demonstration' of the Cardinal's
                   power.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   A demonstration? What does that
                   mean?
                                   ARAMIS
                   I don't know.
      Athos' face grows dark. He has been silent throughout.
      Now he rises to his feet.

                                 ATHOS
                   I know someone who does.
      D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Porthos watch in grim silence as
      Athos crosses the room to an imposing door.

      A fire burns in the grate. Milady sits beside it in a
      chair, staring into the glowing embers. Their hot re-
      flection dances in her pale blue eyes. There is a KNOCK
      at the door. Armand de Winter emerges from a dark corner
      of the room where he has been standing guard with an
      impassive executioner. He crosses to the door, opens it.
      And Athos steps inside.
                                 ATHOS
                   I'd like a word with your
                   prisoner.

                          (a beat, he nods)
                   She dies at dawn.

      Athos nods, and steps to Milady, stands before her.
      Milady stares at the fire, speaks softly, her eyes on the
      flames.

                   No.

      Milady turns, looks up to face him.
                                 MILADY
                   There was a time when I would've
                   given my life for a kind word.
                                 ATHOS
                   I could not give it, Sabine.
                   I was... a fool.
      Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze.
      Athos indicates Armand in the corner.
                                 ATHOS
                   Did you kill his brother and his
                   father as he says?

                   you once thought me to be.
                                 ATHOS
                   But not before. Not us.
                                MILADY
                   No. The memory will keep me
                   company.
      Athos kneels at her side, near to pleading:

                                 ATHOS
                   Do you know the Cardinal's plans?

128   EXT. SEASIDE CLIFFS - NIGHT                                   128
      A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On
      the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined
      against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds,
      surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the
      cliff.
      Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift,
      her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years
      younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks
      behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis,
      d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step.

      The procession stops at the cliff's edge.
      THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The
      Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The
      Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his
      cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze.

      He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her
      image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until
      the day he dies.
      Aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred
      priestly cloth he carries.

                   I forgive you for your crimes.

                   Die in peace.

                   On your knees.
      Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau
      silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The
      Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck,
      exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the
      scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it
      down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:

                                   ATHOS
                   No.

      Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the
      scimitar loose. It falls to the ground.
                                 EXECUTIONER
                   What's this...?
      Porthos leaps forward, locks his great arms around Athos.

                                   PORTHOS
                   Athos --
      But Athos breaks free.       Milady rises to her feet.   Athos
      rushes to her.

                                 ATHOS
                   Forgive me, Sabine.       Please
                   forgive.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 MILADY
                   I do.

      The words he could never say, finally spoken. Milady
      locks eyes with him. Athos' desperate act, the pure
      feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release.
      And the strength to face her fate.

                                 MILADY
                   The Cardinal intends to assassinate
                   the King at his birthday celebration
                   on Friday.
      And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle
      kiss. Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned,
      uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the
      cliff's edge... and steps over it. The Executioner
      rushes to look after. The others follow. Except for
      Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the
      distant horizon. A long silence. THUNDER RUMBLES.
                                 EXECUTIONER
                   God's justice be done.

      D'Artagnan sadly lowers his head. Porthos puts a
      consoling hand on his shoulder. Aramis stands to the
      other side, mutters:
                                 ARAMIS
                   Amen.
                                 ATHOS
                   Musketeers.

      D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis turn. Athos has regained
      his former self. Stoic, in command. And hiding a broken
      heart.

                                 ATHOS
                   The King's life in danger.   We
                   have work to do.

      START CLOSE ON the now familiar portrait of King
      Louis XIII, usually found hanging behind Richelieu's
      desk. A SHOT RINGS OUT -- and a blast tears through
      the painting, leaving a smoking hole where the King's
      heart should be.

      REVEALS Richelieu and Rochefort as they walk across the
      roof to the painting, appraise the damage. Thie Cardinal
      pokes a long finger into the hole.
                               RICHELIEU
                 Impressive.

                               ROCHEFORT
                 He can do it every time.
      Rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman
      positioned far away on one of the roof parapets. The
      marksman rises from a shooter's crouch, bows curtly,
      and begins to reload his musket.

                               RICHELIEU
                 And he has no qualms about...
                               ROCHEFORT
                 None. He believes that man should
                 honor no Kings before God.
                               RICHELIEU
                 A man of faith. How delightful.
                        (turns back to
                         the painting)
                 Whatever you're paying him, double
                 it. I want the King's birthday to
                 be a memorable event. And rehang
                 this painting in my chamber. Just
                 as it is.
      HOLD ON Richelieu for a beat.   Framed by a sky filled
      with stars. His evil intent.

      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers thunder through on
      horseback. Pedestrians scurry to get out of their way.
      As they ride past, Porthos raises a crossbow and fires
      it. The arrow slices through the air with a terrible
      hum and imbeds itself on the public wall. Attached to
      the arrow is a piece of parchment, like the one in
      d'Artagnan's father's study. It reads: All For One,
      And One For All.

      pronouncement from horseback outside a cathedral.
      Townspeople are gathered around.

                declared outlaws and are sentenced
                to death. Any person sheltering
                or aiding them will be hanged --
      HOOFBEATS interrupt. The Captain turns in irritation.
      And Porthos and Aramis ride to either side, snatch the
      man up by the arms, drag him briefly through the air,
      and deposit him with a thud against a hitching post.
      The Captain, stunned, looks down at the piece of
      parchment now attached to his chest. All For One, And
      One For All.

      share a common destination, the Palace. A festive mood
      is in the air. And why not, it is the King's birthday.

137   INT. LOUVRE - GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY             137
      A gathering of nobles and ladies, all in full ceremonial
      dress. Rochefort is there as well, the familiar eye
      patch, in command of the Cardinal's Guards. A Seneschal
      waits at the door with two flanking lines of trumpeteers.
      The trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a royal
      blast.

      Louis, Queen Anne, and their retinue enter from a
      corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the
      balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside.
      Noblemen bow, and their ladies curtsy as the King and
      Queen pass. Constance, dressed for the occasion, looks
      on from the sidelines, smiles. The King and Queen
      proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet.

                              LOUIS
                They look... happy.

                Still, you were right about the
                celebration. And when the Cardinal
                told me how much it meant to you...

                I said nothing.

                              ANNE
                The Cardinal expressed in
                confidence how much the celebration
                would mean to you...
      Both pause to consider the manipulation.

      Richelieu stands in an anteroom just off the procession,
      he watches the King and Queen as they walk, speaks
      quietly, to himself:
                              RICHELIEU
                I'm not sure which is sadder... to
                die so young. Or to die a King.
      Richelieu turns from the procession. Speaks to Rochefort
      who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him.

                              RICHELIEU
                France will not go wanting. A new
                King will sit on the throne. The
                true King after all...

      He says it quiet fervor, the dream at long last within
      reach. Then, as if to reassure:

      The balcony has been colorfully decorated. The crowd
      focuses its attention on the empty space where the King
      will soon appear. Below, the entrance to the Palace is
      protected by a double line of the Cardinal's Guards,
      resplendent in their crimson tunics. It would take an

      The streets leading to the Palace are clogged with
      people, all pushing and straining to get closer.
      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers arrive on horseback,
      are forced to dismount. They push through the crowd,
      trying to reach the Palace, afraid that they will be too
      late. Athos barks orders as they struggle forward:

                          (to d'Artagnan)

      Athos and the others press on. D'Artagnan, a little
      disappointed to be left behind, pauses, checks the
      buildings that loom overhead. Then he starts, reacts
      with shock and surprise.

      The bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux monastery. A
      figure moving about, dimly-viewed, but this much is

      passing. They exchange significant smiles. Anne spots
      the smirk on Rochefort's face. He resumes a supplicant
      pose. Anne glances back, Richelieu behind them.

151   EXT. BELL TOWER - DAY                                     151

      The BIG BELL makes a resounding, ear-splitting CLANG --
      causing the marksman's SHOT to go wild.
                                                CUT TO:


152   EXT. LOUVRE - BALCONY - DAY                               152
      The SHOT misses the King and EXPLODES INTO the WALL an
      inch from his head. Louis turns to Richelieu -- sees
      anger and disappointment flash on the Cardinal's face.
      Just for an instant... but it is enough.
                                                CUT TO:

153   INT./EXT. LOUVRE - DAY                                    153
      Pandemonium, inside and outside the Palace. Athos,
      Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance,
      draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of
      Guards protecting the doors. The Guards cannot believe
      what they are seeing. Three men against a hundred. It's
      ridiculous. But then... the looks on Guards' faces begin
      to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.

154   THEIR POV                                                   154

      Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible
      happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some
      from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof-
      tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as
      monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold
      tunics.
      The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The
      corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and
      Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos
      keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are
      charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and
      face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in
      the sunlight.
                                ATHOS
                  Save the King!!

      The Musketeers charge.   It is a glorious sight.

      D'Artagnan scrambles up through the trapdoor, and tackles
      the marksman. As the BELL CONTINUES TO CLANG, they fight
      hand-to-hand. The marksman forces d'Artagnan toward the
      edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below.
      They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching
      d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him. And at
      the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of
      three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound-
      ing kick.

      The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor,
      and plunges to his death.
      D'Artagnan peers down the shaft. There's a faint CRASH
      as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes
      like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides
      down into the abyss.

156   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                     156
      Pandemonium reigns. Rochefort instructs his Guards to
      close the huge door to the great hall. The members of
      the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced
      the palace is under seige. Constance pauses amid the
      riot, seeks the Queen.

      But Richelieu has found her first. He steps to Anne,
      assumes an air of priestly innocence.
                              RICHELIEU
                Your Majesty...

      But Louis steps INTO VIEW, puts a protecting arm around
      his wife, speaks stern command:

                              LOUIS
                Leave us... alone.
      That's when a loud BOOM rocks the room.


157   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             157
      The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific
      blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into
      further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward,
      press their bodies against the door to secure it.
      BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half.
      Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic.
      His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis
      and Anne across the room.

                              RICHELIEU
                       (a cold whisper)
                Kill him. Kill her, too.

      Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath. He
      advances on Louis and Anne. Louis has witnessed the
      latter, treason confirmed. He raises his own sword,
      prepared to protect his Queen. To die for her if
      necessary.
                              LOUIS
                       (to Anne)
                Get behind me.
      Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King. But
      one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on
      the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other
      side. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead.

157   CONTINUED:                                                 157
      Louis breaks into a wide grin. The Musketeers wade into
      the Guards, and the great hall is transformed into a bat-
      tlefield. Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him.
                                 ATHOS
                   Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops.   Are
                   we interrupting?

                                   ROCHEFORT
                   Not for long.

      Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel.

158   BATTLE                                                     158

      Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack.
      But the young King has no intention of being protected.
      He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his
      Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions.
      Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her
      gaze, then returns to battle.
      Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard
      slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a
      heavy goblet, shouts:
                                   CONSTANCE
                   Look out!
      Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne
      catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the
      hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.

      Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him
      from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through.
      The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks,
      and continue.
      Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty
      confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand.
      Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's
      two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he
      staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the
      floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the
      treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off
      the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and
      Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded,
      Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.

      But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts.
      Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort
      grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But
      Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the
      face with his fist.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

158   CONTINUED:                                                    158
      Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides
      across the floor until someone's foot stops it.
      Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on
      the blade.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   This sword belongs to me.

      D'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He
      tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it
      neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows
      this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.
      But he shouts:
                                  ARAMIS
                   D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he
                   stands.
      These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the
      death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders. Rochefort
      confirms.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   By all means. Let's discover if
                   you are as brave a man as your
                   father was. And as foolish.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                          (stunned by the
                            revelation as it
                            unfolds)
                   What...?
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   He died for his King and for
                   France. But most of all... he
                   died on the end of my sword.
                          (the final curse)
                   As will you.
      Rochefort smiles a taunt.     D'Artagnan raises his sword,
      whispers to heaven.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   This is for you, Father.

      Then, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with
      everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining
      chamber.


159   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHAMBER                                     159
      A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth. Its light pro-
      jects giant shadows on the wall as d'Artagnan and
      Rochefort duel, slashing at each other.

                                                             132.

160   GREAT HALL                                                    160
      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take the fight to the
      Cardinal's Guards. Each with his by-now familiar
      tradmarks. King Louis fighting beside them.

161   D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT                                     161

      They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their
      faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan
      has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.
      Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He
      cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a
      knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the
      floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But
      d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his
      feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.

      Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.
      He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with
      superior disdain:
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   One thing's certain. You're no
                   Musketeer.
      But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. "Always find
      your enemy's weakness." He shoves a thumb into
      Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward.
      D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's
      heart.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Take it back...?

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   I might... have been... mistaken.

      Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks
      at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death
      finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a
      SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling
      at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his
      doublet.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   No!!

      Richelieu smiles,   hurls the treaty into the blazing
      fireplace. As the    flames begin to lick at the parchment
      paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives
      after to retrieve   it.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan
      stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,
      clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d'Artagnan's look
      of triumph...
                                                    CUT TO:


162   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                       162
      A short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers
      have won. On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu
      who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers.
      Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands.

      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   Your Majesty, that document is an
                   obvious forgery. I am clearly the
                   victim of a conspiracy designed
                   and perpetuated by these three
                   Musketeers.

      Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to
      both King and Queen.
                                 LOUIS
                   This is a complicated matter,
                   Your Eminence, affecting both
                   France and the crown...
      A beat. As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude
      blame after all. But Louis continues with quiet author-
      ity, just a trace of humor. As King, and as a man.
                                 LOUIS
                   And so, until such time as I and
                   my advisors --
                          (gestures toward
                           Anne; the
                           Musketeers)
                   -- can determine the whole truth
                   of the matter. I invite you to
                   await our decision in the comfort
                   of... the Bastille.

      Musketeers close in around the Cardinal.     He fumes,
      protests.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   You can't do this to me.   I'm the
                   Cardinal of France.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

162   CONTINUED:                                                         162
                                 LOUIS
                          (never more certain)
                   And I am its King.
      Shouts of "Long live the King!       Long live the King!"

                                 LOUIS
                   And as King... I hereby reinstate
                   the Musketeers.
      A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led
      from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan.
                                 RICHELIEU
                   Congratulations, Monsieur
                   d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an
                   eye on you.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (unphased)
                   Thank you, Your Eminence.    I'll
                   be watching you, too.
      Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by
      guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind
      his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him.
      Louis turns to the Musketeers.       He indicates d'Artagnan.

                                 LOUIS
                   Is this the young man who saved
                   my life?
      Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.
                                 PORTHOS
                   His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.

                                 LOUIS
                   Approach, d'Artagnan.

      D'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and
      Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And
      turns to the Queen.

                   I have something that belongs to
                   ... Your Majesty...
      D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country
      road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the
      Queen smiles.

                                 ANNE
                   Thank you, d'Artagnan. But the
                   bracelet does not belong to me.
                          (off his look)
                   It belongs to her.

      Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW.
      D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time.
      The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance,
      charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around
      her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis
      continues:
                                 LOUIS
                   D'Artagnan, I am in your debt.
                   What can I do to repay the courage
                   you've shown me? Anything,
                   D'Artagnan.  Whatever your heart
                   desires...
      D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied,
      unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him.
                                 ATHOS
                   Majesty, his heart has only one
                   desire. To become a Musketeer.
      D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession.
      Louis answers with pleasure.
                                 LOUIS
                   Then kneel, d'Artagnan.
      D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of
      his sword on each of his shoulders.
                                 LOUIS
                   The world is an uncertain realm,
                   filled with danger. Truth
                   despoiled by broken promises.
                   Honor undermined by the pursuit
                   of gold. Freedom sacrificed when
                   the weak are oppressed by the
                   strong. But there are those who
                   oppose these powerful forces.
                   Those who dedicate their lives to
                   truth, honor, and freedom. They
                   are a constant reminder to all of
                   us. That such a life is not just
                   possible, but necessary to our
                   continued survival. As a country,
                   as a King. These men are known as
                   the Musketeers...

      As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless
      images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony,
      Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first
      encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their
      adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a
      busy week.

                                 LOUIS
                   Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them.
                   Musketeer.

      D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS
      RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears
      gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround
      their young friend, and happily present him with the
      bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic
      over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan
      hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts
      more valuable than gold.
      Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.       Who, to the surprise
      of all who know him... smiles.
                                 PORTHOS
                   Do my eyes deceive me?
                                 ARAMIS
                   I find it hard to believe myself.

                                 PORTHOS
                   His lips, unused as they are to
                   such a contortion, twisted and
                   stretched... into a smile.

                                 ARAMIS
                   It was spectacular. And what
                   teeth.

      D'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I know this is a stupid question.
                   But what exactly does a Musketeer
                   do?

      Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance.       They're not so
      sure themselves.
                                 PORTHOS
                   Truth... honor...

                                 ARAMIS

                    Peter Hewitt, William Osborne & Michael McCullers 

               
               
               
               
               
               Animated scenes of the Thunderbirds on various rescues begin 
               to play as some of the cast and crew names show up.

               
                             NARRATOR
               From a secret island in the South Pacific, 
               the courageous Tracy family run an organization               
               called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere 
               in the world, they are always first on the
               scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, 
               the Thunderbirds.

               (Counts down numbers and shows corresponding
               Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go!
 
               
               Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window.
 
               
               
               But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.
 
               
               
               
                             TEACHER
               So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus 
               B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what 
               happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E,
               F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window
               and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy!

               
                             FERMAT
               Alan. Alan!

               
               Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who 
               is now standing in front of him.
 
               
                             TEACHER
               How kind of you to come back from outer 
               space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't 
               too rough?
 
               (Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) 
               Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean
               theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in?
 
               
                             ALAN TRACY
               I was just...

               
                             TEACHER
               Apparently not (she picks up his notebook 
               which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds 
               are go."

               Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring 
               break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk
               the day you get back. That should keep you busy.
 
               
               Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk 
               out to their lockers.
 
               
                             ALAN
               (mocking the teacher) "That should keep 
               you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 
               10,000 words 
               and stick them right up your..."

               
                             FERMAT
               Alan!

               
               Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them 
               while walking by with the teacher from before

               
                             ALAN
               Headmaster.

               
                             HEADMASTER
               Mr. Tracy!

               
                             ALAN
               Miss Garrett.

                             FERMAT
               You gotta be more careful Alan.

                             ALAN
               Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird 
               Fermat?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds 
               yet. And if your identity was discovered, 
               it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.

               
                             ALAN
               I know, I know.

               We are told this super-rig is now in 
               danger of total collapse.

               And there is real concern for the lives of six 
               men who remain trapped on board.

               An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes 
               ago. They should be here any moment now.

               (pauses and points at the sky while exclaiming excitedly) 
               And here they are!

               That is good news, milady.

               Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?

               So I'm getting the reading telling me 
               that the wind is blowing 60 knots, right 
               up my keister.
 
               
                             VIRGIL
               No kidding.

               
                             ALAN
               Did you try readjust the flaps?

               
                             SCOTT
               Well that's the first thing I did, Sprout! 
               It's not my first day in a Thunderbird 
               you know.

                             VIRGIL
               Yeah and don't you have homework to 
               do or something?
 
               
                             GORDON
               Unless he's blown up this school, like 
               the last one!

               Yeah, keep Alan away from the ships, 
               he's a hazard.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Okay, that's enough. Pass the salad.

               Man, I haven't seen that much fire since 
               that volcano in Fiji.
 
               
                             SCOTT
               That wasn't Fiji that was Istanbul.
 
               
                             VIRGIL
               No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake.
 
               
                             SCOTT
               Yeah well, nothing compares to Argentina.

               Fermat. Let's go.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               But! I'm not done! (sighs) Okay.

               Of course.

               I'll be right there. It seems the fire 
               at the oil rig was no accident.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Any suspects?

               My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.

               (makes an annoyed face) Alan's back? 
               (changes her tone to a more pleasant

               Alan's back! (looks at Kyrano) Hey, Dad.

               When are those two going to get along?
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE

               thing.

               
                             JEFF
               What sort of thing?

               Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one

               silo door. Fermat is running his hand
 
               on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1.

               1 earlier.
 
               
                             FERMAT

               Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't

               give me a minute to
 
               explain- (Jeff cuts him off)

               under control.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Under control? Do you have any idea 
               of the importance of secrecy in our 
               operation? You fired up
 
               a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You 
               put everyone in danger when you act
 
               selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play 
               by the rules. You understand? (Alan just
 
               looks at him) Do you?

               
                             ALAN
               Yeah, I understand. I understand you 
               don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You 
               don't want me to
 
               do anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell 
               you something important!
 
               
                             JEFF

               Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow 
               up.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Then let me. (he stalks toward the door

               30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything

               Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, 
               a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's

                             JOHN
               Well, we've all been there. And Dad, 
               you've done a great job since Mom died.
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon 
               for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, 
               see if they need
 
               help with that fire.

               Hey, son. There's something I'd like 
               to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               The neural-net control system?

               
                             BRAINS
               It's great to have you back. I bet you

               Brains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone 
               in front of him. It also lifts up the Mole

               The neural-net control system short circuits.

               There's something I want to talk to 
               you about.
 
               
                             BRAINS
               Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having 
               problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort 
               of gallium compound on the nosecone 
               of Thunderbird
 
               1.

               We should check that out st-st-st-immediately.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               That'd be g-g-g-swell!

               Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach. The camera 
               follows one rock and it leads to a
 
               telescope coming out of the water. The telescope is connected 
               to the Hood's submarine.

                             TRANSOM
               Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has 
               evaded their detection
 
               systems. We have a positive visual from the tracking solution

               Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target

                             THE HOOD
               Why would I want to destroy what will 
               soon be mine? One of the principle tenets 
               of Eastern
 
               martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him.
 
               
               
               The Hood uses his powers to keep Mullion in place

               It will be almost impossible to force 
               the Thunderbirds to leave their island. 
               On the other
 
               hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go.

               
               The Hood stops using his powers on Mullion and Mullion falls 
               over.
 
               
                             THE HOOD

               All we need do is give them the victim.

               Scene switches to John on Thunderbird 5 when suddenly alarms 
               start to go off around him.

               Missile hits Thunderbird 5 and John is blow back into a wall 
               from the explosion. The scene then
 
               switches over to Tracy Island.

               Scene switches back to Command and Control room.

               
                             TRANSOM
               Professor Hackenbacker? We met at last 
               year's international conference on
 
               
               nanotechnology. I thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely, 
               stimulating.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Transom, concentrate!

               
                             TRANSOM
               Sorry, sir. The command control switch, 
               is here. Fingerprint recognition system.
 
               
               
                             THE HOOD
               Professor. Please. Activate the control 
               switch.
 
               
                             BRAINS
               N-n-n-n-n- You must be kidding.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Professor, you and I share an interest 
               in the science of the mind. The difference 
               is, I was
 
               born with my powers. Trust me when I tell you, you've barely 
               touched the surface. (Brains is forced to
 
               stand up and walked over to the Hood) Even the strongest minds 
               can be broken. It would be a pity to
 
               break yours.

               
                             BRAINS
               Fu-Fu-Fu- No way!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Activate the control switch, Prof! (Uses 
               his powers to make BRAINS move) Like 
               a puppet on
 
               a string! (laughs)

               
               Brains hand touches the activation pad.

               
               
                             TRANSOM
               We have control.

               
                             MULLION
               (To Brains) Get up.

               
                             TRANSOM
               Sorry, Professor. Nothing personal.
 
               
               
               Scene briefly switches to the children's worried faces in the 
               vents. Scene then changes back to
 
               Thunderbird 5, where the control panel is buzzing.

               
                             SCOTT
               We got a warning light on our EPS system.

                             SCOTT
               No, that's negative!

               
               Scene switches back to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat in the vents.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               That's it.

               
                             FERMAT
               Okay, this one.

               
               Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.

               
                             JEFF
               Back to Thunderbird 3 now. (turns to 
               help an injured John) John, we gotta 
               move.
 
               
                             GORDON
               The locking mechanism's jammed!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Attention, Thunderbird 5. As you can 
               see I have taken over your facilities. 
               You no longer
 
               control your operational systems.

               
               Scene change back to the kids in the vent. They can stick their 
               heads out of the vent and see into the
 
               Command and Control Room, but they are hidden behind a panel 
               and the Hood and his minions
 
               cannot see them.

               
                             ALAN
               They've taken over.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Warm them up, Transom.

               
                             TRANSOM
               Increasing temperature to maximum.
 
               
               
               The children are now looking into the Command and Control room. 
               Kyrano and his wife, Onaha, are
 
               dragged in.

               
                             ALAN
               Who's the bald freak?

               
                             KYRANO
               You? The Hood uses his powers on him 
               and he falls down clutching his head.
 
               
               
                             TINTIN

               They've got m-my dad.

               
                             JEFF
               Okay, you have our attention. Who are 
               you? What do you want?
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Oh how rude of me. You can call me The 
               Hood. Now, listen, Mr. Tracy. We won't 
               be
 
               negotiating. I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest 
               banks in the world, starting with the
 
               Bank of London. The world's monetary system will be thrown into 
               chaos and the Thunderbirds held
 
               responsible.

                             SCOTT
               You'll never get away with it.

               
                             JEFF
               Why the Thunderbirds?

               
                             THE HOOD
               An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy.

               
                             JEFF
               An eye for an eye?

               
                             THE HOOD
               Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely 
               you remember saving the life of my brother,
 
               
               Kyrano?

               
                             KYRANO
               Turns to the video phone that the Hood 
               has been using to communicate with Thunderbird 
               5.
 
               I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. I thought he was dead.

               
                             THE HOOD
               (Laughs and then turns to the guards)Take 
               them away.
 
               
                             MULLION
               Yes, sir.

               
               The kids lift their heads back up into the vents

               
                             ALAN
               Whoa.

               
                             TINTIN
               That makes The Hood my uncle?

               Every family has a black sh-sh- a black 
               sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command 
               and
 
               Control room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was 
               him that sneezed.)
 
               
                             FERMAT
               (Turns to look at Alan) This room's 
               murder with my allergies.
 
               
               The kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what 
               is going on in the Command and Control
 
               room.

               
                             THE HOOD
               You left me to die that day. You may 
               have broken my body but you've no idea 
               how
 
               powerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered, 
               waiting for a rescue that will
 
               never come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with 
               Thunderbird 5.)

               Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then 
               the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott, 
               status report.

               Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to 
               the emergency batteries. Clean the air.

                             JOHN
               About four hours.

               
               Scene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and 
               Control room. Fermat begins to start
 
               sneezing again. Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose 
               and mouth to try and muffle the sound.)
 
                             MULLION
               Someone's there. (Mullion walks over 
               to the ceiling, he is standing directly 
               below where
 
               they are. The kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand 
               shoots up through the ceiling and grabs
 
               Alan's ankle. He lets go after Tintin bites his hand and he gasps 
               in pain.)
 
               
               The children are now talking loudly and everyone in the Command 
               and Control room can hear them.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Run! Run!

               No, jump! We can get through to the 
               silos.
 
               
               The children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the 
               silos. And the scene switches to the
 
               Command and Control room.

               
                             THE HOOD

               Go! Go!

               
               The children reach the door that leads to Thunderbird 3's silo 
               just as it closes.
 
               
                             ALAN
               This way. (They run toward the still 
               closing Thunderbird 1 silo door.)

               Alan! This equipment is only to be used 
               in an emergency. (Alan and Tintin give 
               him looks) I
 
               guess this qualifies.

                             TINTIN
               Let's move it.

               
                             ALAN
               That's it. Time to thunderize. (After 
               the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes!
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Come on, let's go!

               
                             MULLION
               Get 'em!

               
                             ALAN
               Where's Fermat?

               
                             TINTIN
               Fermat!

               
                             ALAN
               Fermat!

               
                             FERMAT
               Coming!

               
                             ALAN
               Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird 
               1's silo) What were you doing back there,
 
               
               Fermat?

               
                             FERMAT
               I had an-n-n idea.

               
                             ALAN
               Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open 
               the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan 
               types in a pass
 
               code)

               
                             ALAN
               (To Tintin and Fermat) Go back. Yell 
               when you see them coming. (tries another 
               pass code)
 
               
               Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can 
               see The Hood on the other side of
 
               the door. Alan turns back and sees him.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Alan. You can run if you want. Were 
               you surprised to hear what your father 
               did to me? It is
 
               frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps 
               you already suspected that about
 
               your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do 
               you suppose it was guilt? Because he
 
               let your mother die. (Alan shakes his head no) Open the door, 
               Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head
 
               no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries 
               to use his powers on Alan but nothing
 
               happens)

               
                             ALAN
               (Shouting to Tintin and Fermat) We can't 
               go this way. He's there.
 
               
               The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the 
               other guards appear at the other
 
               doorway, leaving the children trapped.

               
                             FERMAT
               No! (he falls slightly) Ow. What are 
               we gonna do, Alan?
 
               
                             ALAN
               I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? (Alan 
               looks at the control panel behind the 
               Hood and sees a
 
               button that will open part of the floor under Thunderbird 1. 
               Keep backing up. I've got an idea. (Alan
 
               takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of 
               his pants. and fires it at the button, but
 
               misses.)

               
                             TINTIN
               That's your idea?

               
                             THE HOOD
               It's not me you're angry at, Alan.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               It's not you I'm aiming at. (Alan fires 
               another rock and this time hits the 
               button and the floor
 
               drops out from underneath Tintin, Fermat, and Alan. Tintin, Fermat, 
               and Alan scream as they fall.)
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Get them!

               
                             MULLION
               Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And 
               set it on broil!
 
               
               The kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel 
               and see the flames coming from
 
               Thunderbird 1 behind them. Tintin screams even louder. The tunnel 
               opens up and leads to the ocean.
 
               
               Back in Command and Control

               
                             TRANSOM
               No sign of them.

               
                             MULLION
               Of course not, the little brats went 
               up like firecrackers. Pop, pop, pop! 
               (laughs at Brains and
 
               Brains moves to punch him.)

               
                             THE HOOD
               Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor. 
               This is taking too long. Pick out the 
               equipment
 
               you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 
               2. No more delays.
 
               
                             MULLION
               Yes, sir.

               Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach, 
               they are getting knocked over by a couple
 
               of waves. Fermat is coughing and spluttering.

               
                             FERMAT
               How about a little warning next time 
               you pull a stunt like that?
 
               
                             ALAN
               Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               I could have drowned.

               
                             ALAN
               You mean you can't swim?!

               
                             FERMAT
               I repeat, I could have drowned.

               
               Scene switches to the boys ringing out their shirts, they are 
               both in their boxers.
 
               
                             ALAN
               I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put 
               this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch 
               each other's backs.
 
               Nice drawers.

               
                             FERMAT
               Thank you.

               
                             TINTIN
               Boo!

               
                             ALAN
               No, c'mon Tintin, stay there.

               
                             TINTIN
               You're worse than a couple of girls. 
               Hurry up and get dressed. (To Fermat) 
               Those are nice
 
               drawers!

               
               Scene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 
               5 via satellite, right?
 
               
                             ALAN
               Right.

               
                             FERMAT
               So, there's a miniscule possibility 
               that if we reach the satellite station, 
               we could
 
               
                             ALAN
               Blow it up!

               
                             FERMAT
               No, we could hack in to it and give 
               control back to Thunderbird 5.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's 
               do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan 
               in the sand) Here's the
 
               plan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the 
               base of the mountain to the access road,
 
               here. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think?
 
               
               
                             TINTIN
               Good. Except that we're here, not there, 
               and the transmitter is there, not here. 
               We have to go
 
               through the jungle.

               
                             FERMAT
               But that's f-f- off limits.

                             TINTIN
               It's gonna be dangerous.

               
                             ALAN
               I'm in. (All three of them put their 
               hands together) We gotta get up there 
               fast! All our folks are
 
               in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island

               
                             FERMAT
               Actually, he's not going anywhere for 
               now.
 
               
                             ALAN
               The guidance processor for Thunderbird 
               2. You can't take off without it. Fermat 
               you're a genius.
 
               How'd you get this?

               
                             FERMAT
               Alan, my friend, what you don't know, 
               can't hurt you.
 
               
               Scene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England, 
               where Parker is out cleaning a car
 
               when the car phone rings.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Parker?

               
                             PARKER
               Milady?

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               We have an emergency.

               
               Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               What a charming fellow.

               
               Someone knocks on the door.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Come in.

               
               Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is 
               up to her shoulders in bubble bath.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Have a look at this, Parker. (There 
               is a computer monitor near her feet.) 
               He, and this
 
               woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.
 
               
               
                             PARKER
               Sounds like an alias, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh 
               Belagant. Assumed dead when
 
               
               his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya. 
               (takes a sip of tea) Oh, perfect, Parker.
 
               The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr. 
               Belagant's brother.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, 
               Kyrano.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               How's my schedule, Parker?

               
                             PARKER
               You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord 
               Marlborough, a benefit gala for the 
               Institute of the
 
               Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               I suppose that's urgent.

               
                             PARKER
               Yes, milady. There was also a bridge 
               collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic 
               eruption in
 
               Jakarta.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               The Thunderbirds haven't responded?
 
               
               
                             PARKER
               No, milady. And the media is awash in 
               speculation vis-à-vis their whereabouts. 
               Parker turns on
 
               the news.

               
                             CHUCK
               Over to Lisa Lowe.

               
                             LISA LOWE
               Chuck, disaster after disaster around 
               the world today and still no sight of 
               the Thunderbirds.
 
               Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands 
               have been left homeless by a
 
               volcano in Jakarta. Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible 
               machines
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               I think it's time to send the emergency

               Parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins 
               to blink and beep. Back on Tracy
 
               Island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but Brains is 
               unable to get up to get to it because he is
 
               tied up.

               I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like 
               The Hood was inside my head back there.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               What do you mean, Alan?

               
                             ALAN
               Maybe he can read minds or control minds 
               or something.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can 
               be explained by science.
 
               
                             ALAN
               I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. 
               Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles 
               heel. It's got a blister the size of 
               a basketball. Tintin!
 
               Can we s-s-

               
                             TINTIN
               Stop?

               
                             FERMAT
               Yes!

               
                             TINTIN
               No!

               Nothing, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough 
               that I've broken my shooting arm. We
 
               
               shall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And 
               bring the car around.

               Yes, milady.

               The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot 
               of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's 
               go,
 
               Parker.

               
               They get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island.

               Ready for launch. We'll use this to

                             THE HOOD
               Subtle, as usual, Mullion.

               
                             MULLION
               I didn't realize we'd be getting points 
               for style. We're robbing banks, remember.
 
               
               
               The Hood uses his power on Mullion and Mullion gasps.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Don't worry. You'll get your money.

               An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2.

               
                             MULLION
               What's going on?

               
               
                             TRANSOM
               It's the guidance processor.

               
                             MULLION
               What's wrong with it?

               
                             TRANSOM
               There isn't one.

               
                             MULLION
               Aaargh!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Clever Alan. It's the children. They 
               have it.
 
                             MULLION
               No way. They're dead. No one could live 
               through something like that.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever 
               you need. And make sure you get the 
               guidance
 
               processor before you lose your temper.

               Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Blossoming?! What's that supposed to 
               mean?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Come on, Alan. You've a c-crush on her.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's. 
               She's not that bad, I guess.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               (Reaches the top of the mountain) Okay, 
               guys, take five.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               (Still finishing climbing up the mountain)Five 
               isn't going to do it!
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Guys?

               
               Alan and Fermat reach the top of the mountain, they are both 
               puffing and panting. Tintin smiles at
 
               them before she sees a scorpion on Alan's shoulder.

               
                             TINTIN
               Don't move.

               
                             FERMAT
               (Sees scorpion when he stands up next 
               to Alan) Whoa
 
               
                             ALAN
               What is it?

               
                             TINTIN
               Hexdrotilous scorpion.

               
                             ALAN
               Is that dangerous?

               
                             FERMAT
               .025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.
 
               
               
               Tintin uses powers just like her uncle, The Hood, to lift the 
               scorpion off of Alan's shoulder and lets it
 
               fall to the ground.

               
                             FERMAT
               Watch out!

               
                             ALAN
               Tintin, what was that?

               
                             TINTIN
               Let's get going.

                             ALAN
               Hey! She has the same powers as her 
               uncle, The Hood.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               You think?

               
                             ALAN
               Must run in the family. Did you do that?
 
               
               
                             TINTIN
               Just drop it, okay?

               
                             ALAN

               an explosion near Scott and Gordon.

               We're okay.

               
                             SCOTT
               The heat exchanger has blown.

                             FERMAT
               Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate 
               equipment. (The circuit board sparks.) 
               Which is
 
               now b-b-broken.

               
                             ALAN
               Can you fix it?

               
                             FERMAT
               Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something 
               to solder with.
 
               
                             ALAN
               We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, 
               where are you going to find something 
               like that. (Tintin
 
               and Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What?

               
               Alan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's 
               retainer.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Ow!

               
                             FERMAT
               Perfect.

               
                             TINTIN
               Gee Alan, I never figured you for a 
               crybaby.
 
                             ALAN
               I'm gonna kill you.

               
                             FERMAT
               What'd he say?

               
                             TINTIN
               I think it was some sort of apology.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! 
               Okay, first step is to establish contact 
               with Thunderbird

               were starting to sizzle.
 
               
               
                             TRANSOM
               (To the Hood as he walks in) A burst

                             THE HOOD
               And give Mullion the coordinates.

               
               Scene switches to Mullion and the two guards in a car. Transom 
               is communicating with him through
 
               his headset.

               Hang in there Dad, one more minute,

                             FERMAT
               It's not going to work Alan. The signal's 
               too weak for data transmission.

               That's a negative! It's too dangerous.

               Lady Penelope at the

               I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all 
               of us.
 
               
                             ALAN

               You don't have to be such a tough guy 
               Alan. I'm worried about my dad too.

               Even worse, they know exactly

               
               Tires screech and Mullion and the guards appear.

               
                             FERMAT
               Where we are!

               Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the 
               hillside for a second.
 
               
                             MULLION
               Come on!

               
               The kids fall down a ditch screaming and into a river.

               
                             FERMAT
               Great, more water.

               
                             ALAN
               Tintin, can you slow 'em down?

               
                             TINTIN
               I'd be delighted.

               
                             ALAN
               Then do it. And meet us at the junk 
               yard. Come on, Fermat.
 
               
               Scene changes to Alan and Fermat discovering a hoversled in the 
               junkyard.
 
               
                             ALAN
               This'll get us out of here.

               
               Scene change to Mullion hunting Tintin down in the forest.

               
                             MULLION
               There! Come on!

               
               Tintin looks up and sees a bees hive.

               
                             MULLION
               Straight ahead.

               
               Tintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other 
               two guards. Mullion falls off the car
 
               and into a puddle while being stung by bees. The scene cuts back 
               to Alan and Fermat in the junkyard
 
               attaching something to the back of the hoversled so that all 
               three of them can fit on it.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               It's gonna make this thing hard to control 
               you know.

               four bars of boost or else
 
               
                             ALAN
               I said no problem.

               Guys, let's go we've got to get out 
               of here. What is this?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               It's a hoversled.

               
                             ALAN
               It's our ticket out, unless you've got 
               a better idea.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, 
               like your dad said.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               (Hands Tintin the seat to the hoversled) 
               Here.
 
                             ALAN
               Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get 
               caught. I say we do something. Now! 
               Right, Fermat?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't 
               think this is s-s-safe.
 
               
                             ALAN
               You don't think anything is s s-safe.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean 
               that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we 
               should make
 
               decisions as a team.

               that hideous hammock.

                             THE HOOD
               (After seeing Lady Penelope and Parker) 
               Whom do we have here? Mullion.
 
               
                             MULLION
               I must warn you that I know judo, krai 
               magna, and tae kwon do.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               And I know Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Milady.

               
                             MULLION
               (After Parker punches him in the face) 
               You've broken my nose.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Yes, that was very much the intention 
               of the maneuver.
 
               
                             TRANSOM
               (After she tries to attack Lady Penelope 
               and Lady Penelope pushes her over) Whoa!
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               One tries so hard in life to sort things 
               out on an intellectual-slash-conversational 
               level.
 
               sometimes it's just not possible.

               
               Lady Penelope continues to fight Transom and Parker continues 
               to fight Mullion, the Hood is watching
 
               them.

               
                             PARKER
               (after Mullion threw him against a metal 
               cabinet) Shall I bring the car around, 
               milady?
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.

               
                             PARKER
               (Sees Mullion behind Lady Penelope) 
               Excuse me, milady. (punches him and 
               after that has no
 
               effect he picks up a frying pan and hits Mullion)

               
               Transom goes back to fighting Lady Penelope and Mullion is fighting 
               Parker.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Ah, Lady Penelope! Of course he has 
               his palace. Why not his princess?
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Flattery will get you nowhere. (after 
               she blocks the metal bar that Transom 
               was trying
 
               to hit her with) Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs 
               these days?
 
               
                             PARKER
               (Is pushing Mullion forward) Coming 
               through, milady.
 
               
               The camera quickly pans a little bit outside to show Alan hidden 
               behind some shrubs watching the
 
               fight.

               
                             PARKER
               (After the Hood uses his powers to throw 
               a sofa at them) Duck, milady!
 
               
                             ALAN
               He's weak. Using his power makes him 
               weak. (The Hood, having heard something 
               looks over
 
               toward where Alan)

               
                             THE HOOD
               You're formidable opponent Lady Penelope. 
               More than a match for most men.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               That's not saying much, then, is it?
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               (uses his powers to stop the punch that 
               Parker was about to throw at him) I 
               suggest you
 
               let us pass.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Don't try your parlor games on me you 
               sad, little man. You've committed a 
               serious
 
               crime trespassing on this island. And in about (looks at Parker's 
               watch) four seconds, I'm going to get
 
               quite cross with you. (the Hood uses his powers to stop her foot 
               which was about to come up and kick
 
               him.)

               
                             THE HOOD
               (with his back still to Alan) How are 
               you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker 
               and Lady
 
               Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into 
               the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm
 
               going to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope 
               and they cry out in pain again)
 
               You can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out 
               again) You have something that belongs
 
               to me.

               
                             PARKER
               Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't 
               the first time my head's been pulverized. 
               And it's never
 
               done any real harm before. (The Hood once again uses his powers 
               on them and they cry out in pain
 
               louder this time)

               
                             ALAN
               (comes out of his hiding place) Stop! 
               Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the 
               guidance processor
 
               toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it 
               over to him before it can hit the water)
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give 
               you that. (to Mullion and Transom) Put 
               them with the
 
               others. (Transom grabs Parker)

               
                             MULLION
               (To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming 
               with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws 
               Lady
 
               Penelope over his shoulder)

               (To Mullion) Big oaf! (The fridge door 
               closes leaving them trapped) Right, 
               that's quite
 
               enough losing for one day.

               I'm so sorry, Fermat.

               Thank you, milady. Unfortunately, I

               access the mechanism.

               Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu 
               landing,
 
               causing total panic in Central London. As far as we know there

               area so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at 
               all. I don't know if you can see this Chuck

               Hey, Dad. That stuff The Hood said,

               motions for the kids to run forward 
               but Transom
 
               blocks them. Parker puts his hands up as if to punch her)

               Go on, then.

               
                             PARKER
               No, sorry. I can't hit a lady.

               
                             TINTIN
               Allow me. (she kick Transom and runs 
               off, Transom chases her)

                             PARKER
               And I've been waiting to get my hands 
               on you.
 
               
               They brawl for a few seconds before Mullion lands a good punch 
               on Parker.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Ow, now that was a punch.

               
                             FERMAT
               Parker, can we wrap this up?

               Strategically speaking, the best odds

               The Hood looks dazed but then uses his powers to fly up to the 
               catwalk above the Mole. The scene
 
               then switches to Tintin being chased by Transom running into 
               a cage.
 
               
                             TRANSOM
               Come here, you little minx! (Tintin 
               jumps up on a bar and flips to the other 
               side while
 
               Transom runs into the wall) Ow!

               
                             TINTIN
               (Closing the cage door) Bye-bye.

               
               Scene switches back to the room with The Hood, Alan, Jeff, and 
               Lady Penelope.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Alan, stay back.

                             THE HOOD
               You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's 
               footsteps. (uses his powers to lift 
               Alan off the
 
               floor and makes him start choking himself with his own hands)
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Let him go.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Did you really think you could challenge 
               me?
 
               
                             JEFF
               Let him go, please.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Let him go.

               
                             JEFF
               Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens 
               his hold of Alan and then releases him)
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Alan! Are you all right?

               
                             JEFF
               Alan, get out. Run!

               
                             ALAN
               He's getting weaker. He can't last much 
               longer.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb 
               up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, 
               no! Look out! (The
 
               Hood starts the Mole with his powers and Alan has to jump and 
               grab the railing of the catwalk) Alan!
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               I'm glad you could be here to see this, 
               Jeff. (steps on one of Alan's hands 
               until he cries in
 
               pain and lets go)

               
                             THE HOOD
               Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand 
               and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs 
               into the room)
 
               
                             TINTIN
               No!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Ah, (uses his powers on her) (She uses 
               her powers on him as well) Oh!
 
               
               (The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood 
               dangling above the still active Mole.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases 
               one hand from the railing) Like your 
               father did.
 
               
                             ALAN
               I don't want to save your life. (the 
               Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan 
               grabs it) But it's what we
 
               do.

               
               Scene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to 
               a police car outside the Bank of
 
               London when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them.

               
                             THE HOOD
               See you soon, Jeff.

               
                             PARKER
               (To Lady Penelope as she climbs in the 
               car) Now, that was definitely showing 
               off.
 
               
               Scene changes to back at Tracy Island. Scott, Virgil, John, and 
               Gordon are playing in the pool. Jeff is
 
               grilling with Lady Penelope standing next to him. Fermat is getting 
               swimming lessons from his dad
 
               and Alan is watching.

                             VIRGIL
               Hey, Scott.

               
                             SCOTT
               Get him!

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               (To Jeff) What did you put in these 
               margaritas?
 
               
                             JEFF
               It's a Tracy secret.

               
                             BRAINS
               (To Fermat) That's my boy! One more 
               week and you're gonna be swimming like 
               a F-f-f-D-d-d-
 
               Sha-sha- sha-Aquatic creature.

               
                             ALAN
               Good job, Ferm.

               
                             TINTIN
               (To Alan as she spins around) So, what 
               do you think?
 
               
                             ALAN
               He's getting there. (Looks at Tintin) 
               Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, 
               blossoming.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Ew! Did you say "blossoming"? (smiles 
               at him)
 
               
                             JEFF
               (rings a triangle) Gather around everybody. 
               I have an announcement to make. Tonight 
               is a special
 
               night. We're all together because of three very special people. 
               Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs
 
               Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you. (gives each of them 
               International Rescue pins)
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Mr. Tracy!

               
                             TINTIN
               Thank you, sir. (Camera pans quickly 
               over to Parker who is tearing up)
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts. 
               You earned it. You all did.
 
               
                             PARKER
               (To Onaha and Kyrano) I'm not usually 
               an emotional man, but sometimes even 
               the toughest
 
               nut must crack.

               
                             VIRGIL
               (As all four of Alan's brothers walk 
               over to ruffle his hair and congratulate 
               him) Hey, way to go,
 
               sprout!

               
                             JOHN
               That's my boy, Alan! That's my brother. 
               (Fermat and Alan are thrown into the 
               pool by Scott,
 
               John, Virgil, and Gordon who jump in after them)

               
                             JEFF
               (answering his phone after it rings) 
               Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course, 
               straightaway. Boys.
 
               Sorry, Penny. Duty calls.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Of course it does. And quite right too.
 
               
               
               Scene switches to all five Tracy boys lined up in their uniforms 
               about to go on a rescue mission. The
 
               older four are looking at Alan.

               
                             JEFF
               Thunderbirds are go!

               Scene switches to Lady Penelope and Parker in a pink pedal boat
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Fast as you can, Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Certainly, milady.

               
               Credits Roll with music by Busted playing in the background
 
               
               
                             BUSTED
               Thunderbirds Are Go

               
               Spring breaks come around and there's more heroes to be found.
 
               
               There's something major going down on Tracy island, island. 
               
               
               Weapons underground keeping our planet safe and sound

               If someone evils coming round they should be frightened (frightened)
 
               
               Cause now the boys are back in town. No strings to hold them 
               down down.

               Be sure that there's no coming last cause you're on their side 
               (their side)
 
               
               It always looks so cool when spaceships come out of the pool
 
               
               You know that you'd just be a fool to be a bad guy (bad guy) 
               
               
               Cause now the boys are back in town no strings to hold them down

     FADE IN:
     M.G.M. TRADEMARK                                       A.1

     Leo the Lion ROARS over the FANFARE, then

                                                 FADE OUT:

     GLIDING OBJECTS IN A WIDE DARK VOID - (ANIMATION)

             Out of the SILENT darkness a short white       A
             fluted column surmounted by a SUNDIAL
             appears.  It floats in, waveringly, until
             it becomes clearly visible, then drifts
             off as though moving in some huge orbit.

             Next an HOURGLASS floats in from the left      B
             of the screen.  The faint HISSING OF
             RUNNING SAND breaks the stillness of space.

             As the hourglass glides across the screen,     C
             it is met by a GREEK WATER CLOCK accompanied
             by the sound OF DRIPPING WATER.

             A MEDIEVAL CLOCK with weights arises as its    D
             horizontal escapement TICKS LOUDLY.  Mean-
             while the sundial, hourglass and water clock
             return, drifting at diverse angles across
             the screen.

     THE SOUND of the various devices continues to MOUNT.

             A FIGURE wheels past, with the face of a       E
             clock and the body carved like a drummer
             of the 14th century, BEATING the hour.

             A SMALL CLOCK bears a golden angel with        F
             hammer in hands as it STRIKES A BELL.

             ANOTHER TIMEPIECE, with CHIMES, floats in      G
             to mingle with all the drifting objects.

             The BIG BEN is TOLLING                         H

             Then a GREAT BELL.                             J

     DEAFENING SOUNDS NOW COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, as the time K
     devices weave across the screen and, reaching CRESCENDO,
     STOP abruptly.  A mellow VOICE begins to SING THE THEME of L
     the picture, "The Land Of The Leal".  Simultaneously, the
     screen reveals the MAIN TITLE:                             M

                        "THE LAND OF THE LEAL"

                      Words & Music by Peggy Lee

         When I was a wee lad                               L
         And dark was the night
         Afraid I would be
         Til the bright morning light
         And sometimes...for comfort
         Away I would steal Away
         I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And soon I would be there
         It took me no time
         My heart would be soaring
         As I made the climb
         And there was the green grass
         So cool and so sweet
         So good to be run through
         With happy bare feet!

         And who was my teacher
         And how did I know?
         Just when to be going
         And which way to go?
         But always when wishing
         Away I would steal
         Away I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And now that I'm older
         I try to be wise
         But when I am troubled
         I still close my eyes
         And just like the wee lad
         Away I will steal
         Away I will go to the Land of the Leal.

         For there are no questions
         And there are no lies
         And never a storm there
         To darken the skies
         The birds who are flying
         No freer they feel
         Than I
         When I live in the land of the Leal.

     After the CREDIT TITLES, the MUSIC SUBSIDES and we slowly

                                                 FADE OUT:



     FADE IN:                                               1
     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)

     Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading
     over the snow-patched countryside.  Only the
     laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded
     from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.
     A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of
     the century, lingers in the driveway.  Beyond all
     this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.

     A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and
     KNOCKS on it impatiently.



     AT THE DOOR                                            2

     The knock is answered by MRS. WATCHETT, the house-
     keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair.
     The CAMERA ENTERS the HALL with DAVID FILBY, an
     amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily
     hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes
     toward:



     INT. LIBRARY                                           3

     A pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked
     tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient
     Vintage.

     Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless,
     obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the
     two empty chairs.  The silence is accentuated by the
     merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the
     capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about
     the room.

     Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly
     takes his chair.



     SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS                                  4

               DR. PHILIP HILLYER is an imposing            (a)
               businessman, wearing full sideburns.
               He stares stonily at the last empty
               chair, then at Filby with annoyance.

               ANTHONY BRIDEWELL, a man of the world,       (b)
               impeccably attired in the latest fashion,
               welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by
               lifting his glass of whiskey.

               WALTER KEMP, a middle aged man with keen     (c)
               black piercing eyes, angrily chews on
               his Havana.

               Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     (d)
               as

               Hillyer glances impatiently at his           (e)
               watch, comparing time with a GRAND-
               FATHER CLOCK behind him, then snaps
               it shut and glares at:



     EMPTY CHAIR - MED. SHOT                                5

     Conspicuously unoccupied.



     GRANDFATHER CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                         6

     Reaching the hour of eight, it begins to STRIKE ITS
     YELLOW CHIMES.  Other timepieces JOIN IN the announce-
     ment.



     GROUPSHOT                                              7

     The men look at each other until the CHIMES, BELLS
     ETC. FADE away.  Dr. Hillyer angrily slaps on the
     arm of his leather chair.

                         DR. HILLYER
               I say, this is outright rude of the man!

                         FILBEY
               He's undoubtedly been detained.  That's
               all.

     Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-
     thing but is interrupted by

                         KEMP (unscrews the cigar from
                    his tight lips)
               This is such a confounded waste of
               time!  If he's not coming, I've any
               number of more important things to do.

     All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the
     door quietly behind her.  With an envelope in her
     hand she stands there, hesitating.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Speak up -- what is it, woman?

     She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over
     to Filby and hands him the open envelope.  He
     takes his time in extracting the note.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well...are we or are we not invited
               to dinner?

                         FILBY (reading)
               Apparently we are.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               How long has he been gone?

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervously)
               I can't rightly say, sir. - Several
               days...I hardly catch a glimpse of
               him lately.  He never leaves the
               laboratory and comes out only to
               nibble at his meals...but he did tell
               me days ago about dinner tonight and
               left these instructions.
                    (pointing to note)

                         FILBY
               Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

     A faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and
     with that she retreats toward the door.

                         DR. HILLYER (indicating the
                    note)
               What does it say, Filby?  What's
               wrong?

                         FILBY
               Nothing really. - George merely says
               that if he is not here by eight we're
               to begin without him.

     Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it
     hurriedly.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door
     open and turns around.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Dinner is served, gentlemen!

                         BRIDEWELL (puts his glass
                    down)
               First sensible thing I've heard all
               evening.

     He rises and starts for the dining room.  The others
     follow.



     FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8

     As they walk toward the DINING ROOM.

                         FILBY
               This is peculiar.  He is usually very
               prompt, precise and punctual.

                         DR. HILLYER
               He's making fools of us by inviting
               us here and then not showing up.
               It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

                         KEMP
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

                         DR. HILLYER (agreeing)
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

     Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining
     table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the
     others settle down.  This time the chair at the head
     of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.

                         BRIDWELL (arises, lifting
                    his glass)
               One thing I will say for George, he
               keeps the best cellar in the south of
               England...and Mrs. Watchett is the
               finest cook in the world. - I think
               I'll drink to that!

     The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at
     the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.
     All look in the direction of another door across
     the room.



     THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9

     It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,
     dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
     The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the
     men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm,
     she points toward the long corridor now revealed by
     the open door.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)
               There!...there...

     All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife
     clasped in his hand.



     CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10

     We see the figure of a man approaching, a black
     silhouette against the pale glow at the end of
     the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and
     sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes
     closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,
     but as he nears the doorway, the light from the
     room strikes first his legs, then his body and
     finally his face.  Here he stops.

     This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER
     (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At
     this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing
     is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and
     scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For
     a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light
     and then takes another swaying step into the room.



     FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11

     They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass
     of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down
     before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.

                         FILBY
               Good lord! - What's happened?

     Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.
     Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer
     back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however,
     moves forward under his own power.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm all right...just some food...a
               drink...

     He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With
     trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass
     of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.
     The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?

     A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time
     Traveller empties his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL (a delayed
                    answer)
               Of course.  I'm...all right...

     Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller
     like a mother hen.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (half
                    apology, half concern)
               I didn't recognize you!...it was
               so dark...

     The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup
     for him, but he pushes it away.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Meat...I'm hungry for meat!

     Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr.
     Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge
     portion of beef and loads it onto his plate.



     GROUPSHOT                                              12

     The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him
     curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, can't you speak, man?  What
               happened to you?  Aren't you going
               to tell us...

                         BRIDEWELL
               Leave him alone, can't you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (swallowing)
               It's all right. - I want to tell.

                         FILBY
               It will keep, George.  Eat, rest a
               little.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  I must tell it now... while I
               still remember.

                         FILBY
               Relax, try to relax a bit.  You've
               all the time in the world.



     CLOSE ON THE TIME TRAVELLER                            13

     As he looks up, amused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're right, David.
                    (almost to himself)
               That's exactly what I have. -
               All the time in the world!...
               ever since we were all together
               five days ago, the last day of
               Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.

     Slowly the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER while everyone
     listens so intensely that, aside from the Time
     Traveller's VOICE, only the TICKING of a pendulum
     CLOCK is heard.

                                         SLOWLY DISSOLVE:



     INT. - EBONY BOX ON TABLE - CLOSE SHOT (AFTERNOON)     14

     (NOTE:  The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot
             should give the effect of the Ebony Box
             emerging from the Time Traveller's brain.)

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               There in that box rests the result
               of two years' labor.

     The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal the LIBRARY.  The Time
     Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe,
     sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box.
     Across from him in another chair sits Dr. Hillyer
     puffing his cigar.  Bridewell and Filby have glasses
     in their hands -- Kemp nothing.  All are looking at
     the box.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (continues)
               I wanted to finish the job before
               the new century began. - I barely
               made it.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Marvelous.

                         DR. HILLYER (stands up)
               What is it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, it has to do with time.

                         DR. HILLYER
                    (steps to box)
               I've always maintained what this
               nation needs is a reliable timepiece.
               The Navy needs one. The Army needs
               one. - For the artillery you know.

                         KEMP (leaning forward)
               Couldn't do better, George.  So
               that's why you've been in hiding. -
               Clever of you, indeed!

                         FILBY (studying the Time
                    Traveller's reaction)
               I don't believe George is referring
               to a new kind of timepiece.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               When I speak of time, I'm referring
               to the fourth dimension.

     A perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face.
     Dr. Hillyer registers concern.  Kemp looks troubled.
     Only Filby expresses avid interest.

                         FILBY
               Go on, George.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now, as you know, the difficulty
               in explaining the fourth dimension
               is that it cannot be seen or felt -
               it must be thought of.

                         FILBY
               If you don't mind, George, would
               you refresh me on the first three
               dimensions.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Really, Filby, they must have
               taught you something at school!

                         BRIDEWELL (baiting
                    Dr. Hillyer)
               Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Certainly!
                    (he demonstrates
                     pompously)
               When I move in a straight line,
               forward or backward, that's one
               dimension. - When I move to the
               left or right, two dimensions. -
               When I move up and down, three
               dimensions.
                    (a bright idea lights up
                    his face.  At last he can
                    get ahold of the box, but
                    Filby interferes before
                    Dr. Hillyer can get his
                    fingers on it and he has
                    to be satisfied with merely
                    pointing)
               For instance, this box has three
               dimensions:  length, breadth, and
               height.

                         BRIDEWELL (amazed)
               Well, then, what's the fourth
               dimension?

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, that's...that's mere theory!
               No one can really say what the
               fourth dimension is or even that
               it exists.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         15

     Leaning forward in his chair.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               On the contrary, Doctor!  The
               fourth dimension is as true and as
               real a dimension as any of the
               other three.  In fact, they couldn't
               exist without it.

                         DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT)
               How do you mean?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, take that box.  It has the
               first three dimensions, as you said.
               But what if it didn't exist in Time?
               It wouldn't exist at all, would it?

                         DR. HILLYER
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               So - for an object to exist at all,
               it must exist in the fourth dimen-
               sion....and that fourth dimension
               is duration....Time!

                         DR. HILLYER (impatiently)
               All right!  But what's in that box?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm coming to that.  But first,
               consider!  Why is it that we usually
               ignore the fourth dimension?  Because
               we have no freedom to move in it.  We
               can move in the other three -- up,
               down, forward, backward, sideways.
               But when it comes to Time, we are
               prisoners.  Do you follow me, Anthony?



     GROUP SHOT                                             16

     In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a
     glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.

                         KEMP
               George!  You've given a most lucid
               explanation and all that!  But I
               don't think I entirely understand.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Look!  There are a lot of things in
               the world you don't understand,
               aren't there?

                         KEMP
               Of course!  Quite a number.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you don't refuse to believe
               in them because of that?

                         KEMP
               Not if I can see the proof with
               my own eyes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Good!  All I'm asking you to do
               now is to witness a demonstration
               of the possibility of movement in
               the fourth dimension.
                    (to Dr. Hillyer)
               Philip, will you please hand me
               that box?

     All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to
     the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness,
     and takes it to the Time Traveller.  George opens it
     with great care and brings forth a mechanical device

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I've told you.  The larger model
               can carry a passenger on a journey
               through Time. - Not through Space,
               mind you, but through Time.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Oh, I say George!  If you start
               floating around in the future, aren't
               you likely to mess things up for the
               rest of us?

                         DR. HILLYER
               The future is already there.  It's
               irrevocable and cannot be changed.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                19

     He answers thoughtfully.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's the most important question
               to which I hope to find an answer.
               Can Man control his destiny?  Can he
               change the shape of things to come?



     [PAGE 16 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]



                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Imagine that this cigar is the Time
               Traveller.  Now, this lever in front
               of him controls movement.  Forward
               pressure sends the Machine into the
               future, backward pressure into the
               past.  And the harder the pressure
               the faster the Machine travels.



     GROUPSHOT - LOW ANGLE                                  24

     All eyebrows are raised.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               This experiment can be performed
               only once.  If it succeeds, I lose
               my model forever.  That is why I
               need witnesses.

     They look at each other, uncertain whether he is
     joking or not.  Bridewell stoops with difficulty to
     examine the table.

                         KEMP
               Go ahead.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're ready then?

     Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts
     his finger on the lever.  Then he pauses.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doctor Hillyer, would you care
               to lend me your hand?

     Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling
     weakly.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        25

     Using Dr. Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller
     presses the lever forward.  A LOW-PITCHED HUM is
     heard.



     CLOSE ON THE MEN - LOW ANGLE                           26

     The men stare in fascination as the CAMERA PANS
     and the HUMMING INCREASES.



     INSERT:  GLASSES - CHANDELIER - VASE                   27

               The glasses on the silver tray rattle        (a)
               and clink against each other.

               The gas lights of the chandelier             (b)
               flicker rapidly.

               A vase shudders and moves slightly on        (c)
               the mantelpiece.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        28

     As the vibration increases, the outline of the model
     is blurred and gradually becomes transparent, until
     the Machine with the cigar has vanished utterly.
     The HUMMING HAS REACHED A HIGH SHRIEK and STOPS
     abruptly.



     BACK TO CLOSE ON MEN - LOW ANGLE                       29

     The sudden silence is almost unbearable.  They
     stare at the empty table.  The CAMERA PANS.

                         DR. HILLYER (touches his
                    cigar pocket)
               I'll be damned!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               It worked!

     Filby swallows.

     Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table.
     Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand
     and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of
     reach as he can.  Then, suddenly reversing his
     decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down.

                                                            30 OUT

     TWO SHOT                                               31

     Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Where did it go?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (recovering)
               Go?  Nowhere in the usual sense.
               It's still here.
                    (indicating space where the
                    Machine stood)
               But it's no longer in the present.
               It's traveling through time - to
               the future, to be precise.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Do you seriously expect us to
               believe that?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Certainly.

                         DR. HILLYER
               But you just said it hasn't
               really moved.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's correct.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Then why can't we see it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because we're in this room on
               December 31st, 1899, while the
               model you saw is perhaps a hundred
               years away.  This room, or even
               this house, may no longer exist a
               hundred years from now.  But the
               Time Machine is occupying the same
               space it did a moment before it went
               off on its journey.

     Dr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table.

                         DR. HILLYER (exasperated)
               If it occupies the same space, I
               should be able to feel it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must remember that the space
               you've just put your hand through
               is today's space.  You can't put
               your hand into the space of
               tomorrow.

                         DR. HILLYER (getting angry)
               Space is space!  It doesn't change!
               The same space that is here now should
               be here a hundred or even a thousand
               years from now.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  Time changes space.  This flat
               ground we're standing on now could
               have been at the bottom of the sea
               a million years ago.  And a million
               years from now it could be the
               interior of a huge mountain.

     Dr. Hillyer turns away, speechless.



     GROUP SHOT                                             32

     Kemp steps forward.

                         KEMP
               Suppose what you say is true.
               Exactly what do you suggest we do
               with such a contraption?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               For my part, I intend to take a
               journey into the future. - Unless
               someone else prefers to volunteer.

     There is no response.

                         BRIDEWELL (chuckling)
               I say, George.  Suppose you go off
               and get lost in the fiftieth century!
               How will you find your way back?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (quite
                    serious)
               That's a calculated risk I'm prepared
               to take.

     Dr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges
     significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an
     air of reasonableness.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now listen, George!  I don't
               know what you take us for, but
               we're not fools.  There are a
               number of ways of doing a
               disappearing trick!  But a man of
               your ability should not bother
               with such nonsense.



     CLOSE ON DR. HILLIER - MOVING SHOT                     33

     He gets up from his chair.

                         DR. HILLYER (unable to
                    resist the temptation for
                    sarcasm)
               There's a war on, you know!  The
               Boers are putting up a pretty stiff
               fight in South Africa and our
               country needs inventors like you.
               I can put you in touch with the
               War Office if you wish.

     He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting
     near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box
     with its lid open.  Filby is in the b.g.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (looks
                    up at Filby)
               What do you think?

                         FILBY (hesitating
                    slightly, and then)
               I think Dr. Hillyer has a point,
               George.

     Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the
     Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.  He looks up
     and nods.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now you're being sensible.  I'll
               take care of it first thing in
               the New Year.



     BACK TO GROUP SHOT                                     34

     Everyone rises.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, time to go.

                         KEMP
               Yes, we all have our plans for
               tonight.

     Dr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.  Bridewell
     lingers at the table where the model of the Time
     Machine disappeared.

                         BRIDEWELL (concerned)
               Are you all right, George?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of course, I am.

                         DR. HILLYER'S VOICE
               Coming, Bridewell?

     Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed
     by the Time Traveller.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - FULL SHOT                         35

     While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs,
     gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather
     outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and
     grasps the handle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thanks for coming.

     He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell
     at the rear.

                         AD LIBS
               Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George -
               Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.

     Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder,
     reassuringly.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (DUSK) - (MATTE)            36

     In contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow-
     less wintery day.  The visitors are boarding the
     carriage that awaits them in the drive.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Come on, Bridewell.

     Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then
     submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage
     moves off.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT                              37

     The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door-
     way, waves to them.



     THE CARRIAGE                                           38

     As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving.  From
     the opposite direction another carriage full of NOISY
     YOUNG PEOPLE THUNDERS by.  In early New Year's Eve
     REVELRY they TOOT their toy HORNS at the Time Traveller.



     BACK TO THE TIME TRAVELLER                             39

     Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the
     cottage.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - MED SHOT                          40

     The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his
     back against it, staring into space.  Thinking. - He
     spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by
     one of his guests, and picks it up.



     INSERT: NEWSPAPER                                      40-A

     A ROLL OF DRUMS in military fashion ACCENTS the headline
     that the Boer Army has won another victory.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                40-B

     He closes his eyes and, added to the DRUMS, we HEAR
     the call to battle by a DISTANT BUGLE.  Then more
     BRASS, FIFES and HORNS join the BUGLE and DRUMS to take
     up a MILITANT OVERTURE.

     He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution
     strides toward:

     INT. LIBRARY - LONG SHOT                               57

     The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in
     the f.g.  He stands there and even in the darkness
     WE CAN OBSERVE that he is an angry man.  He strikes
     a match and lights the overhead gas fixture.  The
     light comes up and the MUSIC STOPS as he stares
     across the room to see:



     FILBY - MED. SHOT                                      58

     sitting in a chair near the fireplace.

                         FILBY
               I thought I'd better stay.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               You needn't have troubled yourself.
               I'm all right.

                         FILBY
               No you're not. - You've been
               behaving oddly for over a month
               now.
                    (and then)
               I'm not leaving until you tell me
               what's on your mind.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             59

     Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs
     the coals.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I appreciate your gesture, David,
               but if you don't mind I'd rather
               you left me alone.

                         FILBY
               You have changed, George.
               Enormously.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm sorry.

                         FILBY (looks up to him
                    directly)
               Will you answer me one question
               honestly?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll try.

                         FILBY
               Why this preoccupation with Time?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply)
               Why not?

                         FILBY
               Don't go simple on me, George!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (a beat,
                    then calmly)
               If you want to know the truth, I
               don't much care for the time I was
               born into. - It seems people aren't
               dying fast enough these days.  They
               call upon science to invent new,
               more efficient weapons to depopulate
               the earth.

                         FILBY
               I quite agree with you.  But here
               we are and we have to make the best
               of it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You may have to.  I don't.

                         FILBY (making a half-
                    hearted attempt at levity)
               All right.  Take a journey on your
               contraption.  What would you become?...
               A Greek?  A Roman?  One of the
               Pharaohs?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I prefer the future.

                         FILBY
               You're not seriously saying you can
               do it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You saw the experiment this afternoon,
               didn't you?

                         FILBY
               I saw a toy machine vanish.  But
               I'm certain there are a number of
               ways of doing that trick.  Any
               magician at the Hippodrome could
               probably do it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (angrily)
               It was no trick! - Would you care
               to see the full-scale model?

                         FILBY
               No, I would not!  I have no desire
               to tempt the laws of Providence and
               I don't think you should.  It's not
               for man to trifle with.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.

                         FILBY
               There is something in their common
               sense attitude to life.
                    (and then)
               George, I speak to you as a friend.
               More, as a brother.  If that machine
               can do what you say it can...destroy
               it.  Destroy it, George, before it
               destroys you.

     Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must have plans for New Year's
               Eve.  Don't let me keep you.

                         FILBY
               Mary isn't well.  We decided to
               stay home with the baby.  But why
               don't you come home with me.  You
               haven't seen little Jaime for a
               long time.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I can't.

                         FILBY
               What's stopping you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I just want to see the old century
               out by myself.

                         FILBY (rising)
               Have it your own way.

     He goes to the door.



     AT THE DOOR                                            60

     Filby stops, then turns around.

                         FILBY
               Will you promise me that you won't
               leave the house tonight?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I promise you, I won't walk out of
               the door.

     Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns
     to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and
     steps up to him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               David!  Please don't think me un-
               friendly! - Come over to dinner -
               next Friday.  Won't you?

                         FILBY
               Very well.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Fine...and will you bring the others
               with you?

                         FILBY (with a warm smile)
               Whatever you say, George. - Happy
               New Year.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands)
               And a very happy New Year to you, David.

     Filby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller
     stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then,
     FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table
     and sits down.



     AT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61

     The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the
     new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century."
     He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots
     down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett,
     with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears
     in the doorway and walks up to him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Will you be having supper in this
               evening, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while ex-
                    changing jackets with Mrs.
                    Watchett's help)
               I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why
               don't you take the evening off and
               celebrate.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Thank you, sir, but if you won't be
               needing me I think I'll turn in early
               and get some sleep...
                    (indicating revelers outside)
               ...it I can. - Goodnight, sir.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Goodnight.

     She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Oh, Mrs. Watchett!
                    (as she responds)
               I've invited Mr. Filby and the others
               to dinner next Friday.
                    (and then)
               Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Happy New Year, sir.

     Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once
     again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the
     old calendar that reads:  "December 3l. 1899," rips
     the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight
     little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it
     burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces
     the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily
     scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and
     places it prominently on the table.  He rises and
     mounts the steps that lead to:



     INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62

     The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door
     at the end of the passageway.  Here he pauses momentarily,
     removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then
     slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of
     the picture.



     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                  63

     The laboratory has the appearance of having once been
     a greenhouse.  Only a few potted plants remain.  The
     glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by
     rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight
     is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-
     ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving
     the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov-
     ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps
     through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets
     of drawings and scientific instruments situated around
     the perimeter.

     But the most conspicuous object in the room is the
     Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model
     already seen.

     However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel,
     ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While
     the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the
     full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering
     moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the
     power of movement.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  64

     Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-
     manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,
     then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.  Here
     a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.
     The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the
     crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it
     sparkles like a fine cut diamond.  As he works, his
     lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy
     strains of "The Land Of The Leal."  A clock near him on
     the workbench reads:  "9:30."

     Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming
     handle and crosses to the Machine.  He settles into the
     saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.  There is no
     sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his
     settling himself into the saddle is any more than a
     routine position he has taken before to work on the
     Machine.

     Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)         65

     Passing clouds.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 66

     He looks upwards for several moments.  Then his hand
     slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the
     lever. - Gently he urges it forward.

     A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,
     but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from
     within the Machine.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANEL                             67

     The luminous dials show:  "31 December 1899."  The
     meters and indicators start to BUZZ and whirl.  The
     glow increases.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 68

     His expression is taut as he looks around, then down
     to the control panel.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I started...and the laboratory grew
               faint around me...



     INSERT OF PANEL                                        69

     The figures spin, the needles vibrate.  Then almost
     at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the
     lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine.  The
     HUMMING LESSENS and FADES.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 70

     As he starts to look up and around, slowly.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...I stopped.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             71

     Starting at the WINDOW with frost around the edges
     and icicles outside, we move around the room PASSING
     THE WORKBENCH over to the DOOR.  During this we HEAR the:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               No change; everything exactly as it
               bad been before. - But no!

     THE CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO THE WORKBENCH, CLOSE, where
     the clock now shows "11:09" and the candle has burned
     shorter.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (excited)
               The clock said 9:31 when I started and
               now it was 11:O9...and the candle,
               shorter by inches.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 72

     He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch
     from his pocket by its gold chain.  It flips open
     showing almost "9:32."

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And yet by my watch which was in the
               machine with me, only a few seconds
               had passed.

     Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the
     lever, looking off toward the:



     WORKBENCH - (ANIMATION)                                73

     The HUMMING SOUND STARTS again and, while the hands
     of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle
     flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the
     candle down.  The CAMERA MOVES to the window where the
     frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow.
     Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like
     gems and the sun starts to rise.



     TIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74

     The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab-
     oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and
     his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks
     up and squints.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It was disconcerting to see the sun...



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (STOP MOTION OR        75
     ANIMATION)

     As the sun arches majestically.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...arc in less than a minute...

               for the night, changes that normally
               took hours, occuring in seconds, was
               beautiful.

     During this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL
     rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then
     the flowers start to open again.  Light begins to flood
     the scene.

     In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses
     the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with
     the speed of wind streaks away.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 77

     A trace of a smile, then apprehension.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And as yet I was travelling very slowly!
                    (challenging)
               What if I went faster?!

     His hand shoves the lever farther over toward the
     future position.

     THE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time
     Traveller lurches in his seat, clings to the controls
     and looks at the dials.

     The sun soars across the sky, night falls.  Pin points
     of stars streak by and dawn comes.  The sun is chased
     by the stars again and again.  Faster and faster.



     VERY CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                           81

     His eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half
     pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating
     flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of
     another day.

     He turns toward the:



     WINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82

     Without a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has
     disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring.
     While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around
     the window like a snake and the flowers open and close,
     we see the following through repeated fast flashes.

                    The sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a)

     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83

     Quick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's
     face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It became intoxicating.  To see an
               entire storm in a few seconds. -
               So I pushed the lever on toward
               even greater speed.

     He applies greater pressure on the lever.  The
     HUMMING INCREASES.  The alternate flashes of light
     become a flicker almost too fast for the eye to
     follow.  He looks o.s. and sees:



     EXT. TREE IN GARDEN - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)          84

     Its shadows, cast by the sun and the moon, dance
     around the trunk, faster and faster -- the moon
     passing through its phases and the sun shifting
     its position with the seasons.



     BRANCHES - CLOSE SHOT - (ANIMATION)                    85

     Leaves grow quickly.  Flowers appear and turn into
     small green apples.  Growing larger, they turn red
     and fall.  The leaves gradually become amber and
     disappear.  Suddenly the bare branches are covered
     with snow for a few seconds, then again burst into
     green leaves and blossoms.



     EXT. DISTANT HILLSIDE - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)        86

     Through the window we see the trees grow and
     change like puffs of vapor -- now brown, now
     green; they spread, shiver and pass away.  Snow
     flashes across the country, vanishes and is
     followed by the brief bright green of Spring.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thirteen years had passed...fourteen...
               fifteen...sixteen...and then...

     Gradually soot, dirt and grime has built up on the
     windows from the outside and darkness prevails.

     His brow is beaded with perspiration.  Alarmed,
     he grabs the handle of the Time Machine.



     INSERT:  THE DIALS                                     88

     The hand of the Time Traveller quickly pulls back
     the lever.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               In the year nineteen hundred seventeen...
               I stopped.

     The flickering of passing days and nights slows and
     the HUMMING SOUND GRADUALLY DIMINISHES.  The dial
     stops on "13 September 1917".



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             89

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he steps out of his Machine
     and glances with astonishment around the interior
     of the laboratory.  The once clear windows are now
     dirty and boarded up.  The world outside is
     completely obscured from view.  Only faint light
     penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out-
     doors.  He crosses to the door.  Dust falls as he
     opens it and enters the corridor.



     INT. LIBRARY                                           90

     The dim light and the protective sheets covering
     the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a
     ghostly appearance.  Tilted paintings reveal
     faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches
     thick here, as well as in the dining room seen
     in the b.g.  Cobwebs are everywhere.

     The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time
     Traveller, coming down the steps from the
     corridor, enters the room and looks about.



     THE SHELVES - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                  91

     Among his books still rest the clocks, his once
     prized possessions.  There is NO TICKING now.
     The hands of the clocks, each pair indicating a
     different time, seem to guard the past.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  92

     Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the
     library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front
     door.  It refuses to respond to his attempt to
     open it.  Even when he uses his shoulder it does
     not budge.  He steps back and flings his full
     weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it
     gives slightly.  Under continued pressure the
     nailed boards outside give way and a flood of
     daylight illuminates the dusty interior.  The
     Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that
     is now taken over by weeds.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - DAY                         93

     The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks
     curiously around.  Everything is overgrown with
     vines and flowers.  The house is boarded up.  He
     starts to wander around, thinking, investigating.

     (NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with
             distinctive landmarks that will stay
             recognizable during his journey into
             the future, thereby giving a clear
             conception that time-travelling does
             not involve geographical movement.
             For instance, the sharp curve of the
             River Thames in the distance will
             remain even after the house itself
             has disappeared.)

     Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE
     catches his attention.  He looks puzzled toward:



     EXT. ROAD - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                          95

     Coming up the hill on a narrow dusty road is a
     car of 1916 vintage, with the HORN HONKING.  The
     CAMERA PANS with it, up to a SMALL STORE across
     the street.  The sign above the entrance reads:
     "Filby's Department Store".  A MANNEQUIN,
     dressed for the period, is in the window.  The
     driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of
     the First World War, steps out of the car.  The
     Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend,
     sans moustache.



     TWO SHOT                                               96

                         TIME TRAVELLER (glibly)
               Going to a masquerade, David?  You
               look rather silly without your
               moustache, old man!

                         FILBY (puzzled)
               Were you addressing me, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (positively)
               Filby!  I expected more of an
               enthusiastic greeting from...

                         FILBY (smiles as he
                    interrupts)
               I'm afraid you have me confused
               with my father, sir.  There was a
               remarkable resemblance. - I'm
               James Filby.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Was?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Were you a friend of father's?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...yes...I've been away.

                         JAMES FILBY
               He was killed in the war...a year
               ago.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (aghast)
               No!...it can't be...
                    (then, as he realizes its
                    truth)
               I'm sorry to hear that.
                    (pause, then hesitantly
                    points)
               And the gentleman who used to live
               across the street?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Oh, him.  Some inventor who
               disappeared around the turn of the
               century. - If you're interested in
               that house, forget it.  You can't
               buy it or even go inside.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why is that?

                         JAMES FILBY
               My father was executor of the
               inventor's estate and he refused to
               liquidate it.
                    (adds with a smile)
               I often chided him on that account,
               but he felt positive that the owner
               would return some day. - Some people
               hereabouts think it's haunted.
                    (stares at Time Traveller
                    curiously, studying the
                    strange cut of his clothes)
               Who are you, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Just a stranger who once knew your
               father.

                         JAMES FILBY
               I see.
                    (still curious at the Time
                    Traveller's abstract attitude)
               Have you been at the front, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Front?  What front?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Why the war, of course.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What war?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Great heavens, man, don't you know
               we've been at war with Germany
               since nineteen fourteen?  I thought
               perhaps you had seen action in
               France...or maybe...
                    (noticing confusion, adds
                    with a note of compassion)
               Perhaps a cup of tea would make
               you feel better.  Won't you come in?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No...no, thank you.

                         JAMES FILBY
               You're sure you're alright, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes, I'm quite alright.

                         JAMES FILBY (hesitantly)
               Then...goodbye, sir.

     The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly
     turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the
     Department Store.

     friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the
     street and returns to the cottage.

               As I went along, I gained experience
               in handling the Machine.  I found
               that I could stop for a day, an hour,
               or even for a second to observe, then
               go ahead for a year or two. - Thus I
               was able to see the changing world
               in a series of glimpses.

     With the speed of wind, pedestrians streak across

     get shorter and shorter, then drop inch by inch
     while the hair styles vary.  The bosom appears to
     swell with the sinking neckline and flattens as
     the neckline rises.  During this:

               had a mechanical defect or a part
               had worn out.

     The Time Traveller HEARS the SCREAMS of DIVING
     PLANES.  He stops the Machine and looks up at:

     swept by beams of searching lights.

     ANTI-AIRCRAFT batteries are FIRING as a squadron
     of Nazi fighter planes are caught in the criss-
     cross beams of light.  The sky is pierced with
     ack ack.  Then, following the sound OF APPROACHING RAF.
     FIGHTER PLANES, a dog fight ensues.  Several of the

               The last time I had stopped was in
               nineteen seventeen, twenty three years
               ago.  And the war with Germany was
               still waging - now in the air with
               flying machines.  It didn't seem
               possible they could go on fighting
               all these years and still have the
               means of fighting.  Then I realized
               the truth of the matter.  This was a
               new war.  There must have been an
               interval of peace in between these
               wars.  Yet they had learned nothing
               but to prepare even more effective
               means of destroying one another.  I
               decided to push on into time and see
               the outcome.

               The fighting in the sky lasted only
               a few moments.  By nineteen forty five
               it was over, but I continued on a
               few more years before pausing for
               another glimpse of my silent, never

     BACK AT THE MANNEQUIN                                  115

     Dressed in the sleek dress of the future.  First
     a distant, then a close AIR RAID SIREN HOWLS,
     menacingly.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 116

     His smile becomes a puzzled stare at what he sees.



     EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117

     People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND
     OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions
     comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period
     in disorder.

     The running is purposive, however.  All are entering
     particular buildings or, like those closest to the
     Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the
     sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky-
     ward.

     A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped
     as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers
     her up in his arms and rushes back to safety.

     In a few seconds the streets are deserted.



     TIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT               118

     The Time Traveller gets out and looks around,
     confused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               At first I wondered if my Machine and
               I were the cause of the panic.  I was
               to soon find out we weren't.

     He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA
     MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair-
     way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one
     below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s.,
     a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly,
     until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's
     attention.



     EXT. STORE WINDOW - FULL SHOT                          119

     A TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is
     operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra
     led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow.
     The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S
     DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches
     the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he
     intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors
     fly wide open.

     He stops startled, looking about to see who opened
     them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward.



     INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LONG SHOT                      120

     From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes
     the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller
     enters and turns his attention to other products
     of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,
     reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the
     significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud
     of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he
     is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks
     off.



     REVERSE SHOT                                           121

     Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a
     plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white
     crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian
     Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask
     as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (shakes his head)
               I can't understand you.

     The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David
     Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young
     man.  He is now in his mid-sixties.

                         WARDEN
                    (looking at helmet)
               Confounded radio in this thing.
               Makes more noise than it does sense.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (recognizing him)
               Filby!

                         WARDEN
               My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't
               you hear the air raid siren?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You mean that horrible screeching?

                         WARDEN
               It wasn't constructed for its
               aesthetic values, you know, but to
               warn silly young fools like yourself
               to get down into the shelter.  Now
               go on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But I'm perfectly comfortable and
               I find your store magnificent.  What
               splendid achievements, what gigantic
               strides mankind has taken, what...

                         WARDEN
                    (interrupting)
               Come on, young man.  We'd better be
               going before the mushrooms start
               sprouting.
                    (looks at Time Traveller
                    with renewed interest)
               You do look familiar.  Haven't
               we met somewhere before?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many
               years ago.

                         WARDEN
               I was sure of that, but the exact
               time escapes me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               It was two wars ago, I believe.
               Nineteen seventeen.

                         WARDEN (awed)
               Why now I recall.  The chap who
               inquired about my father -- and
               the house that used to be across
               the way.
                    (stops and stares at
                    the Time Traveller)
               But no...that's impossible.  You
               haven't changed.  You're not a day
               older.  And your clothes...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm afraid it's going to take me
               a little time to explain... You see...

     There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.  It
     lasts for three seconds.

                         WARDEN
               The last alert...hurry!

     He grabs the Time Traveller by the arm and drags
     him out.



     ON THE STREET - FULL SHOT                              122

     They emerge from the store.  The Time Traveller
     pulls himself free.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen to me!  It's important.

                         WARDEN (points to sky)
               Look!  An atomic satellite zeroing
               in!  That's important!!

     The Warden runs, looks back over shoulder, calling.

                         WARDEN
               Hurry!  Hide 'til the All Clear!

     He descends into the air raid shelter.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  123

     He looks puzzled.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               All clear?
                    (yells)
               I've got to talk to you.

     The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the
     APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE.  Alarmed,
     he runs across the street directly in the path
     of the ambulance that threads its way between the
     cars left in disorder on the road.  The driver
     spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts
     crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller.
     Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.  He stops and
     looks startled.



     VIEW THROUGH THE STREETS - LONG SHOT - (STOCK,         124
     MINIATURE, SPLIT)

     A SATELLITE travels over the city in the distance.
     The flash is followed by an EXPLOSION and a giant
     cobalt mushroom begins to rise over the horizon.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          125

     As the Time Traveller tries again to rush toward
     his Machine, the shockwaves reach him and throw him
     to the ground.  He looks back, desperately.



     THE CITY - LONG SHOT - (MINIATURE)                     126

     Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see
     the once proud city of the future in ruins.  Only
     a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand-
     ing for a moment, then it also collapses in an instant.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The labor of centuries gone in an
               instant.

     The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden
     a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as
     though the earth were being torn apart.  It zig-zags
     down the street and from the widening fissure clouds
     of smoke and steam rise.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's
               violence, responded with volcanic
               violence or her own!



     CHASM IN THE GROUND - (STOCK)                          127

     The smoke and steam give way to a spluttering of
     red hot lava which swells slowly at first in a
     rising tide and then spilling over begins to
     EXPLODE into the air.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 128

     The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the
     Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.



     THE THAMES - LONG SHOT - (STOCK)                       129

     As the river spills over its bed and turns into
     another direction.



     THE STREETS - (STOCK, MINIATURE, SPLIT)                130

     With red hot lava swirling around the bases of the
     remaining buildings.  The lower parts of the struct-
     ures in the f.g. dissolve into smoke and flame and
     the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising
     red flood.  Then the incoming rush of the river
     meets the flowing tide of lava.  The two opposite
     elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf
     the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and
     meet with explosive fury.  The air is rent with the
     SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling
     rock.  Steam whitens the sky.



     THE TIME MACHINE - LONG SHOT - (STOCK) - (PROCESS)     131

     Out of the tumult a flow of red hot lava turns
     aside and leaps directly toward the Time Machine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Then I saw my own danger.  I too was
               to be engulfed!



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                132

     As he sees his great peril.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But to go back was unthinkable.

     He jams the lever forward to its furthest position.
     The HUMMING SOARS TO A VERY HIGH PITCH.



     THE ENCROACHING LAVA - (STOCK)                         133

     It has been approaching with the speed of a torrent,
     but now it literally leaps forward in a blinding
     red haze that engulfs the entire scene.



     THE TIME MACHINE - MED. SHOT                           134

     The interior of the Machine is permeated with a dull
     red glow which seems to flow like mist all about the
     Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Only my speed through time saved me
               from being roasted alive and encased
               in stone forever.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        135

     They are spinning too fast to distinguish anything
     in the gradually fading red glow.



     EXTREME CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                        136

     His face is bathed in sweat.  His eyes search the
     growing darkness.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The molten rock cooled.
                    (he closes his burning
                    eyes as the last of the
                    light vanishes)
               I prayed...wondering how many centuries,
               how many eons must pass before the wind
               and rain could wear away the mountain
               that enclosed me.

     In the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of
     the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED
     BREATHING of the Time Traveller.

     Then a match flickers.  The CAMERA SCARES BACK.  The
     Time Traveller holds up a burning matchstick, his
     face glistening with perspiration as he leans forward
     to look at the dials.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (whispering)
               Darkness...darkness for centuries.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        137

     They roll very fast.  We can distinguish only the
     passing of years -- 70,000...80,000...90,000...
     100,000.  Then the matchlight flickers and goes
     out leaving only the dial's own faint glow.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 138

     Once again there is darkness and the MONOTONOUS HUM
     of the Time Machine.  He breathes heavily and tries
     to calm himself.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I wondered if there was still war
               being waged on the ground above me...
               if man would still exist on earth,
               when I saw the sun again.

     As he speaks, the Time Machine goes faster and faster.
     HIGH PITCHED HUMMING INCREASES.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The centuries rolled by. - I put
               my trust in time and waited for
               the rock to wear down around me.

     A white light from above begins to permeate the dark-
     ness.  The Time Traveller looks up, his face showing
     immense relief.



     WHAT HE SEES - (ANIMATION)                             139

     Rocks deteriorate and a bright blue sky bursts into
     view.  ACCENT ON MUSIC.



     EXT. TIME MACHINE AND GROUND NEARBY - LONG SHOT        140
     (SPLIT, ANIMATION)

     Everything is a blur except the Time Machine with its
     passenger.  The black rock on the surface slowly melts
     away and the flickering sunlight returns.  The Machine
     is now finally entirely above ground, the only distinct
     object in the whirling transparent landscape.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT                       141

     As he smiles gratefully up at the sky.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I was free again!

     He looks o.s.



     INDISTINCT COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - (ANIMATION)       142

     There is an impression of several great buildings
     set wide apart by green landscape -- a landscape
     which no longer changes color even though trees
     spring up like plumes of green smoke.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thousands of centuries passed, but
               the earth stayed green!  There was
               no winter!  No wars! - Had man finally
               learned to control both the elements
               and themselves? - I had to stop and
               find out.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             143

     As he eagerly pulls hard on the lever, the HUMMING
     DECREASES and the dial freezes on:  "23 November
     802,701".  THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the
     Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.  The CAMERA
     ZOOMS BACK TO A FULL HIGH SHOT as the machine keels
     over.  The friction caused by the intrusion creates
     a pitiless HAIL, and we

                                    SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT - (DAY)               144

     Thick mist eddies about his face, undulating
     dreamily, revealing enough to see that he is
     unconscious.  Blood seeps from a gash across his
     forehead.  He dazedly opens his eyes to find that
     he is gazing across the dewey, green turf.  Then
     he looks up.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - LOW ANGLE - (MATTE)      145

     The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great
     bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon
     clawed feet support the white marble figure of an
     immense Sphinx.  The figure has the face of a
     woman, the body of a huge cat and the tail of a
     serpent.  A weeping birch tree barely touches its
     outspread wings.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         146

     He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED
     BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.  Still half-
     dazed he presses a handkerchief to his temple, as
     he loosens his collar, then reaches into the Machine,
     pockets the lever and surveys his surroundings.



     LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT - (MATTE)                        147

     It looks like a garden untended for centuries.  The
     trees and shrubs are laden with strange blossoms or
     exotic fruits.

     In the distance there is a building that might once
     have been a temple.  Vines mat the ancient walls,
     seemingly holding them together.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 148

     He smiles.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to himself)
               At last I've found a Paradise.

     He starts off toward the building WHISTLING his
     favorite tune, "The Land Of The Leal".  The CAMERA
     ACCOMPANIES him as he looks about with interest.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             149

     Strange, exotic fruits bend the branches of the
     TREES, some purplish and gourd-shaped, others
     suggesting giant raspberries, mangoes, etc.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Nature tamed completely and more
               bountiful than ever before.



     VARIETY OF FLOWERS - MOVING SHOT                       150

     The CAMERA PANS under boughs laden with orchids and
     a multitude of other gorgeous blossoms.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Flowers everywhere...the whole landscape
               one vast garden with no sign of weeds or
               briars.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT - (DAY)    151

     The Time Traveller pauses and looks up at the building.



     ACROSS FACADE - PAN DOWN - (MINIATURE?)                152

     Vines creep up the crevices.  The ornamental stone
     work, while rich in detail, is weathered and
     broken with age.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (surprised)
               Unrepaired for centuries!  Maybe
               unlived in for as long.
                    (then)
               It would be no Paradise if it
               belonged to me alone.



     INT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT                              153

     Shooting through the ARCHWAY we see the Time
     Traveller mount the steps and enter the building.



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (MATTE) - (DAY)      154

     In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller
     halts.  He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted
     ceiling.  Although ancient in appearance, everything
     is ultra modern in design.  Sunlight streams through
     windows where half the panes of stained glass are
     broken.  Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along
     the walls, and at random about the floor are low
     tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls
     of fruit.

     His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the
     Time Traveller crosses to:



     A TABLE - MED. SHOT                                    155

     The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of
     exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as
     though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication
     of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air
     hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time
     Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his
     eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to
     this strange place.  There is none.

     Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS
     with it on the top of the table.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouting)
               Anyone here?

     But an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re-
     traces his steps and leaves the great hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     156

     Pick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along.
     Every sense he possesses is on the alert.  His eyes
     probe every bush and tree and object that could
     possibly conceal some person or thing.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        157-161

     As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk,
     INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects
     he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he
     reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life
     or movement.

     The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave
     of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows
     as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into
     tension and gradually but inevitably approaches
     the state of horror that a human being would
     experience in a strange place where he had just
     come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe
     fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but
     weird vacuum.



     EXT. WOODED AREA - LONG SHOT                           162

     As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees,
     he hesitates, then moves into the forest.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        163-166

     The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of
     darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles
     to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks
     with continued wariness through the trees, glancing
     from left to right and occasionally stopping dead
     still and quickly darting a glance behind him at
     what he imagines to be some sound of movement.
     But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is
     nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest.

     Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar
     and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND
     SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some
     dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out.



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167

     The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by
     the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the
     PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool
     and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand.
     They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace
     and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new
     world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded
     by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it
     from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream
     emerges in a swift torrent.



     ANOTHER, CLOSER SHOT                                   168

     A beautiful GIRL, dressed in a silken robe of white
     and gold, starts running.  As she runs, she loosens
     her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep
     into the crystal water.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                169

     He smiles philosophically and leans back against a
     tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (musingly,
                    to himself)
               So this is man's future...



     GROUP SHOT                                             170

     The people, apparently without any cares of the
     world, play, romp and swim.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               ...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in
               the clear streams and eat the fruits
               of earth with all knowledge of work
               and hardship forgotten.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 171

     He pauses, thinking back on what he has just said.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, and why not?

     Suddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool.
     He turns.



     THE POOL - LONG SHOT                                   172

     The Girl has swum out too far and is caught by the
     swift torrent.  She CRIES OUT PITEOUSLY.

     The other people turn their heads toward her, but
     make no move to help.



     CLOSE ON GIRL                                          173

     She has caught a ledge of rock and clings.  Two
     little men, their bare feet dangling in the water,
     sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           174

     He jumps out from the foliage, rushes to the bank,
     points toward the Girl and tries to attract the
     attention of those near her on the bank.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Help her!...

     No one moves.  He runs toward the ledge.



     BACK TO THE GIRL                                       175

     Her grasp on the ledge grows weaker.  She is at
     the point of letting go.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           176

     Reaching the ledge, he pushes past the people nearby
     and grasps the Girl's wrist just as her fingers
     slip.  Quickly, he pulls her out of the river's
     turbulent current and lifts her up in his arms.



     GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE UP                                177

     Looking up at the Time Traveller bewildered, she
     shows neither fear nor gratitude.



     TIME TRAVELLER - EXTREME CLOSE UP                      178

     Gazing back at the Girl thoroughly puzzled.  He
     turns and glances down at the two little people
     on the ledge.



     CLOSE TWO SHOT                                         179

     These two men will later be known as the YOUNG MAN
     and the MAN IN WHITE.  They return the Time Travel-
     ler's look of scorn with pleasant smiles as if they
     do not know the meaning of a mean look.



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE, MOVING SHOT     180

     Trying to avoid looking at the dripping, robeless
     Girl - after all he is a Victorian - he carries her
     to the safety of the bank and sets her down on the
     sandy beach beneath the trees.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him as he straightens, then quickly takes off his
     jacket and throws it around her.

     He looks at her for the first time sees the almost
     ultimate in feminine beauty.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - FULL SHOT                      181

     Wearing his velvet jacket very appealingly, she
     calmly rises, turns and, without a word, walks
     away.  The Time Traveller stares after her in
     astonishment.

     The disconcerned people, now all dressed in multi-
     colored robes, are leaving the pool.  They walk
     past the Time Traveller as though he was a part of
     the scenery, merely adding to his confusion.

     Perplexed.

                                      DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - (SUNSET)         183

     Shooting toward the ARCHWAY.  The sun is sinking as
     the last stragglers of the little people enter the
     great hall.  The Time Traveller slowly follows them.
     He pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back
     to either welcome him or resent his intrusion, but
     they move on with lack of interest, completely.  He
     sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this
     utter indifference.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             184

     Seated on the steps leaning against a column.  He
     senses another's presence, looks about, sees no one,
     then turns to glance over his shoulder.  The Girl, now
     wearing her robe and holding his jacket over her arm,
     appears from behind the column.  He looks at her and
     smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her. -
     She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and
     returns his jacket.  While he slowly slips it on,
     she slides down a step to sit alongside him.

                         THE GIRL
               Why did you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why did I what?

                         THE GIRL
               Come after me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (ironic)
               I did it to save your life, young
               lady, which I'm afraid doesn't hold
               much meaning for you or anyone else.

                         THE GIRL (simply)
               It doesn't.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Must have been fifty of your friends
               watching you drown.  Not one of
               them so much as lifted a finger. -
                    (shakes his head)
               A curious attitude - in a curious
               world.
                    (a pause, then a
                    smile)
               Aren't you the least bit interested
               in what I am...where I come from?

                         THE GIRL (innocently)
               Should I be?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiles)
               Perhaps you'd better take me to
               someone a bit older I can talk to.

                         THE GIRL
               There is no one older.

     The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth
     of her words.  All of the little people seem to be
     of the Girl's age or younger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone age in this land
               of yours?

     The Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the
     sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already
     fallen over the distant hills.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's your name?

                         THE GIRL
               Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you spell that?

                         WEENA
               Spell?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Write!  - Can't you write?  Look!

     He bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw
     on the ground.



     INSERT: DUST                                           185

     BACK TO SCENE                                          186

     She shows little interest.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               And what are your people called?

                         WEENA (as if he ought to know)
               Eloi.



     INSERT OF DUST                                         187

     The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          188

     A shadow crosses her face.  Suddenly she springs
     to her feet, concerned.

                         WEENA
               Come.  We must go in.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (rising)
               Why?  What's wrong?

                         WEENA (anxiously)
               It is getting dark.

     She grabs his hand and pulls him toward:



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - LONG SHOT - (MATTE?) - (DAY)     189

     Crowded now.  The people of the future are sitting
     on cushions around the tables, having their evening
     meal.  The glowing orange light of the setting sun
     pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at-
     mosphere to the place.  No one pays attention to
     Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the
     b.g.



     AT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190

     A score of attractive young men and young women are
     enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos-
     phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look
     up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the
     table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He
     takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White
     who sit across the table from him and tries to engage
     them in conversation.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (directed to
                    Young Man, but meant for the
                    entire group)
               I don't mind telling you, I'm quite
               hungry.  I've come a long, long way.

     Looks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is
     none.

     He bites into the fruit.  It's good.  While he is

     subject.

               In my time a berry this size would

     There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man
     again.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.
               Perhaps even courtesy has died, but
               I have come a long way and there are
               things I would like to know.

                         YOUNG MAN (considers a
                    moment, then)
               Why?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because I shall return to my time
               and they will ask questions such as
               what kind of government rules your
               world.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               We have no government.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (speaking
                    as though to a child)
               You must have a body of men who pass
               and enforce laws.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               There are no laws.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (taken aback,
                    then)
               How do you get your food and clothing?

     The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him.
     They both shrug their shoulders.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone work?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks up
                    fruit)
               Then where does this come from?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               It grows.  It always grows.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But it must be planted, cultivated,
               nurtured...unless...
                    (with mistaken insight as he
                    observes no reaction to this
                    last query)
               Unless you have an economy so well
               organized that you can devote all your
               time to study and experimentation.
               Am I right?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               You ask many questions.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (annoyed)
               Yes!  And I'm not ashamed of it.
               That is how man has learned and
               bettered himself.  I must learn about
               you and your civilization.  You have
               books, don't you?

                         YOUNG MAN (recognizing a
                    half-forgotten word)
               Books. - Books!  Yes, we have books.

     He rises and beckons.  The Time Traveller's brow
     clears.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Books will tell me what I want to
               know.  Books will tell me all about
               you.

     He too gets up and follows the Young Man.



     AT THE WALL - LONG SHOT                                193

     The Young Man leading.  He reaches the wall and
     seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.  A
     cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the
     curtain falls, almost crumbling.  Shelves and
     shelves of books are disclosed.  The books are
     old even though many of them have futuristic de-
     signs.  The bindings of once proud volumes hang in
     brown tatters.  The Time Traveller steps to the
     books.

     The realization of the true state of affairs shows
     on his face.  He is appalled.  Carefully he pulls
     a volume from the shelf.  Its binding breaks as
     he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages,
     they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor.
     He drops the book.  His voice is a shocked WHISPER.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...they do tell me all about you!

     With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole
     shelf of books.  His hand plows through them and
     the dust swirls into the air.  He turns back in
     anger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What have you done?  Thousands of
               years of building and rebuilding
               creating and re-creating so that
               you can let it crumble to dust.

     With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               A million yesterdays of sensitive
               men dying for their dreams.  For
               what?  So you can swim and dance
               and play.

     He releases him and leaves.



     THE HALL - MOVING SHOT                                 195

     The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating
     them for their dissipation.

     Without emotion they watch him walk toward the
     entrance.  Only Weena jumps to her feet.  Her
     former indifference is gone.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        196

     From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down
     at them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I am returning to my time!  Not to
               tell of the uselessness of the
               struggle - not to tell of the
               hopeless future - but only so that
               I can die among men!

     He turns and strides toward the door.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197

     The Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A
     moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She
     stands there, looking after him.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. FOREST - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                      198

     There are patches of mist and haze between the
     trees.  With a blazing torch the Time Traveller
     strides across.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER ON THE PATH - (NIGHT)              199

     Coming from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO
     THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking
     the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con-
     sternation.  He raises the torch high to see:



     EXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200

     There is no Time Machine.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201

     In stunned shock.



     THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202

     Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries
     toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn
     looking for his Machine, beating the branches with
     his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes,
     a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and
     disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the
     Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn
     where the Machine was last seen.

     (NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot
             where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)

     He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.
     Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud-
     denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the
     pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he
     had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.
     Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his
     knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes
     the grass.



     THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203

     The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as
     though some heavy object had been dragged across.
     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves
     and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot-
     prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned
     earth.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204

     He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed.
     Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow-
     ing the grooves.



     BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves
     straight across the lawn to the flagstones around
     the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the
     stones leading to the wide panel in the base of
     the pedestal.  Here the marks end.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206

     The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an
     exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.

     The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the
     claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free,
     he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either
     to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife
     from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's
     edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success.

     Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a
     loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this
     heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow
     it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times
     he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock
     shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207

     He senses he is under observation by an unseen
     presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up
     to:



     THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208

     The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in
     the torch light.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209

     He turns and peers toward:



     THE BUSHES                                             210

     In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a
     wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the
     flame of the torch.



     TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213

     He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly
     paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap-
     proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,
     followed by a ghostly impression of pale,
     fleeing creatures.

     The Time Traveller halts and turns in another
     direction.  The same thing happens.

     Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch
     against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now
     in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering
     around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves
     into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.



     THE PATH                                               214

     Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure
     approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the
     other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment
     there is a struggle and then the other figure lies
     perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to
     get a look at it.



     THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216

     It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller
     reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an
     expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be
     waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does
     not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the
     Time Traveller and her face records a wave of
     relief.

     The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time
     Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.

                         WEENA
               I heard you pounding...I came to
               tell you...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you open that panel?

                         WEENA
               No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?

     A look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts
     her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.
     Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns
     her to face him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?

     Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups
     his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her
     head back so that her eyes meet his.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Tell me.

                         WEENA
               When they call, we must go below.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Do the Morlocks live beneath the
               earth?
                    (Weena nods)
               Why must you obey their command?

                         WEENA
               They give us the food we eat, the
               clothes we wear.  We must do as
               they command.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What happens to your people when
               they go below?

                         WEENA (repressing an in-
                    voluntary shudder)
               No one knows.  No one has ever
               returned.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling
                    at her warmly, reassuringly)
               It won't happen to you.

     Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find-
     ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot
     understand.  Then she glances high into the dark sky
     and the old fear returns.

                         WEENA
               It is night.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Only children are frightened by
               the dark. - But then you are a
               child, aren't you?
                    (Weena glances around
                    warily into the shadows,
                    her anxiety mounting)
               I'll build a fire.

                         WEENA (taking his
                    hand, rises)
               Let us go from here.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (getting
                    up)
               I can't, child.
                    (walking toward the sphinx)
               My Machine is inside there, I
               intend to wait here 'til morning,
               then find some way of getting
               inside.

                         WEENA (catching up)
               No, you must not.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (stops,
                    then)
               Help me gather some wood.

     Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which
     she hands over to him.

                         WEENA
               Where are you from?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks
                    up dry branches)
               As a matter of fact, I'm from
               right here.
                    (gesturing)
               There's where my house stood many
               thousands of years ago.  Here - to
               that monument, was my laboratory.
               About there was my library where I
               once sat talking with friends about
               my Time Machine.

     Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the
     bushes in the f.g.

     She watches every move he makes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               I hoped to learn a great deal.  I
               hoped to take back the knowledge,
               the advancement, mankind made...
               instead what do I find?  Vegetables!

     Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly
     from behind her.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219

     With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (continuing)
               The human race reduced to living
               vegetables!



     BACK TO WEENA                                          220

     The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear
     paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221

     He is about to light a match, but finds he needs
     more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Get me a few more twigs.

     When there is no answer he turns and looks.



     AT THE BUSHES                                          222

     Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to
     RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena
     slowly disappearing under the brush.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223

     We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING
     FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller
     toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws
     her to the pile of dry branches.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after calming her)
               What was it?

                         WEENA (low)
               Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (strikes
                    match and holds it to twigs)
               This seems to keep them away.

     She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly
     she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the
     flame.



     TWO SHOT                                               225

     The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost
     too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more
     amazement than pain.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while
                    examining her hand)
               What ever made you put your hand in
               the fire?

                         WEENA
               I never saw it before.

     Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases
     her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits
     down beside her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after a long silence)
               Do you know that the first thing
               which separated man from the rest
               of the mammals was his knowledge of
               fire?
                    (he looks at her)
               No, I suppose you don't.
                    (pokes at fire)
               The next great stride came with
               the discovery of the wheel.
                    (turns to her)
               Do you know what that is?
                    (she shakes her head)
               I'm sorry I was angry with your
               people.  I had no right to be.
               No more than if I had visited the
               Island of Bali in my own time.
               You were safe inside your great
               house, yet you came out into the
               night to warn me.  The one
               characteristic which distinguished
               man from the animal kingdom was the
               spirit of self sacrifice.  You have
               that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all
               of your people have it.  All it
               requires is someone to reawaken it.
               I shall try if you'll let me.  Will
               you?

                         WEENA
               I do not understand you, but I
               believe you.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's a good start. - Now try to
               tell me...who or what are the Morlocks?
                    (Weena looks at him blankly)
               Are they people or animals?
                    (her expression remains unchanged)
               What do you know about yourself?  The
               past?  Don't your people ever speak
               of the past?

                         WEENA
               There is no past.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Don't you ever wonder about the future?

                         WEENA
               There is no future.



     ANOTHER ANGLE                                          226

     The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring
     the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with
     compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within
     her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of
     the words.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Man's past is mainly a grim struggle
               for survival, but there have been
               moments when a few voices have spoken
               up.  These rare moments have made the
               history of man a glorious thing.  I
               refuse to believe it is dead and gone.
               We've had our dark ages before and
               this is only another of them.  All
               you need is for someone to show you
               the way out. - I'm only a tinkering
               mechanic, but there must be this
               hidden spark in one of your people.
               If I can only kindle that spark, my
               coming here will have some meaning.

     During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him,
     her cheek touching his knee.  He looks down at her
     and sees he has made a friend.  He places his hand
     gently on her hair.  She looks up, her eyes no
     longer showing fear.  Their faces are illuminated
     by the dancing flames.



     THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT                                  227

     It CRACKLES reassuringly.

                                     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                          228

     The ring of flames from the previous scene is
     seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from
     which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT
     MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.  The
     CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE
     where more wells are visible in the distance,
     each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.  Their
     roofs are shining brass-like disks.

     Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx,
     approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket
     over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               My efforts next morning to open the
               panel were fruitless.  I had to find
               another way to retrieve my Machine.

     Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller
     walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into:



     THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                                 229

     It descends into darkness, but near the top can be
     seen handholds in an irregular pattern.  The
     THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous.



     AT THE MOUTH OF WELL - FULL SHOT                       230

     The Time Traveller in the f.g. turns back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen!
                    (pause)
               Do you hear?

                         WEENA (fearfully)
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Machines!

                         WEENA
               No...Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (straightening, amazed)
               You mean those animals run machines?

                         WEENA
               They are Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (as he walks to her)
               I know, but have you seen the
               machines?



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         231

     She shakes her head.

                         WEENA
               No, only heard of them.

     The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller
     as he reaches her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Who told you?

                         WEENA
               The talking rings.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (moves closer to her)
               What sort of rings?

                         WEENA
                    (with a shrug)
               Rings that talk.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Can you show me these rings?

     Weena nods and starts off.  He follows her.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:



     INT. GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                    232

     Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past
     the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books
     that the Young Man had previously shown him.

     She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone
     corridor.  He follows.



     INT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233

     Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor
     where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear
     around the corner.



     INT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234

     The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of
     a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish
     colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no
     windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent
     dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course
     of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is
     evidently a place that no one bothers to visit.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235

     Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they
     walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still
     existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are
     broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos-
     phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize
     objects and machines, some belonging to the early
     part of the twentieth century and still others take
     on the forms and shapes that the audience of today
     will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass
     cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond
     comprehension.

     Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken
     case which contains several boxes of golden rings
     a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined
     with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the
     nearest box and examines its contents.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (picking up a ring)
               Are these the talking rings?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               They speak?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of what?

                         WEENA
               Things no one here understands.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you get it to talk?

     Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and
     lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its
     edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top.



     INSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236

     A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current
     of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono-
     graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the
     surface of one of our records.

                         VOICE FROM RING
               Whomsoever chances upon these rings
               will probably hear the last recorded
               voice of civilized man.  This is the
               year four thousand eight hundred and
               twenty-nine.



     TWO SHOT                                               237

     The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and
     Weena in disinterested detachment.

                         VOICE FROM RING (cont'd)
               The war between the East and West,
               which is now in its three hundredth
               and twenty-sixth year has at last
               come to an end.  There is nothing
               left to fight with and few of us
               left to fight.  The atmosphere has
               become so polluted with deadly
               germs that it can no longer be
               breathed.  There is no place on
               this planet that is immune.  The
               last surviving factory for the
               manufacture of oxygen has been
               destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly
               diminishing and when they are gone,
               we must die...

     The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY.
     The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for
     the second ring and spins it.

                         ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING
               This is the last day.  We, the last
               to survive, have had our final meeting.
               We have decided to split into two
               groups.  Each man and woman has made
               his own decision.  Some have chosen
               to take refuge in the great caverns
               and find a new way of life far down
               below the earth's surface.  The rest
               of us have decided to take our chances
               in the sunlight, small as those chances
               may be.

     The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no
     more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the
     third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are
     heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over
     floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                238

     As he watches the last ring spin to a standstill.
     Over this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               From the talking rings I learned how
               the human race divided itself and
               how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks
               began.

     He turns.



     GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT                               239

     The Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena
     hurries after him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               By some quirk of fate the Morlocks
               had become the masters and the Eloi
               their servants.  The Morlocks main-
               tained them and bred them like cattle
               only to take them below when they
               reached maturity, which explained why
               there were no older people along them.

     They exit.



     GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240

     The Time Traveller, followed by Weena, walks from
     the book shelves toward the entrance.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Now I knew I must go below.  It was
               the only means of finding a way up
               into the sphinx to reach my Machine
               and to find out what happened to the
               little people when they went below.

     They leave the Great Hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     241

     The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells.
     Weena senses his intention and catches up with him
     to grasp his arm.

                         WEENA
               No...don't go...please.

     He shakes her off.



     AT MOUTH OF WELL - MED. SHOT                           242

     The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall.
     Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead
     of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of
     sight by the current from the shaft.  Then he looks
     around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and
     listens.

     After a PLOP is heard he puts his arm down the
     shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then
     throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts
     to descend.  Weena rushes to his side to stop him.

                         WEENA
               You will not come back.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll be back.

     Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him
     a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his
     pocket.  The Time Traveller smiles as he dis-
     appears.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        243

     Locking from below, the top of the well appears
     like a small blue disk with Weena peering down.
     The Time Traveller gropes his way.

     Suddenly from the far distance comes the SOUND of
     LOW but POWERFUL SIREN.  Weena straightens.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         244

     An expression of fear comes slowly over her face
     as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER
     PITCH.  The Two make a grating dissonance.  Slowly
     she turns in the direction of the sound.



     BACK WITH TIME TRAVELLER                               245

     He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.



     BACK TO WEENA                                          246

     As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two,
     Weena's fear is gone.  In its place is an expres-
     sion of utter resignation.  Like someone in a
     trance she opens her eyes and stares straight
     ahead.  Then, as though she is summoning all her
     strength to go through some ordeal, she starts
     walking away.  The CAMERA PANS and we see the breeze
     ripple her silken robe about her as she moves.

     (NOTE:  During the above and throughout the follow-
             ing sequence the dirge-like WHISTLES
             CONTINUE, ECHOING mournfully.)



     REVERSE SHOT                                           247

     Weena is walking forward and disappears behind the
     trees as the Time Traveller emerges from the well
     in the b.g.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                248

     Looking for Weena.  She is nowhere to be seen.
     His face shows exasperation, bewilderment.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Where are you, Girl?



     WEENA - FULL SHOT                                      249

     She continues to walk toward the source of the
     SIRENS.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           250

     The DIRGE-LIKE MELODY becomes LOUDER, pulsating,
     as he pauses to watch:



     EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                251

     Emerging from the forest are two Eloi, a man and
     a woman.  They are several paces apart and pay no
     attention to one another.  Both have exactly the
     same manner as Weena.  They walk along, eyes
     straight ahead, faces expressionless.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                252

     As he looks ahead, then left and right, searching.



     VARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)                      253-254

     In the open country now, the forest behind them.
     In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly
     across the green landscape.

     All are converging toward a single point somewhere
     ahead.



     WEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255

     They walk close together, paying no attention to one
     another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY
     STRAINS OF THE SIRENS.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 256

     His concern has turned to apprehension as he tries
     to grasp the meaning of what he observes.



     EXT. THE SIRENS ON THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY)      257
     (MINIATURE)

     It is the source of the sound.  There are little
     bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as
     they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe
     organ behind the Sphinx.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258

     All of them walk in the same direction.  The Time
     Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered.
     But the Eloi disregard him and march straight
     ahead, eyes forward.

     The Time Traveller breaks into a run.



     TWO SHOT                                               259

     The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes
     his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass
     the shadows of the marching Eloi.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's happening?  Tell me!

     The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to
     free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical.
     This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at
     him, releasing his grip.

     The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about
     and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re-
     mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING
     SIRENS are now getting on his nerves.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -      260
     (DAY)

     The Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in
     a trance-like state.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261

     From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes
     are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres-
     sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind
     is marching to some unknown doom.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262

     He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind.
     But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases
     her, then goes on again, covering his ears with
     his palms, fighting to retain command of his own
     reason.



     SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)              263-265

     At various angles -- up, sideways, tilted.  The
     WAILING is DEAFENING.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                266

     He still strives to control himself, moves forward,
     then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267

     It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have
     been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the
     Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open,
     revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal.

     And despite their previous repugnance to the
     Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across
     the lawn resolutely to it.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268

     The Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters
     the wide opening and starts descending into sub-
     terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among
     them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               Weena!

     Without hearing him she passes through the entrance.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           269

     He desperately pushes forward, elbowing his way
     past others in his haste to overtake Weena.  The
     crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the
     Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouts in
                    despair)
               Weena!



     THE PANEL                                              270

     Slowly closing and the sound of the SIRENS gradually
     DIES AWAY.  The Time Traveller reaches the panel as
     it shuts tight before he can touch it.  He spreads
     his palms against it in despair, then turns to face
     those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside.  What
     he sees astonishes him.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          271

     They no longer approach the sphinx.  The ceasing of
     the sirens seems to have released them from their
     hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened,
     they are retreating.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 272

     As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones
     and calls out angrily.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Stop!



     BACK TO ELOI                                           273

     Featuring the Man in White in the f.g.  They halt
     and stare back.  The Time Traveller's voice comes
     over like a whip.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               What are you running from?

     None of the Eloi answer.



     TOWARD THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT                          274

     Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in
     the shadow of the white sphinx.  He steps slowly
     forward onto the lawn, looking around the big
     semi-circle of his audience.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply,
                    gesturing back toward the panel)
               Where have they gone?
                    (no answer)
               What happens to them?
                    (no answer)
               Don't stand there like a fatted
               cattle grazing contentedly in lush
               pastures. - Answer me!  What's
               wrong?

                         MAN IN WHITE (calmly)
               There is nothing wrong.  It is all
               clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What do you mean, all clear?

                         MAN IN WHITE (repeating)
               All clear!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (thinking
                    rapidly, talking to himself)
               Once....in the middle nineteen
               hundreds I heard a man...
                    (it bursts upon him)
               The falling bombs!
                    (to the Man in white
                    and the crowd)
               That's over.  Gone.  Dead for
               hundreds of thousand of years.
               There are no more flying machines.
               No bombs.  No wars!

                         MAN IN WHITE
               Yes, the rings have told us that
               story.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED SHOT                              275

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you didn't listen.  You didn't
               learn anything.  All that is left
               is fear...a blind animal fear.
               Ages ago men were taught to hide in
               the ground when the sirens blew...
               taught to run from a raining death...
               but those men are dead!  And so are
               the men who slaughtered them.  Don't
               you understand?
                    (looks around pleadingly)
               You are slaves of a dead past... You
               don't even own your souls.  You're
               led to slaughter like sheep!

                         MAN IN WHITE (o.s.)
               But there is nothing to fear now,
               it's all clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What about those who went below?
               How are they to come back?



     MAN IN WHITE                                           276

     He looks ominously at the Time Traveller.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               They never come back.  Nobody can
               bring them back.

     Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man
     in White following them.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 277

     Calling after them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You can try.  Won't any of you
               even try?

     He sees that the situation is hopeless.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               Well, someone has to try!

     He runs off.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        278

     The Time Traveller running through the forest.         (a)

     He is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b)

     The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c)
     of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller.



     EXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279

     Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his
     breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve
     as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts
     to descend.

     Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be
     heard.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280

     The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls
     with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is
     dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER.



     IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281

     As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker
     it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as
     well.

     Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely
     saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest,
     glancing upward.



     FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282

     A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching
     the Time Traveller's progress.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283

     A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally
     to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost
     complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the
     tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his
     belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers
     ahead.



     INT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1

     The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g.,
     pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then
     starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall.
     The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver-
     ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and
     grotesque shadows.

     (NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF
             MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this
             scene as well as the following sequence.)



     CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2

     Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously
     moves toward:



     INT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3

     At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T.
     pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the
     cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly
     disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight
     that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and
     horror.



     THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4

     This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks.
     In the flickering light we see stone tables and
     scattered around the floor far below the unmistak-
     able remains of human bones after the flesh has been
     carnivorously picked away.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
               So, this was the destiny of the
               Eloi.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5

     His features twisted in horror in the flickering
     light of his match.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               They were being bred like cattle
               by the Morlocks who had degenerated
               into the lowest form of human
               life...cannibalism.

     The match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a
     shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber
     of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale,
     spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g.
     descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise.



     MACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6

     Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their
     mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending
     the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the
     intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then
     hide.



     STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7

     The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway
     that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of
     the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T.
     is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals
     itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock
     appears at the top of the stairs and follows.

     Passing near the T.T.'s hiding place.  Weena and the
     Young Man are side by side.



     AT THE MACHINES                                        283X16

     The Morlocks who followed the T.T. are closing in.



     BACK TO T.T. - MOVING SHOT                             283X17

     He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him.  Hugging
     the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible
     point where he can still remain unobserved by the
     herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention.  He
     reaches out.

                         T.T.
               Weena!

     But she continues on with complete resignation to her
     fate.  Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid-
     ing place and grasps her by the shoulders.

                         T.T.
                    (shaking her)
               Girl!
                    (he turns and grasps the
                    passing Young Man)
               Come to your senses!  All of you!

     As the T.T. pulls Weena toward the staircase, the
     Young Man follows.



     FOOT OF STAIRWAY                                       283X18

     Morlocks block the escape.



     THREE SHOT                                             283X19

     The CAMERA MOVES with the T.T., Weena and the Young
     Man as they are forced to retreat.



     AT ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                           283X20

     Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi
     into the chamber of horrors.

     One of the Morlocks spots the T.T., Weena and the
     Young Man.  He swings his whip.



     BACK TO THREE SHOT                                     283X21

     The CAMERA MOVES with them as vicious CRACKING
     WHIPS drive them back to the entrance of the
     feasting room.



     TWO SHOT                                               283X22

     The T.T. tries to protect Weena.  Suddenly a long
     lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils
     about the T.T.'s neck.  He drops his unlit torch
     and whirls in pain.

     Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of
     horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s
     shoulders.  Finally he grabs the whip from around
     his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free.



     AT THE ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                       283X23

     The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the
     Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from
     above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him,
     knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
     On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles
     away leaving the T.T. a prey to the battery of
     CRACKING WHIPS.  He crawls in pain into the
     chamber of horrors.



     GROUPSHOT INSIDE FEASTING ROOM                         283X24

     The T.T. comes to his feet among the Eloi.  The
     WHIPS HAVE STOPPED, then the silence is broken by
     the GROWL of approaching MORLOCKS.  Through the
     curtains, dark shapes swarm toward them.  Then
     suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his
     pocket.  A match flares!



     GROUP OF MORLOCKS                                      283X25

     In the glare of yellow light we see the leprous
     figures of blinded Morlocks, dropping their whips,
     shielding their eyes.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X26

     The T.T.'s hand with the burning match rapidly zooms
     into the center of the picture in a BLINDING FLASH
     turning the screen momentarily white, then yellow
     and red.  Then the CAMERA MOVES BACK indicating the
     Morlocks' retreat.  Slowly the normal colors
     reappear.



     BACK TO THE GROUP OF MORLOCKS                          283X27

     Regaining their sight in the darkness, they start
     to close in.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X28

     Followed by the Eloi the T.T. exits the feasting
     room and again lights a match.  A BLINDING FLASH
     starting from the flame as a center engulfs the screen,
     momentarily white again, then yellow, finally red.
     Once more the CAMERA RETREATS, then still seeing
     through the Morlocks' eyes the CAMERA ZOOMS CLOSE
     ON THE MATCH BOX and the scaley hand of a Morlock
     slaps all the matches except one to the floor.



     T.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29

     He lights his last match and moves forward, looking
     for his lost torch.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X30

     The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the
     light of the match his only weapon in keeping the
     Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and
     picks it up hurriedly.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31

     His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre-
     hension while he applies the dying match to the
     intended torch.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (muttering)
               Burn, will you!

     He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and
     lower without starting the wood.  In despair he
     turns to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Quick, something to burn!  It's
               my last match!



     BACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32

     As they are closing in.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33

     With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve
     of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds
     it out.



     BACK TO T.T.                                           283X34

     As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the
     cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the
     dead match.

     He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and
     in this hotter flame it begins to burn.  Once it
     starts he again attempts to make his way by blind-
     ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X35

     As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway,
     one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip
     strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand.



     A CORNER                                               283X36

     The torch rolls in and begins to sputter.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          283X37

     The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other
     Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the
     T.T.  As they face one another, the fight begins.



     [PAGE 90 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]



     Eloi below him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Weena, get the torch!



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X5

     Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena
     looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then
     turns searching for the flickering torch.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 351X6

     As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge.
     Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost
     falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs
     on until he can scramble up on ledge again.
     He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his
     head against the rock wall, finally throwing
     him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor-
     lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he
     had previously kicked rises to menace him from
     the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across
     cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor,
     trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon
     against the Morlocks.



     CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7

     He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.  He
     sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently
     too confused to move.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Go on!  Go on the
               steps!



     CLOSE SHOT - AT ROCK - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN             351X8

     Weena spots the still flickering torch and
     starts toward it.



     INSERT OF TORCH                                        351X9

     Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends
     down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock
     appears facing her.  She screams and jumps back,
     watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward
     her.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X10

     The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several
     Morlocks converging on him.  He tries to fight his
     way past them.



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X11

     Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her
     over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting
     Cave.



     MED. SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                             351X12

     JUMPS up on ramp, kicks back at Morlocks - sees
     Morlock carrying Weena - JUMPS through Morlocks
     and runs toward her.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X13

     The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away
     from Morlock, knocks him against rock.  In the
     meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and
     jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down.
     The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps
     on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him.



     CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                            351X14

     Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for
     help.



     CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN                                 351X15

     Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the
     Time Traveller's silent plea for help.  Slowly
     raises his right hand, stares at it as he
     gradually clenches it into a fist.  Then, making
     up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor-
     lock hard on the back of his neck.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X16

     As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller
     kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs
     to get his torch.  Several Morlocks try to herd
     Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the
     Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the
     Eloi resist them.  The Time Traveller runs back
     in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X17

     The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs
     pushing Weena ahead of him.  They climb up past
     Cauldron.  Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi,
     shielding their eyes from the light of the Time
     Traveller's torch.



     CLOSER SHOT                                            351X18

     The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the
     Eloi are all on their way out.  Then turns back
     and drops his torch into the oil flowing into
     the Cauldron.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X19

     The burning torch catches the Cauldron on
     fire, which quickly spreads across the floor
     of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on
     the right, which explodes.  The Time Traveller
     herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X20

     Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of
     burning Cauldron hiding his face from the
     flames.  He bumps into the Pipe coming down
     the wall, loses his balance and falls into
     the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher.



     PAN SHOT                                               351X21

     Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as
     fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine
     at same time as fire - and it explodes.  Morlock
     catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave.



     PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT                                 352

     Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena
     run toward a circle of light on the floor far
     ahead.



     CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE                           353

     Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light
     that comes straight down from above, and look
     up the shaft.  Smoke belches from the passage-
     way as he helps her start up the ladder and
     then he, himself, follows, clambering out of
     sight.



     IN THE WELL                                            354

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller
     climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.  The light
     becomes slowly brighter and he looks up.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        355

     Gradually the top of the well becomes visible
     through the swirling smoke.  The Young Man is
     peering down.  He reaches to help Weena and the
     Time Traveller.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       356

     Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with
     soot, near exhaustion.  Far below them red flames
     pierce through the smoke.  They each in turn grasp
     the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out
     of the well.



     EXT. THE WELL - MED. SHOT - (SUNSET)                   357

     As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the
     Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake
     of approval.

     The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs,
     carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the
     pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn-
     ing wood down in to the well.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       358

     The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites
     the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          359

     The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to
     the other wells.  The Young Man first, then the rest of
     the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches
     from the torch and dash for the various wells to
     duplicate the Time Traveller's action.



     VARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362

     Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of
     wells and dumping the fire below.



     TWO SHOT                                               363

     With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on
     with approval at the Eloi's work.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (SUNSET)                  364

     It is dotted with wells, each of which has been
     turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and
     smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing
     the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the
     surface of the Earth.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   365

     It falls with a CRASH to the ground and begins to
     spew smoke and flame into the undergrowth of the
     forest nearby.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -          366
     (SUNSET)

     Smoke drifts out of its windows.  The Eloi hurry
     out, led by the Man in White.  They stop and stare
     at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed
     below.



     EXT. THE BLAZING FOREST - (SUNSET) - (STOCK)           367-368

     The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through
     the smoke.  Several trees fall over, blazing.  LOW
     UNDERGROUND RUMBLING is heard.



     WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELLER                           369

     They start down the hill after the Eloi, seeking
     safety together.  Suddenly a DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE
     EARTH makes them pause and look o.s.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DUSK) - (MINIATURE)      370

     Then comes a SERIES OF TREMBLORS, each more powerful
     than the one before.  The earth shudders and the
     blazing forest begins to collapse.  It does
     not explode into the air.  Rather, the solid
     earth seems to give way so that the entire
     surface of the ground begins to fall into the
     subterranean chambers.



     ANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)                            371

     A section of the earth sheers away and falls
     in an ever widening rift.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   372

     As it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a
     belch of steam.



     BACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)                        373

     Leveled off by the earthquake.  There are no more
     flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or
     obelisks.  There is no movement -- only the
     flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by
     the gentle breeze.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          374

     Staring into the vast destruction.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                               375

     He holds her hand.  The CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY and
     we begin to hear the

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                 (calmly)
             The underworld of the Morlocks was
             gone...and so was the life of leisure
             for the Eloi.

     He looks o.s.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          376

     The Man in White, with others, approaches the group
     headed by the Young Man.  The two men look at each
     other, their gestures and expressions showing their
     joy at release from centuries of fear.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             From now on they would have to work
             to survive.  And looking at their
             faces, I somehow knew that they could
             start over again.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                       377

     He looks down to Weena and we HEAR:

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             Another night was coming, but this
             night no Eloi needed to fear.

     The CAMERA MOVES CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER who looks
     up in concern.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             But what of me? - I was imprisoned
             in a world in which I did not belong.

                                  DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                    378

     This is the same pool where the Time Traveller
     saved Weena's life.  The peaceful SOUND of the
     RUSHING STREAM is occasionally interrupted by a
     REMOTE RUMBLE of EXPLOSION from the earth below.

     There is no sign in the sky of old constellations,
     only the face of the full moon looks familiar.
     The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket,
     relaxes on the white sand, playing with the
     blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and
     WHISTLING "The Land Of The Leal".

     Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of
     the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands.
     She glances over to the Time Traveller.

                      WEENA
             Are you sorry?

     He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES.
     He turns.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Sorry? - Sorry for what?

                      WEENA
             That you have to stay.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (gazing into the night)
             Yes. - I am sorry because I could
             tell so much to the people of my
             own time... I could tell them about
             the happiness and sorrow the future
             has in store for them.  They could
             learn from it...or would they?

                      WEENA
             You don't want to stay, do you?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             It isn't that, but I don't fit here
             anymore than you would in my time.

                      WEENA
                 (a pause, and then)
             I would like to see your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, Girl, you wouldn't be very
             happy there.

                      WEENA
             Do you have someone like me -
             there?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No.  No one like you.  But there
             are friends who will miss me. - As
             a matter of fact, I'm probably late
             already.

                      WEENA
                 (stealing a glance,
                 then quietly)
             Women?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, men.
                 (teasing)
             There is a woman too, of course!
                 (noticing her disappointment,
                 he relents)
             She looks after my house for me.
             She is sixty-two years old. - Much
             older than you are.

     Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair
     into a new arrangement.

                      WEENA
                 (suddenly)
             How do they wear their hair?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Who?

                      WEENA
             The women in your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (after a thought)
             Up!

                      WEENA
             Up? - How?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (with awkward gesture)
             Like this.

                      WEENA
             Show me.

     The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his
     pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.



     WEENA - MED. SHOT                                      379

     The Time Traveller appears behind her.  He first
     hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair
     imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.  She
     smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face
     toward him.

                      WEENA
                 (innocently)
             Would I be pretty?

     The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his.
     He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes
     into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on
     his cheek.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (slowly)
             Yes...you would be.  More than
             pretty.
                 (his voice sinks to a whisper)
             I wish we could go back together,
             Weena, back to my own time...or to
             times before that when the world
             was young.  We could...

     EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.  They
     both look in the direction of the voices.



     EXT. HILL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)              380

     A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man
     in White, approach them, talking excitedly,
     pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just
     revealed by the rolling smoke.  The face is
     broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The
     panel is open.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381

     Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her,
     breaks into a run.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          382

     The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The
     Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze,
     then the Eloi follow them.



     EXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383
     (MATTE)

     The face is broken in half.  It is left with only
     a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the
     remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the
     sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins
     of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and
     gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time
     Traveller and Weena come through the charred
     bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop.



     THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384

     The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling
     smoke.  The flames, licking at the inside walls,
     have not yet reached the Machine.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT                     385

     He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket
     and bring forth the lever without which the Machine
     will not function.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (without
                    looking at her)
               Come, Girl!

     He walk, toward the panel.  Weena follow,
     hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to
     halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this,
     the Time Traveller enters.



     INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386

     Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time
     Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes
     in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands
     on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her
     radiant features.

     Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around
     as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and
     starts to fit the lever into place.



     REVERSE ANGLE                                          387

     The Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow
     starts sliding across his figure, moving more
     swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes
     with a CLANG.



     OUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388

     Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them
     and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.



     INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389

     The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles
     to open them.  From without he hears Weena's
     POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living
     presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is
     silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking,
     weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some-
     thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls
     around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the
     enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding
     them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into
     the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as
     he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and
     try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and
     smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling
     bodies.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390

     The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and
     finally grasps it.

     Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls
     over the instruments, followed by a burst of
     whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
     There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total
     darkness.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             405

     Passing back in time through his captivity beneath
     the lava.  He reels in the saddle, then coming
     from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.
     As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the
     daylight returns, we can see that his face is
     covered with perspiration.  He looks off to see:



     SERIES OF SHOTS - (ANIMATION, MINIATURE, SPLIT)        406

     (NOTE:  These shots seen previously are now printed
             backward.)

             The red hot lava withdraws through the         (a,b,c)
             street ruins and the great rents in the
             ground gulp it up quickly.  Out of the
             ruins building are molded and then
             atomic explosions in reverse flash
             across the screen.  The SOUND OF
             EXPLOSIONS, RUMBLING ETC.  IN REVERSE
             AND SPEEDED UP join the HUMMING of the
             Time Machine.

             slowing.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 407

     INTERCUT his reaction to the previous scenes until
     he straightens and readjusts the lever.  The
     HUMMING DECREASES, then walls rise about him.
     Watching the dials, he carefully moves the lever.
     The flickers of the days and nights decelerate
     and, with a sudden pull, he halts the Time Machine.
     The HUMMING ABRUPTLY CEASES.



     INSERT:  DIAL                                          408

     It stops on:  "5 January 1900".



     INT. LABORATORY - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                  409

     The Time Machine has returned, but it is resting
     in the far corner of the room instead of in the
     spot where we originally saw it.

     In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain-
     fully from the Machine.  Then, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA,
     he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it.
     His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest
     on the clock.  It is "8:04".

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     PENDULUM CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                            410

     Now showing "9:22".  For a long while only its
     MONOTONOUS TICKING is heard. - A welcome change
     from the cacophony of time traveling.

     The CAMERA MOVES slowly to reveal the DINING ROOM
     where the five men, their meal finished, are
     sitting silently around the table.  Mrs. Watchett
     is quietly serving the liqueur.  The Time Traveller
     is puffing on his pipe.  Kemp is chewing on his
     cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation.

                         DR. HILLYER
               It is ridiculous!  Simply preposterous!

     Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly
     with the spoon which CLINKS loudly in the room's
     silence.  Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp
     from his brandy.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well, there's one thing I'll say
               for you, George.  You always could
               tell a good story.  Best adventure
               yarn I've heard for years.
                    (loudly)
               You're a truly fine inventor,
               George!

     He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a
     hiccup quickly puts a period to that.  Mrs. Watchett
     steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of
     brandy.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I'll turn down your bed for you!

     As she exits Kemp looks up.

                         KEMP
               Truthfully, where have you been
               for the past week?

     Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL
                    (voice of experience)
               Now, we shouldn't ask such questions,
               Walter.  It's not hard for a man to
               lose a week now and then.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling)
               I understand your doubt.  Take it
               as a lie if you wish.  Now that
               I'm back I scarcely believe it
               myself.
                    (a flash of memory)
               Except that...
                    (groping in pocket)
               ...here are the flowers Weena gave
               me.

     He places the blossoms on the table before Filby.
     They are actually less than a day old and fairly
     fresh.



     FILBY AND THE BLOSSOMS - CLOSE SHOT                    411

     As he picks them up to examine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               A present for you, David.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             412

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to Filby)
               You were always interested in
               botany. - Try to match them with
               any species known today.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          413

     As he looks up, puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I don't think I can.



     GROUP SHOT                                             414

     A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on
     the table, stands up, looks around and then down
     to Kemp.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Are you coming, Kemp.

     Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller.

                         KEMP
               It's getting late and you look
               exhausted.  You had better get
               some rest.

     Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and
     starts to leave.



     COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415

     The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down
     from the sky.  The front door opens letting out
     the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.
     They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping
     the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to
     leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage
     looking back to the Time Traveller who stands
     motionless in the doorway.

                         FILBY
               Goodnight, George.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416

     The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thank you, David, for being such
               a good friend - always.

     With this he turns and goes into the house, closing
     the door slowly.



     AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417

     Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,
     but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.
     Kemp thrusts his head from the window.

                         KEMP
               What do you think, Filby?

                         FILBY (after a pause)
               One thing is certain.  Those
               flowers couldn't have possibly
               bloomed in the winter-time.

                         HILLYER (in the b.g.)
               You don't really think that story
               was true?

     Filby reaches a decision.

                         FILBY
               Look, you chaps go on.  It's
               just a short walk home for me.

                         HILLYER (o.s.)
               Go on, driver!

     The WHIP CRACKS.



     THE DRIVEWAY                                           418

     As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing
     in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage
     disappears, then retraces his steps to the front
     door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then
     uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer.
     He steps back and looks off toward the:



     EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419

     No light shines through its windows.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          420

     He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the
     door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house.



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421

     The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters
     the fully lit room, looking for his friend.
     Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES
     ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at
     the doorway.



     DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422

     The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The
     pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is
     "9:30".



     FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423

     He calls into the darkness.

                         FILBY
               George!...

     No answer.  Then an odd HUMMING sound brings
     him to stiff attention.  The SOUND INCREASES in
     VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems
     to tremble.  Then a violent gust of wind blows
     open the door that leads to the laboratory.

     Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the
     corridor.



     AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                  424

     Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives
     and tries the door -- it is locked.  The NOISE
     is almost DEAFENING.  He puts his shoulder to
     the door and finally bursts it open.  At the
     very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly.
     He stops short, gazing aghast.



     THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.                        425

     The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING,
     leaving the present.

     Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the
     corner where we last saw the Time Machine.  It is
     not there!  The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner.
     Nor is it there!  A few sheets of paper whirl
     desolately in the center of the floor.



     CLOSE ON FILBY                                         426

     He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
     behind him.  Mrs. Watchett hurries in.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervous,
                    breathless)
               Oh, Mr. Filby...what...
                    (her eyes widen)

                         FILBY (with finality)
               He's gone!

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly
     approaches the center of the room.  Here, with
     squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the
     floor.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (to
                    Filby)
               There's something funny here, sir!

     Filby steps aside her to investigate.



     WHAT THEY SEE                                          427

     The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling
     the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the
     front of the sphinx.  They are scratched deep in
     the floor leading from the spot where the Machine
     was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory
     where it originally stood.  Here, not only its
     imprint, but also the color and finish of the
     floor is preserved.



     TWO SHOT                                               428

     They straighten.  Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby,
     puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I think I understand. - Look!



     LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                                 429

     Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint
     in the floor where the Machine first stood and
     explains.

                         FILEY (pointing)
               See the imprint?  This is where
               the Time Machine originally
               stood.
                    (he paces across to the
                    end of the grooves)
               But the Morlocks moved it.
               They dragged it across the lawn
               right into the sphinx...right
               here.
                    (turns and points)
               And Weena was standing there when
               he last saw her...the same space -
               in a different time. - So he moved
               back his heavy Machine from here,
               across the room, scratching this
               floor...
                    (indicating the grooves
                    that lead to the imprint)
               So that he can appear outside the
               sphinx again and help the Eloi
               build a new world...and build a
               new world of his own.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (faintly,
                    sentimentally)
               Where he left her!..

     Filby doesn't answer.  He looks about the labora-
     tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's
     arm and leads her from the room.  The MUSIC STARTS
     THE THEME:  "The Land Of The Leal".



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               430

     Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room.

                         FILBY
               But it isn't like George. - To
               return empty handed.  To try to
               rebuild a civilization without
               a plan.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               He must have taken something
               with him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing.

     She looks around and discovers three empty spaces
     on the tightly packed book shelves.  She walks to
     them.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing except three books.

                         FILBY
               Which three books?

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I don't know. -- Is it important?

                         FILBY (smiles)
               No, I suppose not. - Only...what
               three books would you have taken?

     She looks at him, pondering the question as they
     leave the library.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL                                     431

     They stop at the door and Mrs. Watchett stands
     beside Filby as he opens it.  Outside the snow
     is falling softly.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Mr. Filby, do you think he will
               ever return?

                         FILBY (quietly)
               One cannot choose but wonder. -
               You see...he has all the time in
               the world!

     With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls
     the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into
     the night.  Mrs. Watchett looks after him.  She
     hears the SOUND of his DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS
     SQUEAKING in the virgin snow.  Slowly she closes
     the door.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)           432

     Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly
     as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses
     a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a
     path and starts walking the long way home.

                                            SLOW FADE OUT.

     GLIDING OBJECTS IN A WIDE DARK VOID - (ANIMATION)

             Out of the SILENT darkness a short white       A
             fluted column surmounted by a SUNDIAL
             appears.  It floats in, waveringly, until
             it becomes clearly visible, then drifts
             off as though moving in some huge orbit.

             Next an HOURGLASS floats in from the left      B
             of the screen.  The faint HISSING OF
             RUNNING SAND breaks the stillness of space.

             As the hourglass glides across the screen,     C
             it is met by a GREEK WATER CLOCK accompanied
             by the sound OF DRIPPING WATER.

             A MEDIEVAL CLOCK with weights arises as its    D
             horizontal escapement TICKS LOUDLY.  Mean-
             while the sundial, hourglass and water clock
             return, drifting at diverse angles across
             the screen.

     THE SOUND of the various devices continues to MOUNT.

             A FIGURE wheels past, with the face of a       E
             clock and the body carved like a drummer
             of the 14th century, BEATING the hour.

             A SMALL CLOCK bears a golden angel with        F
             hammer in hands as it STRIKES A BELL.

             ANOTHER TIMEPIECE, with CHIMES, floats in      G
             to mingle with all the drifting objects.

             The BIG BEN is TOLLING                         H

             Then a GREAT BELL.                             J

     DEAFENING SOUNDS NOW COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, as the time K
     devices weave across the screen and, reaching CRESCENDO,
     STOP abruptly.  A mellow VOICE begins to SING THE THEME of L
     the picture, "The Land Of The Leal".  Simultaneously, the
     screen reveals the MAIN TITLE:                             M

                             H. G. Wells'

                           THE TIME MACHINE

                        "THE LAND OF THE LEAL"

                      Words & Music by Peggy Lee

         When I was a wee lad                               L
         And dark was the night
         Afraid I would be
         Til the bright morning light
         And sometimes...for comfort
         Away I would steal Away
         I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And soon I would be there
         It took me no time
         My heart would be soaring
         As I made the climb
         And there was the green grass
         So cool and so sweet
         So good to be run through
         With happy bare feet!

         And who was my teacher
         And how did I know?
         Just when to be going
         And which way to go?
         But always when wishing
         Away I would steal
         Away I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And now that I'm older
         I try to be wise
         But when I am troubled
         I still close my eyes
         And just like the wee lad
         Away I will steal
         Away I will go to the Land of the Leal.

         For there are no questions
         And there are no lies
         And never a storm there
         To darken the skies
         The birds who are flying
         No freer they feel
         Than I
         When I live in the land of the Leal.

     After the CREDIT TITLES, the MUSIC SUBSIDES and we slowly

                                                 FADE OUT:



     FADE IN:                                               1
     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)

     Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading
     over the snow-patched countryside.  Only the
     laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded
     from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.
     A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of
     the century, lingers in the driveway.  Beyond all
     this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.

     A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and
     KNOCKS on it impatiently.



     AT THE DOOR                                            2

     The knock is answered by MRS. WATCHETT, the house-
     keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair.
     The CAMERA ENTERS the HALL with DAVID FILBY, an
     amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily
     hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes
     toward:



     INT. LIBRARY                                           3

     A pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked
     tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient
     Vintage.

     Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless,
     obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the
     two empty chairs.  The silence is accentuated by the
     merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the
     capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about
     the room.

     Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly
     takes his chair.



     SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS                                  4

               DR. PHILIP HILLYER is an imposing            (a)
               businessman, wearing full sideburns.
               He stares stonily at the last empty
               chair, then at Filby with annoyance.

               ANTHONY BRIDEWELL, a man of the world,       (b)
               impeccably attired in the latest fashion,
               welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by
               lifting his glass of whiskey.

               WALTER KEMP, a middle aged man with keen     (c)
               black piercing eyes, angrily chews on
               his Havana.

               Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     (d)
               as

               Hillyer glances impatiently at his           (e)
               watch, comparing time with a GRAND-
               FATHER CLOCK behind him, then snaps
               it shut and glares at:



     EMPTY CHAIR - MED. SHOT                                5

     Conspicuously unoccupied.



     GRANDFATHER CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                         6

     Reaching the hour of eight, it begins to STRIKE ITS
     YELLOW CHIMES.  Other timepieces JOIN IN the announce-
     ment.



     GROUPSHOT                                              7

     The men look at each other until the CHIMES, BELLS
     ETC. FADE away.  Dr. Hillyer angrily slaps on the
     arm of his leather chair.

                         DR. HILLYER
               I say, this is outright rude of the man!

                         FILBEY
               He's undoubtedly been detained.  That's
               all.

     Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-
     thing but is interrupted by

                         KEMP (unscrews the cigar from
                    his tight lips)
               This is such a confounded waste of
               time!  If he's not coming, I've any
               number of more important things to do.

     All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the
     door quietly behind her.  With an envelope in her
     hand she stands there, hesitating.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Speak up -- what is it, woman?

     She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over
     to Filby and hands him the open envelope.  He
     takes his time in extracting the note.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well...are we or are we not invited
               to dinner?

                         FILBY (reading)
               Apparently we are.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               How long has he been gone?

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervously)
               I can't rightly say, sir. - Several
               days...I hardly catch a glimpse of
               him lately.  He never leaves the
               laboratory and comes out only to
               nibble at his meals...but he did tell
               me days ago about dinner tonight and
               left these instructions.
                    (pointing to note)

                         FILBY
               Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

     A faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and
     with that she retreats toward the door.

                         DR. HILLYER (indicating the
                    note)
               What does it say, Filby?  What's
               wrong?

                         FILBY
               Nothing really. - George merely says
               that if he is not here by eight we're
               to begin without him.

     Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it
     hurriedly.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door
     open and turns around.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Dinner is served, gentlemen!

                         BRIDEWELL (puts his glass
                    down)
               First sensible thing I've heard all
               evening.

     He rises and starts for the dining room.  The others
     follow.



     FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8

     As they walk toward the DINING ROOM.

                         FILBY
               This is peculiar.  He is usually very
               prompt, precise and punctual.

                         DR. HILLYER
               He's making fools of us by inviting
               us here and then not showing up.
               It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

                         KEMP
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

                         DR. HILLYER (agreeing)
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

     Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining
     table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the
     others settle down.  This time the chair at the head
     of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.

                         BRIDWELL (arises, lifting
                    his glass)
               One thing I will say for George, he
               keeps the best cellar in the south of
               England...and Mrs. Watchett is the
               finest cook in the world. - I think
               I'll drink to that!

     The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at
     the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.
     All look in the direction of another door across
     the room.



     THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9

     It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,
     dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
     The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the
     men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm,
     she points toward the long corridor now revealed by
     the open door.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)
               There!...there...

     All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife
     clasped in his hand.



     CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10

     We see the figure of a man approaching, a black
     silhouette against the pale glow at the end of
     the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and
     sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes
     closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,
     but as he nears the doorway, the light from the
     room strikes first his legs, then his body and
     finally his face.  Here he stops.

     This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER
     (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At
     this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing
     is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and
     scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For
     a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light
     and then takes another swaying step into the room.



     FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11

     They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass
     of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down
     before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.

                         FILBY
               Good lord! - What's happened?

     Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.
     Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer
     back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however,
     moves forward under his own power.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm all right...just some food...a
               drink...

     He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With
     trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass
     of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.
     The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?

     A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time
     Traveller empties his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL (a delayed
                    answer)
               Of course.  I'm...all right...

     Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller
     like a mother hen.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (half
                    apology, half concern)
               I didn't recognize you!...it was
               so dark...

     The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup
     for him, but he pushes it away.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Meat...I'm hungry for meat!

     Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr.
     Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge
     portion of beef and loads it onto his plate.



     GROUPSHOT                                              12

     The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him
     curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, can't you speak, man?  What
               happened to you?  Aren't you going
               to tell us...

                         BRIDEWELL
               Leave him alone, can't you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (swallowing)
               It's all right. - I want to tell.

                         FILBY
               It will keep, George.  Eat, rest a
               little.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  I must tell it now... while I
               still remember.

                         FILBY
               Relax, try to relax a bit.  You've
               all the time in the world.



     CLOSE ON THE TIME TRAVELLER                            13

     As he looks up, amused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're right, David.
                    (almost to himself)
               That's exactly what I have. -
               All the time in the world!...
               ever since we were all together
               five days ago, the last day of
               Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.

     Slowly the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER while everyone
     listens so intensely that, aside from the Time
     Traveller's VOICE, only the TICKING of a pendulum
     CLOCK is heard.

                                         SLOWLY DISSOLVE:



     INT. - EBONY BOX ON TABLE - CLOSE SHOT (AFTERNOON)     14

     (NOTE:  The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot
             should give the effect of the Ebony Box
             emerging from the Time Traveller's brain.)

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               There in that box rests the result
               of two years' labor.

     The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal the LIBRARY.  The Time
     Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe,
     sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box.
     Across from him in another chair sits Dr. Hillyer
     puffing his cigar.  Bridewell and Filby have glasses
     in their hands -- Kemp nothing.  All are looking at
     the box.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (continues)
               I wanted to finish the job before
               the new century began. - I barely
               made it.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Marvelous.

                         DR. HILLYER (stands up)
               What is it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, it has to do with time.

                         DR. HILLYER
                    (steps to box)
               I've always maintained what this
               nation needs is a reliable timepiece.
               The Navy needs one. The Army needs
               one. - For the artillery you know.

                         KEMP (leaning forward)
               Couldn't do better, George.  So
               that's why you've been in hiding. -
               Clever of you, indeed!

                         FILBY (studying the Time
                    Traveller's reaction)
               I don't believe George is referring
               to a new kind of timepiece.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               When I speak of time, I'm referring
               to the fourth dimension.

     A perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face.
     Dr. Hillyer registers concern.  Kemp looks troubled.
     Only Filby expresses avid interest.

                         FILBY
               Go on, George.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now, as you know, the difficulty
               in explaining the fourth dimension
               is that it cannot be seen or felt -
               it must be thought of.

                         FILBY
               If you don't mind, George, would
               you refresh me on the first three
               dimensions.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Really, Filby, they must have
               taught you something at school!

                         BRIDEWELL (baiting
                    Dr. Hillyer)
               Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Certainly!
                    (he demonstrates
                     pompously)
               When I move in a straight line,
               forward or backward, that's one
               dimension. - When I move to the
               left or right, two dimensions. -
               When I move up and down, three
               dimensions.
                    (a bright idea lights up
                    his face.  At last he can
                    get ahold of the box, but
                    Filby interferes before
                    Dr. Hillyer can get his
                    fingers on it and he has
                    to be satisfied with merely
                    pointing)
               For instance, this box has three
               dimensions:  length, breadth, and
               height.

                         BRIDEWELL (amazed)
               Well, then, what's the fourth
               dimension?

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, that's...that's mere theory!
               No one can really say what the
               fourth dimension is or even that
               it exists.

     Leaning forward in his chair.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               On the contrary, Doctor!  The
               fourth dimension is as true and as
               real a dimension as any of the
               other three.  In fact, they couldn't
               exist without it.

                         DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT)
               How do you mean?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, take that box.  It has the
               first three dimensions, as you said.
               But what if it didn't exist in Time?
               It wouldn't exist at all, would it?

                         DR. HILLYER
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               So - for an object to exist at all,
               it must exist in the fourth dimen-
               sion....and that fourth dimension
               is duration....Time!

                         DR. HILLYER (impatiently)
               All right!  But what's in that box?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm coming to that.  But first,
               consider!  Why is it that we usually
               ignore the fourth dimension?  Because
               we have no freedom to move in it.  We
               can move in the other three -- up,
               down, forward, backward, sideways.
               But when it comes to Time, we are
               prisoners.  Do you follow me, Anthony?

     In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a
     glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.

                         KEMP
               George!  You've given a most lucid
               explanation and all that!  But I
               don't think I entirely understand.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Look!  There are a lot of things in
               the world you don't understand,
               aren't there?

                         KEMP
               Of course!  Quite a number.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you don't refuse to believe
               in them because of that?

                         KEMP
               Not if I can see the proof with
               my own eyes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Good!  All I'm asking you to do
               now is to witness a demonstration
               of the possibility of movement in
               the fourth dimension.
                    (to Dr. Hillyer)
               Philip, will you please hand me
               that box?

     All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to
     the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness,
     and takes it to the Time Traveller.  George opens it
     with great care and brings forth a mechanical device

               I've told you.  The larger model
               can carry a passenger on a journey
               through Time. - Not through Space,
               mind you, but through Time.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Oh, I say George!  If you start
               floating around in the future, aren't
               you likely to mess things up for the
               rest of us?

                         DR. HILLYER
               The future is already there.  It's
               irrevocable and cannot be changed.

     He answers thoughtfully.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's the most important question
               to which I hope to find an answer.
               Can Man control his destiny?  Can he
               change the shape of things to come?

               Imagine that this cigar is the Time
               Traveller.  Now, this lever in front
               of him controls movement.  Forward
               pressure sends the Machine into the
               future, backward pressure into the
               past.  And the harder the pressure
               the faster the Machine travels.

     All eyebrows are raised.

               This experiment can be performed
               only once.  If it succeeds, I lose
               my model forever.  That is why I
               need witnesses.

     They look at each other, uncertain whether he is
     joking or not.  Bridewell stoops with difficulty to
     examine the table.

                         KEMP
               Go ahead.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're ready then?

     Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts
     his finger on the lever.  Then he pauses.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doctor Hillyer, would you care
               to lend me your hand?

     Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling
     weakly.

     presses the lever forward.  A LOW-PITCHED HUM is

     The sudden silence is almost unbearable.  They
     stare at the empty table.  The CAMERA PANS.

                         DR. HILLYER (touches his
                    cigar pocket)
               I'll be damned!

                    to himself)
               It worked!

     Filby swallows.

     Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table.
     Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand
     and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of
     reach as he can.  Then, suddenly reversing his
     decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down.

     Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Where did it go?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (recovering)
               Go?  Nowhere in the usual sense.
               It's still here.
                    (indicating space where the
                    Machine stood)
               But it's no longer in the present.
               It's traveling through time - to
               the future, to be precise.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Do you seriously expect us to
               believe that?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Certainly.

                         DR. HILLYER
               But you just said it hasn't
               really moved.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's correct.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Then why can't we see it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because we're in this room on
               December 31st, 1899, while the
               model you saw is perhaps a hundred
               years away.  This room, or even
               this house, may no longer exist a
               hundred years from now.  But the
               Time Machine is occupying the same
               space it did a moment before it went
               off on its journey.

     Dr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table.

                         DR. HILLYER (exasperated)
               If it occupies the same space, I
               should be able to feel it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must remember that the space
               you've just put your hand through
               is today's space.  You can't put
               your hand into the space of
               tomorrow.

                         DR. HILLYER (getting angry)
               Space is space!  It doesn't change!
               The same space that is here now should
               be here a hundred or even a thousand
               years from now.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  Time changes space.  This flat
               ground we're standing on now could
               have been at the bottom of the sea
               a million years ago.  And a million
               years from now it could be the
               interior of a huge mountain.

     Dr. Hillyer turns away, speechless.

     Kemp steps forward.

               Suppose what you say is true.
               Exactly what do you suggest we do
               with such a contraption?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               For my part, I intend to take a
               journey into the future. - Unless
               someone else prefers to volunteer.

     There is no response.

                         BRIDEWELL (chuckling)
               I say, George.  Suppose you go off
               and get lost in the fiftieth century!
               How will you find your way back?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (quite
                    serious)
               That's a calculated risk I'm prepared
               to take.

     Dr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges
     significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an
     air of reasonableness.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now listen, George!  I don't
               know what you take us for, but
               we're not fools.  There are a
               number of ways of doing a
               disappearing trick!  But a man of
               your ability should not bother
               with such nonsense.

                    resist the temptation for
                    sarcasm)
               There's a war on, you know!  The
               Boers are putting up a pretty stiff
               fight in South Africa and our

               I can put you in touch with the
               War Office if you wish.

     He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting
     near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box
     with its lid open.  Filby is in the b.g.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (looks
                    up at Filby)

               I think Dr. Hillyer has a point,
               George.

     Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the
     Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.  He looks up
     and nods.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now you're being sensible.  I'll
               take care of it first thing in

     Dr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.  Bridewell
     lingers at the table where the model of the Time
     Machine disappeared.

                         BRIDEWELL (concerned)

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of course, I am.

                         DR. HILLYER'S VOICE
               Coming, Bridewell?

     Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed
     by the Time Traveller.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - FULL SHOT                         35

     While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs,
     gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather
     outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and
     grasps the handle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thanks for coming.

     He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell
     at the rear.

                         AD LIBS
               Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George -
               Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.

     Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder,
     reassuringly.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (DUSK) - (MATTE)            36

     In contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow-
     less wintery day.  The visitors are boarding the
     carriage that awaits them in the drive.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Come on, Bridewell.

     Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then
     submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage
     moves off.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT                              37

     The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door-
     way, waves to them.



     THE CARRIAGE                                           38

     As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving.  From
     the opposite direction another carriage full of NOISY
     YOUNG PEOPLE THUNDERS by.  In early New Year's Eve
     REVELRY they TOOT their toy HORNS at the Time Traveller.



     BACK TO THE TIME TRAVELLER                             39

     Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the
     cottage.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - MED SHOT                          40

     The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his
     back against it, staring into space.  Thinking. - He
     spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by
     one of his guests, and picks it up.



     INSERT: NEWSPAPER                                      40-A

     A ROLL OF DRUMS in military fashion ACCENTS the headline
     that the Boer Army has won another victory.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                40-B

     He closes his eyes and, added to the DRUMS, we HEAR
     the call to battle by a DISTANT BUGLE.  Then more
     BRASS, FIFES and HORNS join the BUGLE and DRUMS to take
     up a MILITANT OVERTURE.

     He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution
     strides toward:



     OMITTED                                                41-56



     INT. LIBRARY - LONG SHOT                               57

     The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in
     the f.g.  He stands there and even in the darkness
     WE CAN OBSERVE that he is an angry man.  He strikes
     a match and lights the overhead gas fixture.  The
     light comes up and the MUSIC STOPS as he stares
     across the room to see:



     FILBY - MED. SHOT                                      58

     sitting in a chair near the fireplace.

                         FILBY
               I thought I'd better stay.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               You needn't have troubled yourself.
               I'm all right.

                         FILBY
               No you're not. - You've been
               behaving oddly for over a month
               now.
                    (and then)
               I'm not leaving until you tell me
               what's on your mind.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             59

     Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs
     the coals.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I appreciate your gesture, David,
               but if you don't mind I'd rather
               you left me alone.

                         FILBY
               You have changed, George.
               Enormously.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm sorry.

                         FILBY (looks up to him
                    directly)
               Will you answer me one question
               honestly?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll try.

                         FILBY
               Why this preoccupation with Time?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply)
               Why not?

                         FILBY
               Don't go simple on me, George!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (a beat,
                    then calmly)
               If you want to know the truth, I
               don't much care for the time I was
               born into. - It seems people aren't
               dying fast enough these days.  They
               call upon science to invent new,
               more efficient weapons to depopulate
               the earth.

                         FILBY
               I quite agree with you.  But here
               we are and we have to make the best
               of it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You may have to.  I don't.

                         FILBY (making a half-
                    hearted attempt at levity)
               All right.  Take a journey on your
               contraption.  What would you become?...
               A Greek?  A Roman?  One of the
               Pharaohs?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I prefer the future.

                         FILBY
               You're not seriously saying you can
               do it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You saw the experiment this afternoon,
               didn't you?

                         FILBY
               I saw a toy machine vanish.  But
               I'm certain there are a number of
               ways of doing that trick.  Any
               magician at the Hippodrome could
               probably do it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (angrily)
               It was no trick! - Would you care
               to see the full-scale model?

                         FILBY
               No, I would not!  I have no desire
               to tempt the laws of Providence and
               I don't think you should.  It's not
               for man to trifle with.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.

                         FILBY
               There is something in their common
               sense attitude to life.
                    (and then)
               George, I speak to you as a friend.
               More, as a brother.  If that machine
               can do what you say it can...destroy
               it.  Destroy it, George, before it
               destroys you.

     Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must have plans for New Year's
               Eve.  Don't let me keep you.

                         FILBY
               Mary isn't well.  We decided to
               stay home with the baby.  But why
               don't you come home with me.  You
               haven't seen little Jaime for a
               long time.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I can't.

                         FILBY
               What's stopping you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I just want to see the old century
               out by myself.

                         FILBY (rising)
               Have it your own way.

     He goes to the door.



     AT THE DOOR                                            60

     Filby stops, then turns around.

                         FILBY
               Will you promise me that you won't
               leave the house tonight?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I promise you, I won't walk out of
               the door.

     Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns
     to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and
     steps up to him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               David!  Please don't think me un-
               friendly! - Come over to dinner -
               next Friday.  Won't you?

                         FILBY
               Very well.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Fine...and will you bring the others
               with you?

                         FILBY (with a warm smile)
               Whatever you say, George. - Happy
               New Year.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands)
               And a very happy New Year to you, David.

     Filby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller
     stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then,
     FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table
     and sits down.



     AT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61

     The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the
     new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century."
     He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots
     down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett,
     with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears
     in the doorway and walks up to him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Will you be having supper in this
               evening, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while ex-
                    changing jackets with Mrs.
                    Watchett's help)
               I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why
               don't you take the evening off and
               celebrate.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Thank you, sir, but if you won't be
               needing me I think I'll turn in early
               and get some sleep...
                    (indicating revelers outside)
               ...it I can. - Goodnight, sir.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Goodnight.

     She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Oh, Mrs. Watchett!
                    (as she responds)
               I've invited Mr. Filby and the others
               to dinner next Friday.
                    (and then)
               Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Happy New Year, sir.

     Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once
     again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the
     old calendar that reads:  "December 3l. 1899," rips
     the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight
     little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it
     burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces
     the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily
     scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and
     places it prominently on the table.  He rises and
     mounts the steps that lead to:



     INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62

     The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door
     at the end of the passageway.  Here he pauses momentarily,
     removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then
     slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of
     the picture.



     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                  63

     The laboratory has the appearance of having once been
     a greenhouse.  Only a few potted plants remain.  The
     glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by
     rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight
     is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-
     ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving
     the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov-
     ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps
     through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets
     of drawings and scientific instruments situated around
     the perimeter.

     But the most conspicuous object in the room is the
     Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model
     already seen.

     However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel,
     ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While
     the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the
     full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering
     moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the
     power of movement.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  64

     Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-
     manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,
     then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.  Here
     a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.
     The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the
     crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it
     sparkles like a fine cut diamond.  As he works, his
     lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy
     strains of "The Land Of The Leal."  A clock near him on
     the workbench reads:  "9:30."

     Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming
     handle and crosses to the Machine.  He settles into the
     saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.  There is no
     sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his
     settling himself into the saddle is any more than a
     routine position he has taken before to work on the
     Machine.

     Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)         65

     Passing clouds.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 66

     He looks upwards for several moments.  Then his hand
     slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the
     lever. - Gently he urges it forward.

     A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,
     but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from
     within the Machine.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANEL                             67

     The luminous dials show:  "31 December 1899."  The
     meters and indicators start to BUZZ and whirl.  The
     glow increases.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 68

     His expression is taut as he looks around, then down
     to the control panel.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I started...and the laboratory grew
               faint around me...



     INSERT OF PANEL                                        69

     The figures spin, the needles vibrate.  Then almost
     at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the
     lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine.  The
     HUMMING LESSENS and FADES.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 70

     As he starts to look up and around, slowly.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...I stopped.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             71

     Starting at the WINDOW with frost around the edges
     and icicles outside, we move around the room PASSING
     THE WORKBENCH over to the DOOR.  During this we HEAR the:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               No change; everything exactly as it
               bad been before. - But no!

     THE CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO THE WORKBENCH, CLOSE, where
     the clock now shows "11:09" and the candle has burned
     shorter.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (excited)
               The clock said 9:31 when I started and
               now it was 11:O9...and the candle,
               shorter by inches.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 72

     He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch
     from his pocket by its gold chain.  It flips open
     showing almost "9:32."

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And yet by my watch which was in the
               machine with me, only a few seconds
               had passed.

     Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the
     lever, looking off toward the:



     WORKBENCH - (ANIMATION)                                73

     The HUMMING SOUND STARTS again and, while the hands
     of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle
     flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the
     candle down.  The CAMERA MOVES to the window where the
     frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow.
     Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like
     gems and the sun starts to rise.



     TIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74

     The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab-
     oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and
     his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks
     up and squints.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It was disconcerting to see the sun...



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (STOP MOTION OR        75

     As the sun arches majestically.

               for the night, changes that normally
               took hours, occuring in seconds, was
               beautiful.

     During this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL
     rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then
     the flowers start to open again.  Light begins to flood
     the scene.

     In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses
     the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with
     the speed of wind streaks away.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 77

     A trace of a smile, then apprehension.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And as yet I was travelling very slowly!
                    (challenging)
               What if I went faster?!

     His hand shoves the lever farther over toward the
     future position.

     THE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time
     Traveller lurches in his seat, clings to the controls
     and looks at the dials.

     The sun soars across the sky, night falls.  Pin points
     of stars streak by and dawn comes.  The sun is chased
     by the stars again and again.  Faster and faster.



     VERY CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                           81

     His eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half
     pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating
     flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of
     another day.

     He turns toward the:



     WINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82

     Without a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has
     disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring.
     While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around
     the window like a snake and the flowers open and close,
     we see the following through repeated fast flashes.

                    The sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a)

                    The night falls and the stars circle    (b)

                    with thunderheads.  There is a
                    cataract of lightning and THUNDER.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83

     Quick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's
     face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It became intoxicating.  To see an
               entire storm in a few seconds. -
               So I pushed the lever on toward
               even greater speed.

     He applies greater pressure on the lever.  The
     HUMMING INCREASES.  The alternate flashes of light
     become a flicker almost too fast for the eye to
     follow.  He looks o.s. and sees:



     EXT. TREE IN GARDEN - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)          84

     Its shadows, cast by the sun and the moon, dance
     around the trunk, faster and faster -- the moon
     passing through its phases and the sun shifting
     its position with the seasons.



     BRANCHES - CLOSE SHOT - (ANIMATION)                    85

     Leaves grow quickly.  Flowers appear and turn into
     small green apples.  Growing larger, they turn red
     and fall.  The leaves gradually become amber and
     disappear.  Suddenly the bare branches are covered
     with snow for a few seconds, then again burst into
     green leaves and blossoms.



     EXT. DISTANT HILLSIDE - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)        86

     Through the window we see the trees grow and
     change like puffs of vapor -- now brown, now
     green; they spread, shiver and pass away.  Snow
     flashes across the country, vanishes and is
     followed by the brief bright green of Spring.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thirteen years had passed...fourteen...
               fifteen...sixteen...and then...

     Gradually soot, dirt and grime has built up on the
     windows from the outside and darkness prevails.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                87

     His brow is beaded with perspiration.  Alarmed,
     he grabs the handle of the Time Machine.



     INSERT:  THE DIALS                                     88

     The hand of the Time Traveller quickly pulls back
     the lever.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               In the year nineteen hundred seventeen...
               I stopped.

     The flickering of passing days and nights slows and
     the HUMMING SOUND GRADUALLY DIMINISHES.  The dial
     stops on "13 September 1917".



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             89

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he steps out of his Machine
     and glances with astonishment around the interior
     of the laboratory.  The once clear windows are now
     dirty and boarded up.  The world outside is
     completely obscured from view.  Only faint light
     penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out-
     doors.  He crosses to the door.  Dust falls as he
     opens it and enters the corridor.



     INT. LIBRARY                                           90

     The dim light and the protective sheets covering
     the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a
     ghostly appearance.  Tilted paintings reveal
     faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches
     thick here, as well as in the dining room seen
     in the b.g.  Cobwebs are everywhere.

     The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time
     Traveller, coming down the steps from the
     corridor, enters the room and looks about.



     THE SHELVES - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                  91

     Among his books still rest the clocks, his once
     prized possessions.  There is NO TICKING now.
     The hands of the clocks, each pair indicating a
     different time, seem to guard the past.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  92

     Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the
     library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front
     door.  It refuses to respond to his attempt to
     open it.  Even when he uses his shoulder it does
     not budge.  He steps back and flings his full
     weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it
     gives slightly.  Under continued pressure the
     nailed boards outside give way and a flood of
     daylight illuminates the dusty interior.  The
     Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that
     is now taken over by weeds.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - DAY                         93

     The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks
     curiously around.  Everything is overgrown with
     vines and flowers.  The house is boarded up.  He
     starts to wander around, thinking, investigating.

     (NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with
             distinctive landmarks that will stay
             recognizable during his journey into
             the future, thereby giving a clear
             conception that time-travelling does
             not involve geographical movement.
             For instance, the sharp curve of the
             River Thames in the distance will
             remain even after the house itself
             has disappeared.)

     Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE
     catches his attention.  He looks puzzled toward:



     EXT. ROAD - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                          95

     Coming up the hill on a narrow dusty road is a
     car of 1916 vintage, with the HORN HONKING.  The
     CAMERA PANS with it, up to a SMALL STORE across
     the street.  The sign above the entrance reads:
     "Filby's Department Store".  A MANNEQUIN,
     dressed for the period, is in the window.  The
     driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of
     the First World War, steps out of the car.  The
     Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend,
     sans moustache.



     TWO SHOT                                               96

               Going to a masquerade, David?  You
               look rather silly without your

               Were you addressing me, sir?

                    (positively)
               Filby!  I expected more of an
               enthusiastic greeting from...

                         FILBY (smiles as he
                    interrupts)
               I'm afraid you have me confused
               with my father, sir.  There was a
               remarkable resemblance. - I'm
               James Filby.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Was?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Were you a friend of father's?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...yes...I've been away.

                         JAMES FILBY
               He was killed in the war...a year
               ago.

               No!...it can't be...
                    (then, as he realizes its
                    truth)
               I'm sorry to hear that.
                    (pause, then hesitantly
                    points)
               And the gentleman who used to live
               across the street?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Oh, him.  Some inventor who
               disappeared around the turn of the
               century. - If you're interested in
               that house, forget it.  You can't
               buy it or even go inside.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why is that?

                         JAMES FILBY
               My father was executor of the
               inventor's estate and he refused to
               liquidate it.
                    (adds with a smile)
               I often chided him on that account,
               but he felt positive that the owner
               would return some day. - Some people
               hereabouts think it's haunted.
                    (stares at Time Traveller
                    curiously, studying the
                    strange cut of his clothes)
               Who are you, sir?

               Just a stranger who once knew your
               father.

                         JAMES FILBY
               I see.
                    (still curious at the Time
                    Traveller's abstract attitude)
               Have you been at the front, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Front?  What front?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Why the war, of course.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What war?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Great heavens, man, don't you know
               we've been at war with Germany
               since nineteen fourteen?  I thought
               perhaps you had seen action in
               France...or maybe...
                    (noticing confusion, adds
                    with a note of compassion)
               Perhaps a cup of tea would make
               you feel better.  Won't you come in?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No...no, thank you.

                         JAMES FILBY
               You're sure you're alright, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes, I'm quite alright.

                         JAMES FILBY (hesitantly)
               Then...goodbye, sir.

     The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly
     turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the
     Department Store.

     SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOCK)               109

     Through the panes of broken glass we see a clear
     but limited glimpse of the night sky that is
     swept by beams of searching lights.

     ANTI-AIRCRAFT batteries are FIRING as a squadron
     of Nazi fighter planes are caught in the criss-
     cross beams of light.  The sky is pierced with
     ack ack.  Then, following the sound OF APPROACHING RAF.
     FIGHTER PLANES, a dog fight ensues.  Several of the
     planes are hit and plummet earthward, balls of
     streaking flame and fire.

     Gazing up at the grim spectacle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The last time I had stopped was in
               nineteen seventeen, twenty three years
               ago.  And the war with Germany was
               still waging - now in the air with
               flying machines.  It didn't seem
               possible they could go on fighting
               all these years and still have the
               means of fighting.  Then I realized
               the truth of the matter.  This was a
               new war.  There must have been an
               interval of peace in between these
               wars.  Yet they had learned nothing
               but to prepare even more effective
               means of destroying one another.  I
               decided to push on into time and see
               the outcome.

     He looks down at:

     Denoting the movement of the Machine through time.
     The dials spin from 1940 to 1959 where the HUMMING
     NOISE SUBSIDES and the dials again come to a stop.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The fighting in the sky lasted only
               a few moments.  By nineteen forty five
               it was over, but I continued on a
               few more years before pausing for
               another glimpse of my silent, never
               aging friend.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It vas reassuring to find that she
               hadn't changed.  Only her costume.
               Provocative to say the least.  I
               wondered what she would look like
               ten years hence.

     With a grin he throws the lever forward.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        114

     HUMMING INCREASES and the years spin; 1960, 1961
     and so on until it finally STOPS on 1966.



     BACK AT THE MANNEQUIN                                  115

     a distant, then a close AIR RAID SIREN HOWLS,
     menacingly.

     His smile becomes a puzzled stare at what he sees.



     EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117

     People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND
     OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions
     comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period
     in disorder.

     The running is purposive, however.  All are entering
     particular buildings or, like those closest to the
     Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the
     sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky-
     ward.

     A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped
     as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers
     her up in his arms and rushes back to safety.

     In a few seconds the streets are deserted.



     TIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT               118

     The Time Traveller gets out and looks around,
     confused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               At first I wondered if my Machine and
               I were the cause of the panic.  I was
               to soon find out we weren't.

     He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA
     MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair-
     way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one
     below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s.,
     a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly,
     until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's
     attention.



     EXT. STORE WINDOW - FULL SHOT                          119

     A TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is
     operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra
     led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow.
     The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S
     DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches
     the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he
     intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors
     fly wide open.

     He stops startled, looking about to see who opened
     them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward.



     INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LONG SHOT                      120

     From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes
     the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller
     enters and turns his attention to other products
     of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,
     reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the
     significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud
     of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he
     is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks
     off.



     REVERSE SHOT                                           121

     Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a
     plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white
     crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian
     Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask
     as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (shakes his head)
               I can't understand you.

     The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David
     Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young
     man.  He is now in his mid-sixties.

                         WARDEN
                    (looking at helmet)
               Confounded radio in this thing.
               Makes more noise than it does sense.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (recognizing him)
               Filby!

                         WARDEN
               My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't
               you hear the air raid siren?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You mean that horrible screeching?

                         WARDEN
               It wasn't constructed for its
               aesthetic values, you know, but to
               warn silly young fools like yourself
               to get down into the shelter.  Now
               go on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But I'm perfectly comfortable and
               I find your store magnificent.  What
               splendid achievements, what gigantic
               strides mankind has taken, what...

                         WARDEN
                    (interrupting)
               Come on, young man.  We'd better be
               going before the mushrooms start
               sprouting.
                    (looks at Time Traveller
                    with renewed interest)
               You do look familiar.  Haven't
               we met somewhere before?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many
               years ago.

                         WARDEN
               I was sure of that, but the exact
               time escapes me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               It was two wars ago, I believe.
               Nineteen seventeen.

                         WARDEN (awed)
               Why now I recall.  The chap who
               inquired about my father -- and
               the house that used to be across
               the way.
                    (stops and stares at
                    the Time Traveller)
               But no...that's impossible.  You
               haven't changed.  You're not a day
               older.  And your clothes...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm afraid it's going to take me
               a little time to explain... You see...

     There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.  It
     lasts for three seconds.

                         WARDEN
               The last alert...hurry!

     He grabs the Time Traveller by the arm and drags
     him out.

     They emerge from the store.  The Time Traveller
     pulls himself free.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen to me!  It's important.

                         WARDEN (points to sky)
               Look!  An atomic satellite zeroing
               in!  That's important!!

     The Warden runs, looks back over shoulder, calling.

                         WARDEN
               Hurry!  Hide 'til the All Clear!

     He descends into the air raid shelter.

     He looks puzzled.

               All clear?
                    (yells)
               I've got to talk to you.

     The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the
     APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE.  Alarmed,
     he runs across the street directly in the path
     of the ambulance that threads its way between the
     cars left in disorder on the road.  The driver
     spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts
     crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller.
     Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.  He stops and
     looks startled.

     A SATELLITE travels over the city in the distance.
     The flash is followed by an EXPLOSION and a giant
     cobalt mushroom begins to rise over the horizon.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          125

     As the Time Traveller tries again to rush toward
     his Machine, the shockwaves reach him and throw him
     to the ground.  He looks back, desperately.



     THE CITY - LONG SHOT - (MINIATURE)                     126

     Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see
     the once proud city of the future in ruins.  Only
     a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand-
     ing for a moment, then it also collapses in an instant.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The labor of centuries gone in an
               instant.

     The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden
     a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as
     though the earth were being torn apart.  It zig-zags
     down the street and from the widening fissure clouds
     of smoke and steam rise.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's
               violence, responded with volcanic
               violence or her own!



     CHASM IN THE GROUND - (STOCK)                          127

     The smoke and steam give way to a spluttering of
     red hot lava which swells slowly at first in a
     rising tide and then spilling over begins to
     EXPLODE into the air.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 128

     THE STREETS - (STOCK, MINIATURE, SPLIT)                130

     With red hot lava swirling around the bases of the
     remaining buildings.  The lower parts of the struct-
     ures in the f.g. dissolve into smoke and flame and
     the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising
     red flood.  Then the incoming rush of the river
     meets the flowing tide of lava.  The two opposite
     elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf
     the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and
     meet with explosive fury.  The air is rent with the
     SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling
     rock.  Steam whitens the sky.



     THE TIME MACHINE - LONG SHOT - (STOCK) - (PROCESS)     131

     Out of the tumult a flow of red hot lava turns
     aside and leaps directly toward the Time Machine.

               I prayed...wondering how many centuries,
               how many eons must pass before the wind
               and rain could wear away the mountain
               that enclosed me.

     In the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of
     the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED
     BREATHING of the Time Traveller.

     Then a match flickers.  The CAMERA SCARES BACK.  The
     Time Traveller holds up a burning matchstick, his
     face glistening with perspiration as he leans forward
     to look at the dials.

     They roll very fast.  We can distinguish only the
     passing of years -- 70,000...80,000...90,000...
     100,000.  Then the matchlight flickers and goes
     out leaving only the dial's own faint glow.

     Once again there is darkness and the MONOTONOUS HUM

     to calm himself.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I wondered if there was still war
               being waged on the ground above me...
               if man would still exist on earth,
               when I saw the sun again.

     As he speaks, the Time Machine goes faster and faster.
     HIGH PITCHED HUMMING INCREASES.

               my trust in time and waited for
               the rock to wear down around me.

     A white light from above begins to permeate the dark-
     ness.  The Time Traveller looks up, his face showing
     immense relief.

     Everything is a blur except the Time Machine with its

     is now finally entirely above ground, the only distinct
     object in the whirling transparent landscape.

     There is an impression of several great buildings

               learned to control both the elements

     As he eagerly pulls hard on the lever, the HUMMING
     DECREASES and the dial freezes on:  "23 November
     802,701".  THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the
     Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.  The CAMERA
     ZOOMS BACK TO A FULL HIGH SHOT as the machine keels
     over.  The friction caused by the intrusion creates
     a pitiless HAIL, and we

                                    SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT - (DAY)               144

     Thick mist eddies about his face, undulating
     dreamily, revealing enough to see that he is
     unconscious.  Blood seeps from a gash across his
     forehead.  He dazedly opens his eyes to find that
     he is gazing across the dewey, green turf.  Then
     he looks up.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - LOW ANGLE - (MATTE)      145

     The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great
     bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon
     clawed feet support the white marble figure of an
     immense Sphinx.  The figure has the face of a
     woman, the body of a huge cat and the tail of a
     serpent.  A weeping birch tree barely touches its
     outspread wings.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         146

     He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED
     BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.  Still half-
     dazed he presses a handkerchief to his temple, as
     he loosens his collar, then reaches into the Machine,
     pockets the lever and surveys his surroundings.



     LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT - (MATTE)                        147

     It looks like a garden untended for centuries.  The
     trees and shrubs are laden with strange blossoms or
     exotic fruits.

     In the distance there is a building that might once
     have been a temple.  Vines mat the ancient walls,
     seemingly holding them together.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 148

     He smiles.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to himself)
               At last I've found a Paradise.

     He starts off toward the building WHISTLING his
     favorite tune, "The Land Of The Leal".  The CAMERA
     ACCOMPANIES him as he looks about with interest.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             149

     Strange, exotic fruits bend the branches of the
     TREES, some purplish and gourd-shaped, others
     suggesting giant raspberries, mangoes, etc.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Nature tamed completely and more
               bountiful than ever before.



     VARIETY OF FLOWERS - MOVING SHOT                       150

     The CAMERA PANS under boughs laden with orchids and
     a multitude of other gorgeous blossoms.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Flowers everywhere...the whole landscape
               one vast garden with no sign of weeds or
               briars.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT - (DAY)    151

     The Time Traveller pauses and looks up at the building.



     ACROSS FACADE - PAN DOWN - (MINIATURE?)                152

     Vines creep up the crevices.  The ornamental stone
     work, while rich in detail, is weathered and
     broken with age.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (surprised)
               Unrepaired for centuries!  Maybe
               unlived in for as long.
                    (then)
               It would be no Paradise if it
               belonged to me alone.



     INT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT                              153

     Shooting through the ARCHWAY we see the Time
     Traveller mount the steps and enter the building.



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (MATTE) - (DAY)      154

     In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller
     halts.  He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted
     ceiling.  Although ancient in appearance, everything
     is ultra modern in design.  Sunlight streams through
     windows where half the panes of stained glass are
     broken.  Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along
     the walls, and at random about the floor are low
     tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls
     of fruit.

     His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the
     Time Traveller crosses to:



     A TABLE - MED. SHOT                                    155

     The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of
     exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as
     though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication
     of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air
     hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time
     Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his
     eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to
     this strange place.  There is none.

     Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS
     with it on the top of the table.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouting)
               Anyone here?

     But an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re-
     traces his steps and leaves the great hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     156

     Pick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along.
     Every sense he possesses is on the alert.  His eyes
     probe every bush and tree and object that could
     possibly conceal some person or thing.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        157-161

     As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk,
     INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects
     he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he
     reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life
     or movement.

     The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave
     of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows
     as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into
     tension and gradually but inevitably approaches
     the state of horror that a human being would
     experience in a strange place where he had just
     come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe
     fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but
     weird vacuum.



     EXT. WOODED AREA - LONG SHOT                           162

     As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees,
     he hesitates, then moves into the forest.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        163-166

     The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of
     darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles
     to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks
     with continued wariness through the trees, glancing
     from left to right and occasionally stopping dead
     still and quickly darting a glance behind him at
     what he imagines to be some sound of movement.
     But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is
     nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest.

     Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar
     and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND
     SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some
     dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out.



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167

     The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by
     the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the
     PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool
     and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand.
     They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace
     and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new
     world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded
     by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it
     from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream
     emerges in a swift torrent.



     ANOTHER, CLOSER SHOT                                   168

     A beautiful GIRL, dressed in a silken robe of white
     and gold, starts running.  As she runs, she loosens
     her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep
     into the crystal water.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                169

     He smiles philosophically and leans back against a
     tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (musingly,
                    to himself)
               So this is man's future...



     GROUP SHOT                                             170

     The people, apparently without any cares of the
     world, play, romp and swim.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               ...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in
               the clear streams and eat the fruits
               of earth with all knowledge of work
               and hardship forgotten.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 171

     He pauses, thinking back on what he has just said.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, and why not?

     Suddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool.
     He turns.



     THE POOL - LONG SHOT                                   172

     The Girl has swum out too far and is caught by the
     swift torrent.  She CRIES OUT PITEOUSLY.

     The other people turn their heads toward her, but
     make no move to help.



     CLOSE ON GIRL                                          173

     She has caught a ledge of rock and clings.  Two
     little men, their bare feet dangling in the water,
     sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           174

     He jumps out from the foliage, rushes to the bank,
     points toward the Girl and tries to attract the
     attention of those near her on the bank.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Help her!...

     No one moves.  He runs toward the ledge.



     BACK TO THE GIRL                                       175

     Her grasp on the ledge grows weaker.  She is at
     the point of letting go.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           176

     Reaching the ledge, he pushes past the people nearby
     and grasps the Girl's wrist just as her fingers
     slip.  Quickly, he pulls her out of the river's
     turbulent current and lifts her up in his arms.



     GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE UP                                177

     Looking up at the Time Traveller bewildered, she
     shows neither fear nor gratitude.



     TIME TRAVELLER - EXTREME CLOSE UP                      178

     Gazing back at the Girl thoroughly puzzled.  He
     turns and glances down at the two little people
     on the ledge.



     CLOSE TWO SHOT                                         179

     These two men will later be known as the YOUNG MAN
     and the MAN IN WHITE.  They return the Time Travel-
     ler's look of scorn with pleasant smiles as if they
     do not know the meaning of a mean look.



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE, MOVING SHOT     180

     Trying to avoid looking at the dripping, robeless
     Girl - after all he is a Victorian - he carries her
     to the safety of the bank and sets her down on the
     sandy beach beneath the trees.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him as he straightens, then quickly takes off his
     jacket and throws it around her.

     He looks at her for the first time sees the almost
     ultimate in feminine beauty.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - FULL SHOT                      181

     Wearing his velvet jacket very appealingly, she
     calmly rises, turns and, without a word, walks
     away.  The Time Traveller stares after her in
     astonishment.

     The disconcerned people, now all dressed in multi-
     colored robes, are leaving the pool.  They walk
     past the Time Traveller as though he was a part of
     the scenery, merely adding to his confusion.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                182

     Perplexed.

                                      DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - (SUNSET)         183

     Shooting toward the ARCHWAY.  The sun is sinking as
     the last stragglers of the little people enter the
     great hall.  The Time Traveller slowly follows them.
     He pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back
     to either welcome him or resent his intrusion, but
     they move on with lack of interest, completely.  He
     sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this
     utter indifference.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             184

     Seated on the steps leaning against a column.  He
     senses another's presence, looks about, sees no one,
     then turns to glance over his shoulder.  The Girl, now
     wearing her robe and holding his jacket over her arm,
     appears from behind the column.  He looks at her and
     smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her. -
     She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and
     returns his jacket.  While he slowly slips it on,
     she slides down a step to sit alongside him.

                         THE GIRL
               Why did you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why did I what?

                         THE GIRL
               Come after me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (ironic)
               I did it to save your life, young
               lady, which I'm afraid doesn't hold
               much meaning for you or anyone else.

                         THE GIRL (simply)
               It doesn't.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Must have been fifty of your friends
               watching you drown.  Not one of
               them so much as lifted a finger. -
                    (shakes his head)
               A curious attitude - in a curious
               world.
                    (a pause, then a
                    smile)
               Aren't you the least bit interested
               in what I am...where I come from?

                         THE GIRL (innocently)
               Should I be?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiles)
               Perhaps you'd better take me to
               someone a bit older I can talk to.

                         THE GIRL
               There is no one older.

     The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth
     of her words.  All of the little people seem to be
     of the Girl's age or younger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone age in this land
               of yours?

     The Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the
     sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already
     fallen over the distant hills.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's your name?

                         THE GIRL
               Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you spell that?

                         WEENA
               Spell?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Write!  - Can't you write?  Look!

     He bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw
     on the ground.



     INSERT: DUST                                           185

     As the stick writes out: " W E E N A "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          186

     She shows little interest.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               And what are your people called?

                         WEENA (as if he ought to know)
               Eloi.



     INSERT OF DUST                                         187

     The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          188

     A shadow crosses her face.  Suddenly she springs
     to her feet, concerned.

                         WEENA
               Come.  We must go in.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (rising)
               Why?  What's wrong?

                         WEENA (anxiously)
               It is getting dark.

     She grabs his hand and pulls him toward:



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - LONG SHOT - (MATTE?) - (DAY)     189

     Crowded now.  The people of the future are sitting
     on cushions around the tables, having their evening
     meal.  The glowing orange light of the setting sun
     pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at-
     mosphere to the place.  No one pays attention to
     Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the
     b.g.



     AT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190

     A score of attractive young men and young women are
     enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos-
     phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look
     up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the
     table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He
     takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White
     who sit across the table from him and tries to engage
     them in conversation.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (directed to
                    Young Man, but meant for the
                    entire group)
               I don't mind telling you, I'm quite
               hungry.  I've come a long, long way.

     Looks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is
     none.

     He bites into the fruit.  It's good.  While he is
     eating he searches for another way to bring up the
     subject.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               In my time a berry this size would
               have made news in every civilized
               country.

     There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man
     again.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.
               Perhaps even courtesy has died, but
               I have come a long way and there are
               things I would like to know.

                         YOUNG MAN (considers a
                    moment, then)
               Why?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because I shall return to my time
               and they will ask questions such as
               what kind of government rules your
               world.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               We have no government.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (speaking
                    as though to a child)
               You must have a body of men who pass
               and enforce laws.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               There are no laws.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (taken aback,
                    then)
               How do you get your food and clothing?

     The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him.
     They both shrug their shoulders.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone work?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks up
                    fruit)
               Then where does this come from?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               It grows.  It always grows.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But it must be planted, cultivated,
               nurtured...unless...
                    (with mistaken insight as he
                    observes no reaction to this
                    last query)
               Unless you have an economy so well
               organized that you can devote all your
               time to study and experimentation.
               Am I right?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               You ask many questions.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (annoyed)
               Yes!  And I'm not ashamed of it.
               That is how man has learned and
               bettered himself.  I must learn about
               you and your civilization.  You have
               books, don't you?

                         YOUNG MAN (recognizing a
                    half-forgotten word)
               Books. - Books!  Yes, we have books.

     He rises and beckons.  The Time Traveller's brow
     clears.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Books will tell me what I want to
               know.  Books will tell me all about
               you.

     He too gets up and follows the Young Man.



     AT THE WALL - LONG SHOT                                193

     The Young Man leading.  He reaches the wall and
     seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.  A
     cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the
     curtain falls, almost crumbling.  Shelves and
     shelves of books are disclosed.  The books are
     old even though many of them have futuristic de-
     signs.  The bindings of once proud volumes hang in
     brown tatters.  The Time Traveller steps to the
     books.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                194

     The realization of the true state of affairs shows
     on his face.  He is appalled.  Carefully he pulls
     a volume from the shelf.  Its binding breaks as
     he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages,
     they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor.
     He drops the book.  His voice is a shocked WHISPER.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...they do tell me all about you!

     With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole
     shelf of books.  His hand plows through them and
     the dust swirls into the air.  He turns back in
     anger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What have you done?  Thousands of
               years of building and rebuilding
               creating and re-creating so that
               you can let it crumble to dust.

     With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               A million yesterdays of sensitive
               men dying for their dreams.  For
               what?  So you can swim and dance
               and play.

     He releases him and leaves.



     THE HALL - MOVING SHOT                                 195

     The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating
     them for their dissipation.

     Without emotion they watch him walk toward the
     entrance.  Only Weena jumps to her feet.  Her
     former indifference is gone.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        196

     From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down
     at them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I am returning to my time!  Not to
               tell of the uselessness of the
               struggle - not to tell of the
               hopeless future - but only so that
               I can die among men!

     He turns and strides toward the door.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197

     The Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A
     moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She
     stands there, looking after him.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. FOREST - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                      198

     There are patches of mist and haze between the
     trees.  With a blazing torch the Time Traveller
     strides across.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER ON THE PATH - (NIGHT)              199

     Coming from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO
     THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking
     the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con-
     sternation.  He raises the torch high to see:



     EXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200

     There is no Time Machine.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201

     In stunned shock.



     THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202

     Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries
     toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn
     looking for his Machine, beating the branches with
     his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes,
     a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and
     disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the
     Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn
     where the Machine was last seen.

     (NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot
             where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)

     He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.
     Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud-
     denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the
     pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he
     had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.
     Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his
     knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes
     the grass.



     THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203

     The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as
     though some heavy object had been dragged across.
     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves
     and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot-
     prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned
     earth.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204

     He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed.
     Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow-
     ing the grooves.



     BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves
     straight across the lawn to the flagstones around
     the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the
     stones leading to the wide panel in the base of
     the pedestal.  Here the marks end.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206

     The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an
     exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.

     The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the
     claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free,
     he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either
     to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife
     from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's
     edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success.

     Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a
     loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this
     heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow
     it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times
     he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock
     shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207

     He senses he is under observation by an unseen
     presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up
     to:



     THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208

     The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in
     the torch light.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209

     He turns and peers toward:



     THE BUSHES                                             210

     In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a
     wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the
     flame of the torch.



     TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213

     He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly
     paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap-
     proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,
     followed by a ghostly impression of pale,
     fleeing creatures.

     The Time Traveller halts and turns in another
     direction.  The same thing happens.

     Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch
     against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now
     in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering
     around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves
     into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.



     THE PATH                                               214

     Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure
     approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the
     other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment
     there is a struggle and then the other figure lies
     perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to
     get a look at it.



     THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216

     It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller
     reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an
     expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be
     waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does
     not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the
     Time Traveller and her face records a wave of
     relief.

     The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time
     Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.

                         WEENA
               I heard you pounding...I came to
               tell you...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you open that panel?

                         WEENA
               No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?

     A look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts
     her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.
     Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns
     her to face him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?

     Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups
     his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her
     head back so that her eyes meet his.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Tell me.

                         WEENA
               When they call, we must go below.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Do the Morlocks live beneath the
               earth?
                    (Weena nods)
               Why must you obey their command?

                         WEENA
               They give us the food we eat, the
               clothes we wear.  We must do as
               they command.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What happens to your people when
               they go below?

                         WEENA (repressing an in-
                    voluntary shudder)
               No one knows.  No one has ever
               returned.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling
                    at her warmly, reassuringly)
               It won't happen to you.

     Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find-
     ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot
     understand.  Then she glances high into the dark sky
     and the old fear returns.

                         WEENA
               It is night.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Only children are frightened by
               the dark. - But then you are a
               child, aren't you?
                    (Weena glances around
                    warily into the shadows,
                    her anxiety mounting)
               I'll build a fire.

                         WEENA (taking his
                    hand, rises)
               Let us go from here.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (getting
                    up)
               I can't, child.
                    (walking toward the sphinx)
               My Machine is inside there, I
               intend to wait here 'til morning,
               then find some way of getting
               inside.

                         WEENA (catching up)
               No, you must not.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (stops,
                    then)
               Help me gather some wood.

     Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which
     she hands over to him.

                         WEENA
               Where are you from?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks
                    up dry branches)
               As a matter of fact, I'm from
               right here.
                    (gesturing)
               There's where my house stood many
               thousands of years ago.  Here - to
               that monument, was my laboratory.
               About there was my library where I
               once sat talking with friends about
               my Time Machine.

     Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the
     bushes in the f.g.

                    (continuing)
               I hoped to learn a great deal.  I
               hoped to take back the knowledge,
               the advancement, mankind made...
               instead what do I find?  Vegetables!

     Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly
     from behind her.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219

     With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (continuing)
               The human race reduced to living
               vegetables!



     BACK TO WEENA                                          220

     The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear
     paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221

     He is about to light a match, but finds he needs
     more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Get me a few more twigs.

     When there is no answer he turns and looks.



     AT THE BUSHES                                          222

     Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to
     RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena
     slowly disappearing under the brush.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223

     We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING
     FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller
     toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws
     her to the pile of dry branches.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after calming her)
               What was it?

               This seems to keep them away.

     She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly
     she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the
     flame.

     The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost
     too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more
     amazement than pain.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while
                    examining her hand)
               What ever made you put your hand in
               the fire?

                         WEENA
               I never saw it before.

     Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases
     her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits
     down beside her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after a long silence)
               Do you know that the first thing
               which separated man from the rest
               of the mammals was his knowledge of
               fire?
                    (he looks at her)
               No, I suppose you don't.
                    (pokes at fire)
               The next great stride came with
               the discovery of the wheel.
                    (turns to her)
               Do you know what that is?
                    (she shakes her head)
               I'm sorry I was angry with your
               people.  I had no right to be.
               No more than if I had visited the
               Island of Bali in my own time.
               You were safe inside your great
               house, yet you came out into the
               night to warn me.  The one
               characteristic which distinguished
               man from the animal kingdom was the
               spirit of self sacrifice.  You have
               that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all
               of your people have it.  All it
               requires is someone to reawaken it.
               I shall try if you'll let me.  Will
               you?

                         WEENA
               I do not understand you, but I
               believe you.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's a good start. - Now try to
               tell me...who or what are the Morlocks?
                    (Weena looks at him blankly)
               Are they people or animals?
                    (her expression remains unchanged)
               What do you know about yourself?  The
               past?  Don't your people ever speak
               of the past?

                         WEENA
               There is no past.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Don't you ever wonder about the future?

                         WEENA
               There is no future.



     ANOTHER ANGLE                                          226

     The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring
     the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with
     compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within
     her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of
     the words.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Man's past is mainly a grim struggle
               for survival, but there have been
               moments when a few voices have spoken
               up.  These rare moments have made the
               history of man a glorious thing.  I
               refuse to believe it is dead and gone.
               We've had our dark ages before and
               this is only another of them.  All
               you need is for someone to show you
               the way out. - I'm only a tinkering
               mechanic, but there must be this
               hidden spark in one of your people.
               If I can only kindle that spark, my
               coming here will have some meaning.

     During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him,
     her cheek touching his knee.  He looks down at her
     and sees he has made a friend.  He places his hand
     gently on her hair.  She looks up, her eyes no
     longer showing fear.  Their faces are illuminated
     by the dancing flames.



     THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT                                  227

     It CRACKLES reassuringly.

                                     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                          228

     The ring of flames from the previous scene is
     seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from
     which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT
     MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.  The
     CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE
     where more wells are visible in the distance,
     each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.  Their
     roofs are shining brass-like disks.

     Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx,
     approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket
     over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               My efforts next morning to open the
               panel were fruitless.  I had to find
               another way to retrieve my Machine.

     Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller
     walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into:



     THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                                 229

     It descends into darkness, but near the top can be
     seen handholds in an irregular pattern.  The
     THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous.



     AT THE MOUTH OF WELL - FULL SHOT                       230

     The Time Traveller in the f.g. turns back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen!
                    (pause)
               Do you hear?

                         WEENA (fearfully)
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Machines!

                         WEENA
               No...Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (straightening, amazed)
               You mean those animals run machines?

                         WEENA
               They are Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (as he walks to her)
               I know, but have you seen the
               machines?



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         231

     She shakes her head.

                         WEENA
               No, only heard of them.

     The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller
     as he reaches her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Who told you?

                         WEENA
               The talking rings.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (moves closer to her)
               What sort of rings?

                         WEENA
                    (with a shrug)
               Rings that talk.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Can you show me these rings?

     Weena nods and starts off.  He follows her.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:



     INT. GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                    232

     Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past
     the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books
     that the Young Man had previously shown him.

     She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone
     corridor.  He follows.



     INT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233

     Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor
     where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear
     around the corner.



     INT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234

     The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of
     a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish
     colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no
     windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent
     dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course
     of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is
     evidently a place that no one bothers to visit.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235

     Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they
     walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still
     existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are
     broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos-
     phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize
     objects and machines, some belonging to the early
     part of the twentieth century and still others take
     on the forms and shapes that the audience of today
     will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass
     cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond
     comprehension.

     Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken
     case which contains several boxes of golden rings
     a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined
     with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the
     nearest box and examines its contents.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (picking up a ring)
               Are these the talking rings?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               They speak?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of what?

                         WEENA
               Things no one here understands.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you get it to talk?

     Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and
     lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its
     edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top.



     INSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236

     A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current
     of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono-
     graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the
     surface of one of our records.

                         VOICE FROM RING
               Whomsoever chances upon these rings
               will probably hear the last recorded
               voice of civilized man.  This is the
               year four thousand eight hundred and
               twenty-nine.



     TWO SHOT                                               237

     The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and
     Weena in disinterested detachment.

                         VOICE FROM RING (cont'd)
               The war between the East and West,
               which is now in its three hundredth
               and twenty-sixth year has at last
               come to an end.  There is nothing
               left to fight with and few of us
               left to fight.  The atmosphere has
               become so polluted with deadly
               germs that it can no longer be
               breathed.  There is no place on
               this planet that is immune.  The
               last surviving factory for the
               manufacture of oxygen has been
               destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly
               diminishing and when they are gone,
               we must die...

     The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY.
     The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for
     the second ring and spins it.

                         ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING
               This is the last day.  We, the last
               to survive, have had our final meeting.
               We have decided to split into two
               groups.  Each man and woman has made
               his own decision.  Some have chosen
               to take refuge in the great caverns
               and find a new way of life far down
               below the earth's surface.  The rest
               of us have decided to take our chances
               in the sunlight, small as those chances
               may be.

     The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no
     more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the
     third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are
     heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over
     floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                238

     As he watches the last ring spin to a standstill.
     Over this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               From the talking rings I learned how
               the human race divided itself and
               how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks
               began.

     He turns.



     GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT                               239

     The Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena
     hurries after him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               By some quirk of fate the Morlocks
               had become the masters and the Eloi
               their servants.  The Morlocks main-
               tained them and bred them like cattle
               only to take them below when they
               reached maturity, which explained why
               there were no older people along them.

     They exit.



     GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240

     The Time Traveller, followed by Weena, walks from
     the book shelves toward the entrance.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Now I knew I must go below.  It was
               the only means of finding a way up
               into the sphinx to reach my Machine
               and to find out what happened to the
               little people when they went below.

     They leave the Great Hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     241

     The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells.
     Weena senses his intention and catches up with him
     to grasp his arm.

                         WEENA
               No...don't go...please.

     He shakes her off.



     AT MOUTH OF WELL - MED. SHOT                           242

     The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall.
     Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead
     of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of
     sight by the current from the shaft.  Then he looks
     around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and
     listens.

     After a PLOP is heard he puts his arm down the
     shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then
     throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts
     to descend.  Weena rushes to his side to stop him.

                         WEENA
               You will not come back.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll be back.

     Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him
     a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his
     pocket.  The Time Traveller smiles as he dis-
     appears.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        243

     Locking from below, the top of the well appears
     like a small blue disk with Weena peering down.
     The Time Traveller gropes his way.

     Suddenly from the far distance comes the SOUND of
     LOW but POWERFUL SIREN.  Weena straightens.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         244

     An expression of fear comes slowly over her face
     as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER
     PITCH.  The Two make a grating dissonance.  Slowly
     she turns in the direction of the sound.



     BACK WITH TIME TRAVELLER                               245

     He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.



     BACK TO WEENA                                          246

     As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two,
     Weena's fear is gone.  In its place is an expres-
     sion of utter resignation.  Like someone in a
     trance she opens her eyes and stares straight
     ahead.  Then, as though she is summoning all her
     strength to go through some ordeal, she starts
     walking away.  The CAMERA PANS and we see the breeze
     ripple her silken robe about her as she moves.

     (NOTE:  During the above and throughout the follow-
             ing sequence the dirge-like WHISTLES
             CONTINUE, ECHOING mournfully.)



     REVERSE SHOT                                           247

     Weena is walking forward and disappears behind the
     trees as the Time Traveller emerges from the well
     in the b.g.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                248

     Looking for Weena.  She is nowhere to be seen.
     His face shows exasperation, bewilderment.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Where are you, Girl?



     WEENA - FULL SHOT                                      249

     She continues to walk toward the source of the
     SIRENS.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           250

     The DIRGE-LIKE MELODY becomes LOUDER, pulsating,
     as he pauses to watch:



     EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                251

     Emerging from the forest are two Eloi, a man and
     a woman.  They are several paces apart and pay no
     attention to one another.  Both have exactly the
     same manner as Weena.  They walk along, eyes
     straight ahead, faces expressionless.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                252

     As he looks ahead, then left and right, searching.



     VARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)                      253-254

     In the open country now, the forest behind them.
     In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly
     across the green landscape.

     All are converging toward a single point somewhere
     ahead.



     WEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255

     They walk close together, paying no attention to one
     another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY
     STRAINS OF THE SIRENS.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 256

     His concern has turned to apprehension as he tries
     to grasp the meaning of what he observes.



     EXT. THE SIRENS ON THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY)      257
     (MINIATURE)

     It is the source of the sound.  There are little
     bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as
     they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe
     organ behind the Sphinx.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258

     All of them walk in the same direction.  The Time
     Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered.
     But the Eloi disregard him and march straight
     ahead, eyes forward.

     The Time Traveller breaks into a run.



     TWO SHOT                                               259

     The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes
     his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass
     the shadows of the marching Eloi.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's happening?  Tell me!

     The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to
     free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical.
     This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at
     him, releasing his grip.

     The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about
     and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re-
     mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING
     SIRENS are now getting on his nerves.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -      260
     (DAY)

     The Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in
     a trance-like state.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261

     From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes
     are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres-
     sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind
     is marching to some unknown doom.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262

     He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind.
     But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases
     her, then goes on again, covering his ears with
     his palms, fighting to retain command of his own
     reason.



     SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)              263-265

     At various angles -- up, sideways, tilted.  The
     WAILING is DEAFENING.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                266

     He still strives to control himself, moves forward,
     then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267

     It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have
     been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the
     Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open,
     revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal.

     And despite their previous repugnance to the
     Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across
     the lawn resolutely to it.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268

     The Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters
     the wide opening and starts descending into sub-
     terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among
     them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               Weena!

     Without hearing him she passes through the entrance.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           269

     He desperately pushes forward, elbowing his way
     past others in his haste to overtake Weena.  The
     crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the
     Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouts in
                    despair)
               Weena!



     THE PANEL                                              270

     Slowly closing and the sound of the SIRENS gradually
     DIES AWAY.  The Time Traveller reaches the panel as
     it shuts tight before he can touch it.  He spreads
     his palms against it in despair, then turns to face
     those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside.  What
     he sees astonishes him.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          271

     They no longer approach the sphinx.  The ceasing of
     the sirens seems to have released them from their
     hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened,
     they are retreating.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 272

     As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones
     and calls out angrily.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Stop!



     BACK TO ELOI                                           273

     Featuring the Man in White in the f.g.  They halt
     and stare back.  The Time Traveller's voice comes
     over like a whip.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               What are you running from?

     None of the Eloi answer.



     TOWARD THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT                          274

     Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in
     the shadow of the white sphinx.  He steps slowly
     forward onto the lawn, looking around the big
     semi-circle of his audience.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply,
                    gesturing back toward the panel)
               Where have they gone?
                    (no answer)
               What happens to them?
                    (no answer)
               Don't stand there like a fatted
               cattle grazing contentedly in lush
               pastures. - Answer me!  What's
               wrong?

                         MAN IN WHITE (calmly)
               There is nothing wrong.  It is all
               clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What do you mean, all clear?

                         MAN IN WHITE (repeating)
               All clear!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (thinking
                    rapidly, talking to himself)
               Once....in the middle nineteen
               hundreds I heard a man...
                    (it bursts upon him)
               The falling bombs!
                    (to the Man in white
                    and the crowd)
               That's over.  Gone.  Dead for
               hundreds of thousand of years.
               There are no more flying machines.
               No bombs.  No wars!

                         MAN IN WHITE
               Yes, the rings have told us that
               story.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED SHOT                              275

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you didn't listen.  You didn't
               learn anything.  All that is left
               is fear...a blind animal fear.
               Ages ago men were taught to hide in
               the ground when the sirens blew...
               taught to run from a raining death...
               but those men are dead!  And so are
               the men who slaughtered them.  Don't
               you understand?
                    (looks around pleadingly)
               You are slaves of a dead past... You
               don't even own your souls.  You're
               led to slaughter like sheep!

                         MAN IN WHITE (o.s.)
               But there is nothing to fear now,
               it's all clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What about those who went below?
               How are they to come back?



     MAN IN WHITE                                           276

     He looks ominously at the Time Traveller.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               They never come back.  Nobody can
               bring them back.

     Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man
     in White following them.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 277

     Calling after them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You can try.  Won't any of you
               even try?

     He sees that the situation is hopeless.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               Well, someone has to try!

     He runs off.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        278

     The Time Traveller running through the forest.         (a)

     He is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b)

     The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c)
     of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller.



     EXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279

     Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his
     breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve
     as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts
     to descend.

     Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be
     heard.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280

     The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls
     with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is
     dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER.



     IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281

     As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker
     it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as
     well.

     Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely
     saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest,
     glancing upward.



     FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282

     A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching
     the Time Traveller's progress.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283

     A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally
     to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost
     complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the
     tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his
     belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers
     ahead.



     INT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1

     The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g.,
     pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then
     starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall.
     The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver-
     ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and
     grotesque shadows.

     (NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF
             MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this
             scene as well as the following sequence.)



     CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2

     Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously
     moves toward:



     INT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3

     At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T.
     pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the
     cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly
     disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight
     that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and
     horror.



     THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4

     This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks.
     In the flickering light we see stone tables and
     scattered around the floor far below the unmistak-
     able remains of human bones after the flesh has been
     carnivorously picked away.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
               So, this was the destiny of the
               Eloi.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5

     His features twisted in horror in the flickering
     light of his match.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               They were being bred like cattle
               by the Morlocks who had degenerated
               into the lowest form of human
               life...cannibalism.

     The match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a
     shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber
     of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale,
     spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g.
     descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise.



     MACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6

     Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their
     mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending
     the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the
     intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then
     hide.



     STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7

     The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway
     that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of
     the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T.
     is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals
     itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock
     appears at the top of the stairs and follows.

     Young Man are side by side.



     AT THE MACHINES                                        283X16

     The Morlocks who followed the T.T. are closing in.



     BACK TO T.T. - MOVING SHOT                             283X17

     He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him.  Hugging
     the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible
     point where he can still remain unobserved by the
     herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention.  He
     reaches out.

                         T.T.
               Weena!

     But she continues on with complete resignation to her
     fate.  Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid-
     ing place and grasps her by the shoulders.

                         T.T.
                    (shaking her)
               Girl!
                    (he turns and grasps the
                    passing Young Man)
               Come to your senses!  All of you!

     As the T.T. pulls Weena toward the staircase, the
     Young Man follows.



     FOOT OF STAIRWAY                                       283X18

     Morlocks block the escape.



     THREE SHOT                                             283X19

     The CAMERA MOVES with the T.T., Weena and the Young
     Man as they are forced to retreat.



     AT ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                           283X20

     Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi
     into the chamber of horrors.

     One of the Morlocks spots the T.T., Weena and the
     Young Man.  He swings his whip.



     BACK TO THREE SHOT                                     283X21

     The CAMERA MOVES with them as vicious CRACKING
     WHIPS drive them back to the entrance of the
     feasting room.



     TWO SHOT                                               283X22

     The T.T. tries to protect Weena.  Suddenly a long
     lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils
     about the T.T.'s neck.  He drops his unlit torch
     and whirls in pain.

     Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of
     horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s
     shoulders.  Finally he grabs the whip from around
     his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free.



     AT THE ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                       283X23

     The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the
     Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from
     above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him,
     knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
     On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles
     away leaving the T.T. a prey to the battery of
     CRACKING WHIPS.  He crawls in pain into the
     chamber of horrors.



     GROUPSHOT INSIDE FEASTING ROOM                         283X24

     The T.T. comes to his feet among the Eloi.  The
     WHIPS HAVE STOPPED, then the silence is broken by
     the GROWL of approaching MORLOCKS.  Through the
     curtains, dark shapes swarm toward them.  Then
     suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his
     pocket.  A match flares!



     GROUP OF MORLOCKS                                      283X25

     In the glare of yellow light we see the leprous
     figures of blinded Morlocks, dropping their whips,
     shielding their eyes.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X26

     The T.T.'s hand with the burning match rapidly zooms
     into the center of the picture in a BLINDING FLASH
     turning the screen momentarily white, then yellow
     and red.  Then the CAMERA MOVES BACK indicating the
     Morlocks' retreat.  Slowly the normal colors
     reappear.



     BACK TO THE GROUP OF MORLOCKS                          283X27

     Regaining their sight in the darkness, they start
     to close in.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X28

     Followed by the Eloi the T.T. exits the feasting
     room and again lights a match.  A BLINDING FLASH
     starting from the flame as a center engulfs the screen,
     momentarily white again, then yellow, finally red.
     Once more the CAMERA RETREATS, then still seeing
     through the Morlocks' eyes the CAMERA ZOOMS CLOSE
     ON THE MATCH BOX and the scaley hand of a Morlock
     slaps all the matches except one to the floor.



     T.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29

     He lights his last match and moves forward, looking
     for his lost torch.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X30

     The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the
     light of the match his only weapon in keeping the
     Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and
     picks it up hurriedly.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31

     His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre-
     hension while he applies the dying match to the
     intended torch.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (muttering)
               Burn, will you!

     He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and
     lower without starting the wood.  In despair he
     turns to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Quick, something to burn!  It's
               my last match!



     BACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32

     As they are closing in.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33

     With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve
     of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds
     it out.



     BACK TO T.T.                                           283X34

     As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the
     cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the
     dead match.

     He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and
     in this hotter flame it begins to burn.  Once it
     starts he again attempts to make his way by blind-
     ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X35

     As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway,
     one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip
     strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand.



     A CORNER                                               283X36

     The torch rolls in and begins to sputter.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          283X37

     The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other
     Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the
     T.T.  As they face one another, the fight begins.

     Eloi below him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Weena, get the torch!



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X5

     Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena
     looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then
     turns searching for the flickering torch.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 351X6

     As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge.
     Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost
     falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs
     on until he can scramble up on ledge again.
     He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his
     head against the rock wall, finally throwing
     him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor-
     lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he
     had previously kicked rises to menace him from
     the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across
     cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor,
     trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon
     against the Morlocks.



     CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7

     He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.  He
     sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently
     too confused to move.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Go on!  Go on the
               steps!



     CLOSE SHOT - AT ROCK - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN             351X8

     Weena spots the still flickering torch and
     starts toward it.



     INSERT OF TORCH                                        351X9

     Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends
     down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock
     appears facing her.  She screams and jumps back,
     watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward
     her.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X10

     The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several
     Morlocks converging on him.  He tries to fight his
     way past them.



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X11

     Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her
     over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting
     Cave.



     MED. SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                             351X12

     JUMPS up on ramp, kicks back at Morlocks - sees
     Morlock carrying Weena - JUMPS through Morlocks
     and runs toward her.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X13

     The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away
     from Morlock, knocks him against rock.  In the
     meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and
     jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down.
     The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps
     on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him.



     CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                            351X14

     Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for
     help.



     CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN                                 351X15

     Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the
     Time Traveller's silent plea for help.  Slowly
     raises his right hand, stares at it as he
     gradually clenches it into a fist.  Then, making
     up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor-
     lock hard on the back of his neck.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X16

     As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller
     kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs
     to get his torch.  Several Morlocks try to herd
     Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the
     Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the
     Eloi resist them.  The Time Traveller runs back
     in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X17

     The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs
     pushing Weena ahead of him.  They climb up past
     Cauldron.  Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi,
     shielding their eyes from the light of the Time
     Traveller's torch.



     CLOSER SHOT                                            351X18

     The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the
     Eloi are all on their way out.  Then turns back
     and drops his torch into the oil flowing into
     the Cauldron.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X19

     The burning torch catches the Cauldron on
     fire, which quickly spreads across the floor
     of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on
     the right, which explodes.  The Time Traveller
     herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X20

     Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of
     burning Cauldron hiding his face from the
     flames.  He bumps into the Pipe coming down
     the wall, loses his balance and falls into
     the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher.



     PAN SHOT                                               351X21

     Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as
     fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine
     at same time as fire - and it explodes.  Morlock
     catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave.



     PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT                                 352

     Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena
     run toward a circle of light on the floor far
     ahead.



     CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE                           353

     Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light
     that comes straight down from above, and look
     up the shaft.  Smoke belches from the passage-
     way as he helps her start up the ladder and
     then he, himself, follows, clambering out of
     sight.



     IN THE WELL                                            354

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller
     climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.  The light
     becomes slowly brighter and he looks up.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        355

     Gradually the top of the well becomes visible
     through the swirling smoke.  The Young Man is
     peering down.  He reaches to help Weena and the
     Time Traveller.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       356

     Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with
     soot, near exhaustion.  Far below them red flames
     pierce through the smoke.  They each in turn grasp
     the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out
     of the well.



     EXT. THE WELL - MED. SHOT - (SUNSET)                   357

     As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the
     Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake
     of approval.

     The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs,
     carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the
     pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn-
     ing wood down in to the well.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       358

     The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites
     the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          359

     The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to
     the other wells.  The Young Man first, then the rest of
     the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches
     from the torch and dash for the various wells to
     duplicate the Time Traveller's action.



     VARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362

     Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of
     wells and dumping the fire below.



     TWO SHOT                                               363

     With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on
     with approval at the Eloi's work.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (SUNSET)                  364

     It is dotted with wells, each of which has been
     turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and
     smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing
     the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the
     surface of the Earth.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   365

     It falls with a CRASH to the ground and begins to
     spew smoke and flame into the undergrowth of the
     forest nearby.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -          366
     (SUNSET)

     Smoke drifts out of its windows.  The Eloi hurry
     out, led by the Man in White.  They stop and stare
     at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed
     below.



     EXT. THE BLAZING FOREST - (SUNSET) - (STOCK)           367-368

     The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through
     the smoke.  Several trees fall over, blazing.  LOW
     UNDERGROUND RUMBLING is heard.



     WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELLER                           369

     They start down the hill after the Eloi, seeking
     safety together.  Suddenly a DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE
     EARTH makes them pause and look o.s.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DUSK) - (MINIATURE)      370

     Then comes a SERIES OF TREMBLORS, each more powerful
     than the one before.  The earth shudders and the
     blazing forest begins to collapse.  It does
     not explode into the air.  Rather, the solid
     earth seems to give way so that the entire
     surface of the ground begins to fall into the
     subterranean chambers.



     ANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)                            371

     A section of the earth sheers away and falls
     in an ever widening rift.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   372

     As it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a
     belch of steam.



     BACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)                        373

     Leveled off by the earthquake.  There are no more
     flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or
     obelisks.  There is no movement -- only the
     flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by
     the gentle breeze.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          374

     Staring into the vast destruction.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                               375

     He holds her hand.  The CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY and
     we begin to hear the

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                 (calmly)
             The underworld of the Morlocks was
             gone...and so was the life of leisure
             for the Eloi.

     He looks o.s.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          376

     The Man in White, with others, approaches the group
     headed by the Young Man.  The two men look at each
     other, their gestures and expressions showing their
     joy at release from centuries of fear.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             From now on they would have to work
             to survive.  And looking at their
             faces, I somehow knew that they could
             start over again.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                       377

     He looks down to Weena and we HEAR:

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             Another night was coming, but this
             night no Eloi needed to fear.

     The CAMERA MOVES CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER who looks
     up in concern.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             But what of me? - I was imprisoned
             in a world in which I did not belong.

                                  DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                    378

     This is the same pool where the Time Traveller
     saved Weena's life.  The peaceful SOUND of the
     RUSHING STREAM is occasionally interrupted by a
     REMOTE RUMBLE of EXPLOSION from the earth below.

     There is no sign in the sky of old constellations,
     only the face of the full moon looks familiar.
     The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket,
     relaxes on the white sand, playing with the
     blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and
     WHISTLING "The Land Of The Leal".

     Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of
     the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands.
     She glances over to the Time Traveller.

                      WEENA
             Are you sorry?

     He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES.
     He turns.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Sorry? - Sorry for what?

                      WEENA
             That you have to stay.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (gazing into the night)
             Yes. - I am sorry because I could
             tell so much to the people of my
             own time... I could tell them about
             the happiness and sorrow the future
             has in store for them.  They could
             learn from it...or would they?

                      WEENA
             You don't want to stay, do you?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             It isn't that, but I don't fit here
             anymore than you would in my time.

                      WEENA
                 (a pause, and then)
             I would like to see your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, Girl, you wouldn't be very
             happy there.

                      WEENA
             Do you have someone like me -
             there?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No.  No one like you.  But there
             are friends who will miss me. - As
             a matter of fact, I'm probably late
             already.

                      WEENA
                 (stealing a glance,
                 then quietly)
             Women?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, men.
                 (teasing)
             There is a woman too, of course!
                 (noticing her disappointment,
                 he relents)
             She looks after my house for me.
             She is sixty-two years old. - Much
             older than you are.

     Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair
     into a new arrangement.

                      WEENA
                 (suddenly)
             How do they wear their hair?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Who?

                      WEENA
             The women in your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (after a thought)
             Up!

                      WEENA
             Up? - How?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (with awkward gesture)
             Like this.

                      WEENA
             Show me.

     The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his
     pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.



     WEENA - MED. SHOT                                      379

     The Time Traveller appears behind her.  He first
     hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair
     imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.  She
     smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face
     toward him.

                      WEENA
                 (innocently)
             Would I be pretty?

     The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his.
     He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes
     into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on
     his cheek.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (slowly)
             Yes...you would be.  More than
             pretty.
                 (his voice sinks to a whisper)
             I wish we could go back together,
             Weena, back to my own time...or to
             times before that when the world
             was young.  We could...

     EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.  They
     both look in the direction of the voices.



     EXT. HILL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)              380

     A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man
     in White, approach them, talking excitedly,
     pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just
     revealed by the rolling smoke.  The face is
     broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The
     panel is open.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381

     Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her,
     breaks into a run.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          382

     The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The
     Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze,
     then the Eloi follow them.



     EXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383
     (MATTE)

     The face is broken in half.  It is left with only
     a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the
     remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the
     sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins
     of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and
     gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time
     Traveller and Weena come through the charred
     bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop.



     THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384

     The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling
     smoke.  The flames, licking at the inside walls,
     have not yet reached the Machine.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT                     385

     He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket
     and bring forth the lever without which the Machine
     will not function.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (without
                    looking at her)
               Come, Girl!

     He walk, toward the panel.  Weena follow,
     hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to
     halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this,
     the Time Traveller enters.



     INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386

     Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time
     Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes
     in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands
     on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her
     radiant features.

     Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around
     as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and
     starts to fit the lever into place.



     REVERSE ANGLE                                          387

     The Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow
     starts sliding across his figure, moving more
     swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes
     with a CLANG.



     OUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388

     Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them
     and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.



     INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389

     The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles
     to open them.  From without he hears Weena's
     POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living
     presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is
     silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking,
     weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some-
     thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls
     around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the
     enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding
     them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into
     the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as
     he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and
     try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and
     smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling
     bodies.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390

     The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and
     finally grasps it.

     INSERT OF DIALS                                        404

     Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls
     over the instruments, followed by a burst of
     whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
     There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total
     darkness.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             405

     Passing back in time through his captivity beneath
     the lava.  He reels in the saddle, then coming
     from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.
     As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the
     daylight returns, we can see that his face is
     covered with perspiration.  He looks off to see:



     SERIES OF SHOTS - (ANIMATION, MINIATURE, SPLIT)        406

     (NOTE:  These shots seen previously are now printed
             backward.)

             The red hot lava withdraws through the         (a,b,c)
             street ruins and the great rents in the
             ground gulp it up quickly.  Out of the
             ruins building are molded and then
             atomic explosions in reverse flash
             across the screen.  The SOUND OF
             EXPLOSIONS, RUMBLING ETC.  IN REVERSE
             AND SPEEDED UP join the HUMMING of the
             Time Machine.

             alternately across the sky, gradually
             slowing.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 407

     INTERCUT his reaction to the previous scenes until
     he straightens and readjusts the lever.  The
     HUMMING DECREASES, then walls rise about him.
     Watching the dials, he carefully moves the lever.
     The flickers of the days and nights decelerate
     and, with a sudden pull, he halts the Time Machine.
     The HUMMING ABRUPTLY CEASES.



     INSERT:  DIAL                                          408

     It stops on:  "5 January 1900".



     INT. LABORATORY - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                  409

     The Time Machine has returned, but it is resting
     in the far corner of the room instead of in the
     spot where we originally saw it.

     In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain-
     fully from the Machine.  Then, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA,
     he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it.
     His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest
     on the clock.  It is "8:04".

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     PENDULUM CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                            410

     Now showing "9:22".  For a long while only its
     MONOTONOUS TICKING is heard. - A welcome change
     from the cacophony of time traveling.

     The CAMERA MOVES slowly to reveal the DINING ROOM
     where the five men, their meal finished, are
     sitting silently around the table.  Mrs. Watchett
     is quietly serving the liqueur.  The Time Traveller
     is puffing on his pipe.  Kemp is chewing on his
     cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation.

                         DR. HILLYER
               It is ridiculous!  Simply preposterous!

     Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly
     with the spoon which CLINKS loudly in the room's
     silence.  Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp
     from his brandy.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well, there's one thing I'll say
               for you, George.  You always could
               tell a good story.  Best adventure
               yarn I've heard for years.
                    (loudly)
               You're a truly fine inventor,
               George!

     He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a
     hiccup quickly puts a period to that.  Mrs. Watchett
     steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of
     brandy.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I'll turn down your bed for you!

     As she exits Kemp looks up.

                         KEMP
               Truthfully, where have you been
               for the past week?

     Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL
                    (voice of experience)
               Now, we shouldn't ask such questions,
               Walter.  It's not hard for a man to
               lose a week now and then.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling)
               I understand your doubt.  Take it
               as a lie if you wish.  Now that
               I'm back I scarcely believe it
               myself.
                    (a flash of memory)
               Except that...
                    (groping in pocket)
               ...here are the flowers Weena gave
               me.

     He places the blossoms on the table before Filby.
     They are actually less than a day old and fairly
     fresh.



     FILBY AND THE BLOSSOMS - CLOSE SHOT                    411

     As he picks them up to examine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               A present for you, David.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             412

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to Filby)
               You were always interested in
               botany. - Try to match them with
               any species known today.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          413

     As he looks up, puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I don't think I can.



     GROUP SHOT                                             414

     A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on
     the table, stands up, looks around and then down
     to Kemp.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Are you coming, Kemp.

     Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller.

                         KEMP
               It's getting late and you look
               exhausted.  You had better get
               some rest.

     Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and
     starts to leave.



     COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415

     The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down
     from the sky.  The front door opens letting out
     the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.
     They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping
     the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to
     leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage
     looking back to the Time Traveller who stands
     motionless in the doorway.

                         FILBY
               Goodnight, George.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416

     The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thank you, David, for being such
               a good friend - always.

     With this he turns and goes into the house, closing
     the door slowly.



     AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417

     Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,
     but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.
     Kemp thrusts his head from the window.

                         KEMP
               What do you think, Filby?

                         FILBY (after a pause)
               One thing is certain.  Those
               flowers couldn't have possibly
               bloomed in the winter-time.

                         HILLYER (in the b.g.)
               You don't really think that story
               was true?

     Filby reaches a decision.

                         FILBY
               Look, you chaps go on.  It's
               just a short walk home for me.

                         HILLYER (o.s.)
               Go on, driver!

     The WHIP CRACKS.



     THE DRIVEWAY                                           418

     As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing
     in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage
     disappears, then retraces his steps to the front
     door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then
     uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer.
     He steps back and looks off toward the:



     EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419

     No light shines through its windows.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          420

     He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the
     door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house.



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421

     The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters
     the fully lit room, looking for his friend.
     Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES
     ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at
     the doorway.



     DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422

     The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The
     pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is
     "9:30".



     FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423

     He calls into the darkness.

                         FILBY
               George!...

     No answer.  Then an odd HUMMING sound brings
     him to stiff attention.  The SOUND INCREASES in
     VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems
     to tremble.  Then a violent gust of wind blows
     open the door that leads to the laboratory.

     Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the
     corridor.



     AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                  424

     Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives
     and tries the door -- it is locked.  The NOISE
     is almost DEAFENING.  He puts his shoulder to
     the door and finally bursts it open.  At the
     very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly.
     He stops short, gazing aghast.



     THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.                        425

     The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING,
     leaving the present.

     Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the
     corner where we last saw the Time Machine.  It is
     not there!  The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner.
     Nor is it there!  A few sheets of paper whirl
     desolately in the center of the floor.



     CLOSE ON FILBY                                         426

     He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
     behind him.  Mrs. Watchett hurries in.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervous,
                    breathless)
               Oh, Mr. Filby...what...
                    (her eyes widen)

                         FILBY (with finality)
               He's gone!

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly
     approaches the center of the room.  Here, with
     squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the
     floor.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (to
                    Filby)
               There's something funny here, sir!

     Filby steps aside her to investigate.



     WHAT THEY SEE                                          427

     The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling
     the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the
     front of the sphinx.  They are scratched deep in
     the floor leading from the spot where the Machine
     was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory
     where it originally stood.  Here, not only its
     imprint, but also the color and finish of the
     floor is preserved.



     TWO SHOT                                               428

     They straighten.  Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby,
     puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I think I understand. - Look!



     LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                                 429

     Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint
     in the floor where the Machine first stood and
     explains.

                         FILEY (pointing)
               See the imprint?  This is where
               the Time Machine originally
               stood.
                    (he paces across to the
                    end of the grooves)
               But the Morlocks moved it.
               They dragged it across the lawn
               right into the sphinx...right
               here.
                    (turns and points)
               And Weena was standing there when
               he last saw her...the same space -
               in a different time. - So he moved
               back his heavy Machine from here,
               across the room, scratching this
               floor...
                    (indicating the grooves
                    that lead to the imprint)
               So that he can appear outside the
               sphinx again and help the Eloi
               build a new world...and build a
               new world of his own.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (faintly,
                    sentimentally)
               Where he left her!..

     Filby doesn't answer.  He looks about the labora-
     tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's
     arm and leads her from the room.  The MUSIC STARTS
     THE THEME:  "The Land Of The Leal".



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               430

     Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room.

               But it isn't like George. - To
               return empty handed.  To try to
               rebuild a civilization without
               a plan.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               He must have taken something
               with him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing.

     She looks around and discovers three empty spaces
     on the tightly packed book shelves.  She walks to
     them.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing except three books.

                         FILBY
               Which three books?

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I don't know. -- Is it important?

                         FILBY (smiles)
               No, I suppose not. - Only...what
               three books would you have taken?

     She looks at him, pondering the question as they
     leave the library.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL                                     431

     They stop at the door and Mrs. Watchett stands
     beside Filby as he opens it.  Outside the snow
     is falling softly.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Mr. Filby, do you think he will
               ever return?

                         FILBY (quietly)
               One cannot choose but wonder. -
               You see...he has all the time in
               the world!

     With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls
     the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into
     the night.  Mrs. Watchett looks after him.  She
     hears the SOUND of his DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS
     SQUEAKING in the virgin snow.  Slowly she closes
     the door.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)           432

     Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly
     as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses
     a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a
     path and starts walking the long way home.

                                            SLOW FADE OUT.



                          THE END

              EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

              A relatively modern village... for a remote jungle. Dawn is
              JUST barely beginning to break. The morning mist persists as
              we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a group
              of VILLAGERS.

              O
               N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her SON, 8, runs

          1
              to her side. She's mad. Her son cries.

          

                                                                          2.

          

          

          

                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        You monsters!
              UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES, greasy men, holding
              AK-47's, and looking down with hardened indifference. OS, we
              hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see-
              - COL. PANTERA. A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks
              up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her.

                                  PANTERA
                        We appreciate the generous donation
                        for the continued protection of
                        your village.
              ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's
              precious crops.
              WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe
              distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately
              LUNGES at Pantera, just as-
              -SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed
              at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans
              forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck.

                                  PANTERA
                        After all, the jungle can be a very
                        dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.
              They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING.

          

          

              EXT. JUNGLE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

              The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits
              in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the
              food. The Jungle looms ominous around them.

              H
               IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling
              high above... as if from someone's POV.
              ON DRIVER - He suddenly reacts to a fallen tree on the road
              ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around.

                                  PANTERA
                        Idiota! Watch where you're going!

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        There's a log on the road, senor.
                            (quietly to himself)
                        ...that wasn't there an hour ago.

                                   PANTERA
                        Well, what are you waiting for?!

                        REMOVE IT!
                            (to soldiers behind)
                        Cortez! Andelay!

          CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep
          and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away.
           EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus
          bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene!

                               CORTEZ (O.S.)
                    ...yirk!
          ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.

                              DRIVER SOLIDER
                        (softly, nervous)
                    D-d-dios mio.
          ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.

                              PANTERA
                    What?! WHAT IS IT?!
          OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as
          the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY
          SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck.
          Before he can react...
          - YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on
          the ground HARD.

                                URLY SOLDIER

                    OOF!
          Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into...
          the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.
          ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the
          back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. "Last" jumps out and
          readies his machine gun.

                              PANTERA
                        (to Jungle)

                    WHO ARE YOU?! SHOW YOURSELF!!

                    ...The Ghost of the Jungle.

                               PANTERA
                    What?!

                              DRIVER SOLDIER

                           (
                         shaking/nervous)
                    The jungle god that punishes those
                    who prey upon the weak.
                        (looks scared to Pantera)
                    He's coming... for us.

              OS NOISE - Suddenly hear the whooshing of 4 quick punches,
              kicks, a short machine gun burst and a WHUMP. Pantera and
              Driver look to the ground.
              ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor.

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        I'm sorry, senor.
              Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the
              jungle. CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in bg.

                                  PANTERA

                        COWARD!! GET BACK HERE!!
              Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look.
              Nothing. He reaches down and pulls up... a MACHETE.

                                  PANTERA

                        SHOW YOURSELF! DO YOU REALIZE WHO

                        YOU'RE DEALING WITH?!
              ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying
              to find him. Tense. Suddenly-
              -a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him!
               n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end
              of a flurry of fist and foot attacks. His attacker is moving
              way too fast for the camera to keep up.
              Pantera falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off
              into the dense Jungle!
              ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked.

              An oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete-
              clutching brute. He stumbles, then stands in the middle.

                                    ANTERA
                        I am not afraid of a myth!

                        Actually... it's "Turtle", pal.
              Pantera swings around. Eyes wide.
               N ATTACKER - We pan up the thick green legs. Muscular and
              strong. Further up. Arms to match. Rough skin. It wears a
              shorn HOODED PONCHO. Inside are two white eyes and gritted
              smiling teeth.
              The poncho falls to the ground.

          

                                                                       5.

          

          

          
              ON ATTACKER - It's LEONARDO! Beaten blue bandana blowing in
              the breeze. Total hero shot. He pulls out a SINGLE KATANA
              SWORD, poised for battle. Pantera's backed into a corner.

                                  PANTERA
                        Let's see if a ghost can die, then.
              Pantera SCREAMS and runs to Leo and starts swinging! At the

              The Boy is still at the Village Clearing. Suddenly -
              - the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the distance! The
              villagers panic and scatter. VROOM! The Jeep flies out of the

              Only there is no one driving it... and it still has the
              stolen food in it. And the stolen medallion dangles from the
              rear view mirror.

                        It's a miracle!
              The village rejoices. The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks
              back at the Jungle. Something catches his eye.
              ...a small crouched figure on a tree branch. Barely
              silhouetted. His white eyes lit in the darkness. One of them
              WINKS as the boy smiles.

              Leo leaps into frame. He takes out his katanas and lays them
              carefully on the ground. He KNEELS, head bowed, eyes closed.

              The camera lifts away from Leo... and then PLUNGES into the

              The music is in full tilt as the camera travels through

              EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT                             9

              A mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps.
              It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...
              - BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera,
              tearing off into the distance.

                                  NYPD #1 (O.S.)

                        FREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT!
              Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD
              OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit -
              hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
              doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
               ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.

                                  MUGGER
                        Heh, heh... suckers.
              ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
              a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads,
              aiming directly for Mugger!

                                   MUGGER
                        Whaaa!!!
              The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
              all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
              and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by
              the collar in mid-stride!

                                  MUGGER
                        You crazy?! Put me down, man!
              But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without
              stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into
              every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue!

                                  MUGGER

                        OW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF!
              Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole... Driver
              veers left! He drags the Mugger into...

               EXT. DEAD END ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Driver tosses him onto the ground at full speed. Mugger
               SLIDES down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage
               like he's a human bowling ball.
               ON HEAD OF ALLEY - The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a
               ton of dust and racket, peeling donuts at mouth of the alley.
               And then he stops. Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates.

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!
               The Driver gets off the bike. Silence. Backlit by headlight.
               He walks directly to the Mugger with purpose. Mugger starts
               to really freak out. Driver picks him up by the collar and
               SLAMS him to the back WOODEN FENCE WALL.

                                   MUGGER
                         P-p-please. Don't kill me, man.
               Driver just cocks his head. Mugger can see his own terrified
               reflection his Driver's black visor. Driver reaches behind
               his back and pulls out a COMBAT KNIFE! He reels back and...

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!

               W
                HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET,
               PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather the
               purse's belongings at the mouth of the alley.
                fter he stops cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of
               the wall. Driver doesn't notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls
               the knife at the Driver!
               THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK!
                N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO WIDE as Driver
               slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as Driver
               moves toward him... and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side.
               ON WALL SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and
               throws as Driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to
               be taught a lesson. An OS Police Siren chirps.
               MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries
               flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.

               ON MUGGER - Hung upside down by a chain. Purse hangs from his
               neck. He'll live, but never commit another crime again...

               WIDER - A quieter area of the city. Broken by the squealing
               of the bike as Driver (Nightwatcher) roars in to a stop.
               Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off
               his helmet. Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-

               - RAPHAEL, THE RED-MASKED NINJA TURTLE!
               He reaches back and pulls out the KNIFE from his SHELL. Looks
               at it, shaking his head and grinning. He sheathes it.

               Headlight comes to life. Lets the clutch out.

               with the surrounding danger.

                         do I do? WHAT DO I DO?!
               Mikey's eyes continue to panic. DONATELLO's voice comes in
               over a RADIO. Calming.

               The cam pulls out of a LARGE MASCOT HEAD - looks like a big
               goofy Turtle head with googly eyes and dumb smile. WIDER we
               see a fake ZIPPER spirit-glued onto Mikey's plastron. In his

               ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a
               toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then-
               throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids

               Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake
               zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head.
               His trademark orange bandana spills out.
               He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat
               until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance.
               Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car
               whizzes by.
               WIDER - the van takes off down the street.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - LATER

               CLOSE ON - a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic
               light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS
               Left. Reacts.
               OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's
               behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a
               ventriloquist to "hide" his identity. Don follows on a small
               surveillance cam under the rearview mirror.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         All's I'm saying Donnie is that no
                         one would notice if YOU did one of
                         these gigs every now and again.

                         But you add such... panache to the
                         character.
               Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode. He
               rubs his sore neck.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Well, if panache is French for
                         "punching bag", I'd have to agree
                         with ya.

               A darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's,
               monitors and TV tubes. Cables run everywhere. In front of
               them is DONATELLO - our resident tech-head turtle.

               ON CAR - The Man is still looking - only now really freaked
               out - at the fully animated Mikey head.

                         Aw nuts.
               Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
               frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly
               waves back.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         Traffic's clear eastbound for two
                         blocks. Then hook up with route J.
               BACK WITH MIKEY - He's still waving with a frozen smile.

               Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and
               antics at the Man! Before the man can react, Mikey TEARS OUT
               and zips across traffic down a deserted side-street.
               ...as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering

               The van parks in a long-forgotten alleyway. A dummy gate
               closes behind it, obscuring it from view.
               UNDER THE VAN - We see it's parked over a manhole cover. It
               slowly slides shut.

               The dripping concrete and metal maze explodes with the
               cacophony of Mikey riding his skateboard, backpack in tow.

               But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's
               skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training. He
               jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles
               with all four limbs. A fun rock n' roll sequence.
               Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he
               arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a
               BRICK DUMMY WALL that brings him to...

               Mikey lands in the "foyer" of sorts. Atop entrance stairs. He
               kicks the double doors open.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Honeeeeey! I'm hooome!
               As Mikey slides down the banister, the cam dollies around

               I
               behind him revealing the LAIR. Breathtaking to fresh eyes.
                t has a wonderful lived-in feel - they're not squatters...
               they've made this their HOME. Furniture is jury-rigged and
               the place is custom lit to provide the right kind of
               atmosphere. If we looked behind the surface detail, we'd see
               a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the entire lair.
               Donatello runs up to Mikey. Mikey robotically hands him the
               wad of money from the party.

               As Donnie walks away, Mikey LOUDLY CLEARS HIS THROAT. Don
               stops as Mikey holds out his hand. Don's busted - he peels
               off a few bills and hands Mikey his share.

                         Domo arigato, dude.
               Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa. Hits a
               remote as a BIG SCREEN lights up in front of him. Suddenly-

                                   SPLINTER (O.S.)

                         MICHAELANGELO!
               Mikey springs from the couch. Snaps to obedience.

                         Yes, sensei.
               ANGLE ON - SPLINTER the Japanese rodent master and father of
               the TMNT. He is well-kempt, still walks with a cane, and has
               the same sparkle in his eye. He approaches Mikey. Silent.

                                   SPLINTER
                             (a beat)

                         Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter.
               Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece
               of BIRTHDAY CAKE. Splinter lights up.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Ahh! Butter creme frosting!
               Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Master. No cake. You remember your
                         last cholesterol tests.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But I-
                             (changes attitude)
                         -Donatello! I am your Master!

                                   DONATELLO
                         Nice try, sensei. But you can still
                         be my Master... with low
                         cholesterol.
               Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away,
               Michaelangelo reaches into his bag and secretly passes
               Splinter a smaller wrapped piece.

                                   SPLINTER
                         He-heh. You have done well, my son.
               Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it - FILLED with
               dozens of other pieces of Birthday Cake leftovers. He tosses
               it with the rest.                                  C

                         Talk to me.

                                   APRIL
                         Hey. It's me. I'm back.
               Casey rubs his face, tries to orient himself. Looks at watch.

                                   CASEY
                         Was that today, babe?
               April's disappointed. Same old Casey.

          

               O

                                    APRIL
                         Yes. It was today that I returned
                         to you after being in a deadly
                         jungle for almost a month.

                             (BEAT)
                         I thought you were going to meet me
                         down here?

                                   CASEY
                         I'm sorry, babe. I must've-

                                   APRIL
                         Forget it. I'll take a cab.
               A long pause on the phone. Casey knows he's busted.

                                   CASEY
                         I missed you?
               April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in
               his chair, shaking his head.

                                   CASEY
                         Good goin', Case.
               Back at the dock, April is back to business.

                                   APRIL
                         Howie! Get this on the truck for
                         delivery! Let's go!
               P.O.V. INSIDE BOX - See April through the wood slats. We'd
               swear we almost hear... LOW GROWLING.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Mikey is on his bed. His thumbs pound away at a video game on
               TV - bored. He puts down the controller and yells to the
               ceiling.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         I'M! BORED!!!!!
               He stands up and walks to DON'S ROOM. He opens it. It takes
               only one foot until the door is pushed up against piles of
               TECH JUNK. Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open.
                N DON - He's hunched over a work table, back to Mikey.
               Tinkering as always. Wild inventions line the walls, some
               finished, some not. Some pay tribute to past TMNT adventures.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Don, y'ever feel like you were
                         meant for more? To DO more? Like, I
                         mean, sometimes I feel like...

                              MICHAELANGELO(cont'd)
                    like we never really left that
                    glass turtle bowl when we were
                    little dudes.
          REVERSE ANGLE - Don lifts his head up, eyes MAGNIFIED in some
          bizarre head contraption. He flips up side panels,
          ELECTRONICA MUSIC blares out.

                               ONATELLO
                    Oh, hi Mikey. You say something?

                              MICHAELANGELO
                        (sighs - to himself)
                    Every day it's the same thing. Wake
                    up. Birthday party gig. Drive home.
                    Watch TV. Train... Rinse. Repeat.

                              DONATELLO
                    I know. Isn't it great?
          A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING
          ROOM SOFA. He and the camera think he's alone, but before he
          knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged,
          still, and sipping tea.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    WAH!!

                              SPLINTER
                    Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an
                    indicator of your surroundings. It
                    is a reflection of your inner
                    heart. Fill yourself with
                    excitement on the inside... and
                    you'll live the most rewarding life
                    of all.
          Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan. A beat. Then returns to
          flipping channels. He stops on a NEWS program - "NYC DIRT".

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)
                    And so yet again, police officials
                    are baffled at a crime of
                    retribution that can only be
                    attributed to the mysterious figure
          M         known as "The Nightwatcher".
           ikey lights up. On TV is a flashy well-coifed, know-nothing
          REPORTER. Beside him is a news photo of the tied up MUGGER
          from our second scene.

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER
                    This is the latest in a string of
                    vigilante acts that have been
                    plaguing the city for the past
                    year.

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER(cont'd)
                    Although the victims have been
                    criminals themselves, the
                    Nightwatcher's actions have been
                    identified as destructive and
                    overly-violent... verging on the
                    edge of lethal.
          ON MIKEY - Can't smile wide enough. He runs to his room,
          returns with a POLAROID CAMERA. He snaps a picture of the TV.
          He pulls it out, placing it in his NIGHTWATCHER SCRAPBOOK,
          overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the
          vigilante.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!
                    Cruising the streets, busting those
                    who hold themselves above the law.
                        (movie announcer voice)
                    But they aren't above HIS.
          Don walks in, holding an in-process invention. He looks up.

                              DONATELLO
                    Mikey, the man's practically a
                    criminal himself. Anyone who
                    operates without boundary or rule
                    of law cannot be legislated and
                    needs to be reigned in.

                              RAPHAEL (O.S.)
                    Sounds like four turtles I used ta
                    know.
          ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where
          in sight.

                               RAPHAEL
                    Whatta we talkin' about, boys?
                    Soundin' a little too egghead fer
                    my tastes.

                               PLINTER
                    Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I
                    were just discussing the vigilante
                    Nightwatcher once again.
                        (beat - concerned)
                    Where have you been? You've been
                    spending so much time away from
                    home lately...
          Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already.
          His attention doesn't break from Donatello.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I joined a book a' the month club.

          Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.

                              DONATELLO
                    I have no problem with the
                    incarceration of those who deserve
                    it, but if someone like
                    Nightwatcher has ultimate power...
                    then who makes sure he doesn't
                    cross the line?
          Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS, twirling them around
          aggressively in mock battle.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I think he's COOL.

                              DONATELLO
                    Of course you would.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    Keeya! HATCHAAAAAA!!

                              RAPHAEL
                    Sometimes there are lines that even
                    the police can't cross. Someone has
                    to be willing to do what needs to
                    be done. And to do that, fear
                    becomes a weapon.

                              DONATELLO
                    You are such a Neanderthal.
          Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick
          and startled, eyes wide.

                                APHAEL
                    I rest my case.

                    Raphael! If bullying is the only
                    way to argue your point, then
                    perhaps you do not have much of a
                    point to begin with.

                               APHAEL
                        (gritted teeth)
                    Yes, sensei.
                        (to Mikey)
                    And quit touchin' my stuff.
          Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms
          out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the
          second floor.

          

                                                                          20.

                         That was just a startle response
                         and isn't really an indication of
                         fear!
               Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his
               room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC...
               ...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song.

                                   RAPHAEL (O.S.)

                         AAAARGH! AND STOP TOUCHING MY

                         STEREO TOO, MIKEY!!!
               Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A
               silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of Raph's room.
               Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two.

                         It's an involuntary thing your body

                             (no response)
                         What? It's true.

               A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels
               fold out under the carriages.
               CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the
               city glow in front of him. He jumps off as - FOOMP! - a HANG-
               GLIDER opens up from his backpack. He lowers the glider to

               Disgusting. Dripping. Out of the slime, Leo rises. A beat...

               All is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only
               light source. Mikey snores and drools on the couch, covered

               magazine over his face... gadget-in-process in his lap.
               ON ENTRANCE - Leo walks in and places his bag on the floor.
               The place feels different... but still feels like home.

               Leo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting
               him. Kneeling on the floor. Very serious.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Enter.
               Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I have completed my training,
                         master. I am prepared for the next
                         stage.

                                   SPLINTER
                         That you are, my son. You must now
                         apply all that you have learned on
                         your lengthy journey to your
                         everyday life. THAT will be the
                         most challenging training of all...
                plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION.
               Leo is touched.
               CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES,
               watching the entire scene... jealous.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I've missed you, Leonardo.

               L
                eo hugs Splinter.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I've missed you too, father.

                                   SPLINTER
                         I'm afraid much has changed in your
                         brothers' spirits since you have
                         left. But now that you are home,
                         they will finally have the ethical
                         and warrior leadership they have
                         been lacking. The family needs you.
               ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei.

          ON OUTSIDE OF ROOM - Raphael walks out of the shadows. He's
          good... but not too good for Splinter. Splinter and Leo break
          and face the doorway. An awkward silence.

                                  LEONARDO

                       So... congratulations.

                       Well, I'm goin' to bed.
          He leaves.
          TV ROOM - Raph walks through the room, cuffs Don on the back
          of the head, and keeps on walking.

               It was all a nightmare. We go WIDER as we take in the
               ostentatious bedroom of MAXIMILIAN WINTERS, a young mid-40's.
               Famous NYC entrepreneur.
                inters is large, handsome, built and powerful in every
               sense. His bedroom reflects it as well - large simple shapes,
               decorated with a modern-day tribal/tech appeal. This guy is
               filled with adrenaline, power and machismo.

               Rock/hip-hop music crashes in as we see Winters' morning
               workout - a combination of weaponry work (martial arts and
               others), floor routines and bag work. He takes it all very
               seriously.
               Sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a Mook Jung
               training block with his bare fist. He walks out of the room,

               He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING -
                 Winters Office is an "elevator" of sorts that can ride up
               and down the front of the building, allowing him access to
               any floor of his Tower without leaving his desk.

               Manhattan - complete with it's own front Central Park-ish
               gated entry. A true work of modern architecture.

               The mask is pushed aside by Casey - Kid 1 was holding it.

          WIDER - Casey is with 5 other KIDS prepping for a game of
          STREET HOCKEY, using tennis balls and trash cans. Chubbier
          KID 2 walks by and grabs the mask himself.

                              KID 2
                    Whatever! Let's get it on!
          They begin a boisterous round of hockey. Trash talk, gentle
          checking and all the requisite boy things. We see that the
          kids love Casey. And vice versa. Suddenly-

                              BROOKLYN MOM (O.S.)

          Tommy's defeated. Looks at the disappointed boys.

                              TOMMY
                    Sorry dudes.

                              CASEY

                        (face falls, disappointed)
                    ...oh no.
          OFF HIS LOOK - We see APRIL, dressed stunning in a dark
          business suit at the other side of the street. She's dangling
          a WHITE SHIRT and a TIE from her other hand.

                               ASEY
                    Aw, c'mon April! We just started!
          April just gives him "the look" with an eyebrow cock. Casey
          knows he can't win.

                              KID 2
                    Can't Casey stay and play for just
                    five more minutes, Miss O'Neil?

                    Awwwww! Man! Baaah!
          Casey hands his stick, then quickly turns with a grin.

               CAM FOLLOWS April and Casey as they walk down the street.
               April's not really a hard-ass - she's just forced to be the
               "responsible one" in A

                         Heh-heh... yeah.
               Casey awkwardly places his arm over her shoulder as the cam
               rests and they walk into the distance. He pulls it back down.

               The doors open in Winters Lobby. April struts in, owning the
               place. Casey struggles pulling the pallet holding the LARGE

               trophies adorn the walls, as do SUITS OF ARMOR from all time
               periods and random strange ARTIFACTS spanning history in
               glass cases.
               Winters sits at his large desk as the large doors open and
               April and Casey spill in.

               He shakes her hand and double-cheek kisses her. Casey's eyes
               widen - is THIS what his girlfriend does?

                    So how was your trip?

                    You know, the typical - corrupt
                    government officials, double
                    crossed by a jungle guide, all
                    ending in a heart-pounding chase.
          Winters and April chuckle. Cam adjusts to show Casey between
          them in the bg, looking uncomfortable and out of place.

          Winters BEAMS, way too excited as well. April holds out her
          hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants. He awkwardly
          HIGH FIVES her.

          He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks
          open the front panel.
          INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK
          - the front panel falls to the floor.

                         But I have to ask... why the
                         fascination with these particular
                         works of art? I'd never even heard
                         of the Legend of Yaotl until we
                         met.

               -the armor becomes the back of a HELMET. Camera dollies
               around the helmet until we're looking at a dark and imposing
               figure. YAOTL. His helmet is impenetrable, with eye slits.
               Note - the flashback is dark, shadowed and monochromed.
               Detail is hinted at instead of shown. Very stylized.

                         It was a time long before the
                         Mayans, April. Long before the
                         Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was
                         a time of legends. A time of
                         greatness. The true mother culture
                         of Central America.

                         There was a man named Yaotl. More a
                         force of nature than man. And
                         together with his Four Warrior-
                         Priest Generals, they pillaged
                         every culture in their path.
               QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl.
               Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their
               distinct armor as the Four Stone Generals - in human form.

                    gathering more power and knowledge
                    with each conquest.
          GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally
          stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons
          are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS.

                                WINTERS (V.O.)
                    Then they came across a culture
                    rich with science, magic and their
                    own technology. A South American
                    version of "Atlantis".

                          BEAT)
                    It was like blood in the water for
                    a predator like Yaotl.
          CLOSE ON - Yaotl. As he raises his sword in the air. CAM
          DOLLIES AROUND HIS HEAD REVEALING their opposing forces. An
          army of THOUSANDS. Waving their weapons in the air.
          The opposing army CHARGES. Yaotl's men pull out   a large
          ORNAMENTAL STAND - a "stargate" of sorts. Yaotl   and his men
          are unmoving... as they begin a ceremony. Yaotl   looks to the
          heavens above - as we see a CLUSTER OF SPECIFIC   STARS move
          into place.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    As the army approached, Yaotl used
                    the knowledge they'd gained in
                    black magic and sorcery. Timing
                    their attack with the alignment of
                    the Stars of Kikin, they opened a
                    portal to another world.
          ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit
          by the OS portal. Don't know what to expect -
          ON PORTAL - A crackling electric circle opens to another
          dimension. Suddenly - DOZENS OF MONSTERS EXPLODE OUT!
          Creatures of all varieties. Gnashing Fangs. Swiping claws.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    They unleashed an army of monsters.
           N BATTLEFIELD - men getting slaughtered (in a nice PG sort
          of way). Quick shots. Intense.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    The monsters knew no side   - they
                    destroyed the enemy... as   well as
                    Yaotl's own army. Men who   swore to
                    spill their blood for his   cause.
                    Yaotl had to do something   to stop
                    more from coming through.

                         In the end, there were no victors.
                         And they were responsible for the
                         eradication of the greatest culture
                         that will never be known. The
                         knowledge that was lost would never
                         be found again...

               Casey has fallen asleep, sitting to the side, head in his
               hand. A line of DROOL hangs from his mouth. April is
               fascinated by the story. She nudges Casey who does the

               dangerously close to the vase.

               Winters is still alone in his office. Still studying the
               statue. A beat. He turns his head to the side.

               INT. DARK CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Another place that isn't the TMNT lair. Dark and mysterious.
               Don't know where we are. Feels ceremonial. We see close up
               detail of statue GRANITE.
               A DEEP VOICE chants OS in a South American tongue as HIGH-
               TECH GEAR is placed on the rock. It becomes powered,
               triggering a reaction in the stone itself.
               Music builds as we see quick shots of the granite cracks
               GLOWING RED. Camera travels with the rising glow.
               End on a pair of DEAD EYES - suddenly come to life. Red glow.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               The boys stand high atop the city below. Readying to run a
               gauntlet of rooftop hazards. They spy a BILLBOARD off in the
               distance.            M

               Leo and Raph glare at each other.

                         Deal.

                         Actually, I think you and I should
                         pair up, Mikey.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         You kiddin' me?! I mean, no offense
                         Donnie, but you ain't exactly the
                         biggest hitter on the bench.

          Don is grinning. Observing the subtle tension.

                              DONATELLO
                    Just trust me on this one.
          Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on
          buildings. The course requires them to work as a TEAM,
          throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle
          to obstacle.
          Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick
          wall. Raph, convinced Leo did it on purpose, uses his next
          opportunity to hurl Leo dangerously high and far over a
          billboard. The situation escalates at each juncture.

                              LEONARDO
                    Have you been avoiding me? Barely
                    seen you since I got home.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I been busy.

                              LEONARDO

                        (SARCASTIC)
                    I see. So... you're definitely not
                    upset at me or anything, right?

                              RAPHAEL
                    Why'd you think that?

                              LEONARDO
                    I don't know... your brother gets
                    to go on a world-wide training
                    mission and you have to stay home.
                    Might upset me too.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Are you trying to make me mad?

                              LEONARDO
                    I'm just saying, I'd understand if
                    you were upset.
          Their intensity ESCALATES.

                              RAPHAEL
                    You wouldn't understand the first
                    thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!.
           hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop
          rolling, continue fighting.

                              LEONARDO
                    Is that what this is about? You
                    think Splinter likes me best?

                              RAPHAEL
                    You'd love that, wouldn't you?

               WIDER - Don and Mikey are already sitting there.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         So nice of you to join us,
                         gentledudes.

                         And by the way, I prefer the
                         classic military corner tuck for my
                         bedsheets.

               M
                ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren't amused. They
               stare down. Raph does his BULLY FLINCH fake-lunge... only Leo
               doesn't twitch. Suddenly-

                                   MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                         Whoa! Whawazzat?!
               The others rush over to the edge with Mikey.

                                    ICHAELANGELO
                         You dudes see that up there?
               OFF HIS LOOK - We see LARGE SHADOWS moving with in a large I-
               BEAM CONSTRUCTION SITE. The movement is coming from one of
               the higher floors.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         So what now, captain?

                                   LEONARDO
                         We need to come up with a plan.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Later!
               Raph RUNS OFF toward the action.

                                   LEONARDO

                         RAPH!!!
               But Raph doesn't stop. All three look at each other. Then-

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Welcome home.

          

          

               EXT. I-BEAM HIGHRISE CONSTRUCTION


          48                                                                48
               The boys cross over on a large CONSTRUCTION CRANE and scale
               up the few more stories to the top. They stand on a scaffold
               underneath the floor of the activity.
               ON WALL - Deep CLAW MARKS are carved into the steel, much
               like by April and Casey's loft. Don notices.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Guys, I've got a bad feeling...

                              RAPHAEL
                    Ahh, let's take a tiny peek.
          They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Well, there's a good/bad news
                    scenario for ya.
          CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Good news is that there are a
                    buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot
                    kicked out of `em.
          CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI
          squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses
          them around like stuffed animals.

                               ICHAELANGELO (O.S.)
                    Bad news is WHAT's kickin' the snot
                    out of `em...
          ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner
          of the floor. A FOOT NINJA gets clobbered and sails past
          them, and off the building. (safely to a scaffold below)

                               D

                               ONATELLO
                    An interesting conundrum. Do we
                    hold dear the value of life and
                    help the Foot regardless of our
                    tumultuous past?

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I vote for sitting back and
                    enjoying the show.
                        (to Leo)
                    Whaddaya say, leader boy?
          ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of "leader" shouldered.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Nah. We kick butt.
          Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles
          jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the
          Bigfoot Monster is confused as well.
          ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai.

                               EONARDO
                    Who are YOU?!
          ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana
          attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this
          opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks
          back at the Turtles...

          

          R

          The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the
          structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it,
          not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below!
           aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature! The
          boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper
          trouble.
          The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact.
          The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many
          flights of floors.
          Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the
          building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom
          floor to await the others.
          SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Nice of ya's ta join me.
          But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the
          Creature closes in-

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    YEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!!
          The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    What? I saw it on a nature show
                    once.
          The creature SCREAMS BACK! Boys freak out.

                              TURTLES

                    AAAAAAGGHHHHH!!!!!

          A
           NGLE ABOVE TURTLES - As a large teetering pallet filled with
          dried cement and blocks to come CRASHING DOWN ON THEM! The
          Turtles are buried under the rubble.
          RUH? - The Creature is confused... until it's hit with a
          blinding light, and then an EXPLOSION - FWOOM! We hear heavy
          footsteps thumping through the light. Shapes start to form
          until we see...
          ...LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH
          TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings.
          Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through
          their stone cracks and piercing eyes.
          The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape-
          themed costume ("MONO"), Eagle Leader ("AGUILA"), agile
          Jaguar ("GATO") and the deadly snake-like female
          ("SERPIENTE"). Large. Imposing. Completely bad-ass.
          The Creature ROARS and FIGHTS to no avail...

          

                                                                         41.

          

          

          
               BURIED POV - Silent. The Turtles start to GROAN, regaining
               consciousness. Moonlight shoots in as they move the rock and
               stand up, groggy.
               ON MOUTH OF ALLEY - Through the smoke we can see silhouettes -
               a large hairy shape, along with FOUR VERY LARGE SHAPES. The
               sounds of freighter doors CLOSING, engines revving and then a
               caravan of sorts pulling away.
               WHOOOOOP! - A POLICE SIREN chirps. Approaching the now-
               destroyed site.

                                   DONATELLO
                         Better hit the tunnels, guys.
               Donnie uses a small prod to prop open a MANHOLE COVER. Don,
               Mike and Leo jump in. Leo looks back, Raph is still stewing.

                                    LEONARDO
                         Raph. Save it for another day.

                             (BEAT)

                         RAPH!
               Raph knows he has to go. Reluctantly he enters the sewer. The
               lid closes as the alley is illuminated by POLICE CHERRIES.

               A
                 beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek.

                         Y'know, it's not that bad, dudes.
               ON BUILDING - Actually, the place is destroyed. Dented, torn
               and looking like a post-night raid in WWII.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               UP ANGLE on the Tower. Dead of night. No one around.

          

          

               INT. WINTERS TOWER SECRET CELL BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS


          50                                                               50
               A cavernous structure. Dimly lit. High ceiling. A few odd
               silhouettes here and there.
               We hear the clicking of Winters' shoes echo as he enters.

                                   WINTERS
                         What seems to be the problem?
               Karai and six Ninja are already there.

                                   KARAI
                         The "problem" is that we were hired
                         to merely patrol the city and
                         report anything "strange" to you.

                              KARAI(cont'd)
                        (grabs sword hilt)
                    You never said anything about

                    MONSTERS.
          Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take
          the lion. He reaches to a satchel on the floor. The Foot
          TENSE in anticipation. Instead... Winters comes up with a

          MONEY BRICK.

                               INTERS
                        (tosses money brick)
                    So, your job duties were just
                    redefined. Congratulations on your
                    promotion.
          SHINK! - Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid-
          air. Winters STOPS and looks back over his shoulder.

                              KARAI
                    We may be hired help to you, but
                    you should never forget... we are
                    the Foot Clan.
          ON WINTERS - Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'.

                              WINTERS
                    Oooooooh...
          It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving
          toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at
          Winters throat!
          ...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH.
          Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the
          shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS.
          They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of
          it all.
          The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and
          unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.

                               WINTERS
                    I believe we made a deal, Karai. I
                    expect you to honor it.
                         (beat, stares her down)
                    You do understand "honor", don't
                    you?
          Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.

                              WINTERS
                    So I don't care what part of
                    "muscle for hire" you don't
                    understand. I hired your muscle.
                    Now exercise the ones attached to
                    your feet and...
                        (closer - terse)
                    ...get back to work.

          

                                                                    43.

          

          

          
          Karai slowly steps back. Winters smiles wide, reaches into
          the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to

                               W
          a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.

                               INTERS
                    So I will double... no, no...
                    TRIPLE your pay for your troubles.
                        (stare down)
                    Are we cool?
          ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably
          seething inside. Winters is flanked by Generals.

                              WINTERS
                    Are we... cool?
          The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.

                              WINTERS
                    Ninjas. No sense of humor.
                        (to Generals)
                    So how did we fare?
          CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is
          wheeled into the light.
          Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
          pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the
          HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.

                              WINTERS
                        (close, quiet)
                    So it begins...
          It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.
          Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw.
          Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He
          merely grins at the creature.

                              WINTERS
                        (to General Aguila)
                    Were there any problems?
          AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over
          Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.

                              GENERAL AGUILA
                    None, my lord.

                              WINTERS
                        (to Karai)
                    You see, now THAT'S a good soldier.
                    You two should compare notes.
          Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not
          used to being handled like this.

          

                              K

          

          

          

          

                                                                  44.

          

          

          

                              KARAI
                    Just what is this all about?

                              WINTERS
                    Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt.
                        (re: Generals)
                    I now have the power and know-how,
                    but I need the speed and stealth of
                    an organization such as your own.
                    Not to mention an organization that
                    values discretion.

                              KARAI
                    But of course.

                              WINTERS
                    You see, I have nine more beasts
                    like this that should be coming to
                    town very soon. Thirteen in all, to
                    be exact.
          The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the
          floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see
          the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.

                               ARAI
                    But... why? Why here? Why now?

                               WINTERS
                    Instinct, mostly. They're animals
                    at their core.
                        (looks off, distant)
                    And they recognize something
                    familiar in the air... in the
                    stars.

                        (BEAT)
                    What can I say? I'm a lover of
                    animals.
          The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some
          cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor. Filled
          by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad

                               W
          we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness.

                               INTERS
                    So you go and get to know each
                    other. And don't forget... play
                    nice.
          The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door.
          They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand.

                              KARAI
                    Not now. Our business will be
                    handled at a later time...

               After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet.
               Tired. Contemplative.

                                                                  UT TO:

               INT. TURTLES LAIR - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Three brothers sit around their breakfast table, looking hung
               over from the previous night's brawl. Mikey comes in, looking
               the worst of all, and plops into his seat. Cam circles table.

                         Dudes, did anyone get the license
                         plate of the thing that hit us last
                         night? Oi, my head...
               Don pours over a thick book on MONSTERS AND MYTHOLOGY.

                         Was it just me, or did that
                         creature look familiar?

                                   RAPHAEL
                         We coulda taken it if you slackers
                         woulda pitched in sooner.

                         place.

                         Well, I suppose that we shoulda let
                         Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread
                         happiness throughout the city... oh
                         wait... HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER
                         TRYIN' TA KILL US!!! Good call,

                         Come to think of it, it WAS pretty
                         strange to see the Foot too. And
                         who was that woman?

                         only one who has to be responsible!

                    Good morning, my sons.

                              TURTLES
                    Morning, sensei.
          Splinter makes himself a TEA. Room is SILENT.
          ON TURTLES - Raph and Leo GLARE at one another while they
          eat. Don is pouring over a THICK BOOK while Mikey sits with
          his forehead on the table.

                              SPLINTER
                    If anyone needs me, I'll be
                    watching my stories.

          S
           plinter walks out. OS sound of the TV being turned on. At
          the table, the glare continues.

                              NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)
                    And in the latest of a string of
                    strange criminal activity, a
                    construction site was nearly
                    destroyed last night. Authorities
                    believe a violent battle had taken
                    place earlier that evening.
          The boys react and rush into the MAIN LIVING AREA.
          ON TV - a well-coifed News Reporter stands outside of the I-
          BEAM TOWER. In the daylight, we can see the building is
          twisted and dented from the night's fighting.
          The boys immediately JUMP FORWARD. Mikey grabs the remote and
          ups the volume.

                              SPLINTER
                    My sons, what-
          Splinter's eyes go wide. He looks at his boys listening to
          the TV intently. Mikey nurses his sore head.

                         Leonardo, I am most disappointed in
                         you. You are the leader of your
                         brothers. I was counting on you to
                         bring order to the chaos of this
                         family.

                                   LEONARDO
                         But Master Splinter, how can I be
                         expected to do so when Ra-

                                   SPLINTER
                         There are no excuses when you are
                         the Leader, my student.
               ON LEO - Biting his tongue. Hard.

                                   SPLINTER
                         But the involvement of the Foot and
                         their mysterious leader worries me.

                         I'm personally worried about a
                         monster running around the streets
                         of New York. But hey, that's just
                         me.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael, there are better ways to
                         use your skills in ninjitsu. Fact-

               Various shots of Nightwatcher tearing all over the city. On

               throughout rafters above. The Foot try to help by blocking
               exits.
               - The Generals capture a werewolf-like creature in the high-

               April is dressed in work-out gear on a grouping of floor
               mats. She twirls a wooden KATANA as part of a floor routine.
               Wow - she's actually pretty good! Casey eats a bag of chips
               with one hand, does curls with a dumbbell with the other.

                                   CASEY

                         Suit yourself.

                         life. With me.
               Casey pauses a beat. Tries to be upbeat.

                                    CASEY
                         Yeah. Sure.
                              (beat - serious)
                         You?
               April thinks just as much.

                                   APRIL
                         Yeah.
               They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss.
               April doesn't notice. Awkward. Casey changes his mind.

                                   CASEY

               Casey slips out onto the fire escape. April knows better.

               Casey climbs up from the fire escape. Checks to make sure
               he's alone. He reaches inside a chimney flue and pulls out -
               A BASEBALL BAT and his CLASSIC WHITE HOCKEY MASK!
               He slips it on. Does a few warm up swings. Cricks his neck.

               All is still, until the panicked face of a BURGLAR enters
               frame. Being held by his collar.

                                   BURGLAR

                         IT AGAIN! I'M SORR-OOOF!
               BAM! - the leather fist of Nightwatcher slams Burglar back,
               tripping over an A/C duct. He tries to shield himself-
               REVERSE ANGLE - BOOM! - Nightwatcher lands in the FG.

                         yer HEAD!
               Night hurls him back into a roof access door, denting it.
               Raph's loving this. Walks to the Burglar and picks him up.

          It's getting serious. Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by
          Night's CHAIN, and pulled down. Raph's visor flips up.

               show him hanging upside-down. CAM WIDENS TO REVEAL he's bound

               sit perched on a high tower, surrounded by gargoyles. They
               blend right in. Both masks are off.

                         I dunno, I just got tired of the
                         "nothing". Sitting around waiting
                         for some disaster to cross our
                         paths. Of us battling Utroms and
                         Triceratons or any other friggin'
                         creature... when there was still
                         some guy gettin' mugged 100 feet
                         above the lair. Just didn't seem
                         right. `Specially if we had the
                         means to do somethin' about it.

                         And we did... but turns out I was
                         the only one who was willing to do
                         it, tho. So I just saved up, bought
                         and tweaked a sweet bike, fitted
                         the costume and began moonlighting.

               The two run and leap across the rooftops. Two vigilantes

          Creature. They subdue it with all their hardware. The Foot
          stand guard, helping in the BG.

          One of the generals effortlessly picks up a TRASH DUMPSTER
          and wallops the Creature with one blow.

                    On second thought...
          The Generals put the Creature in a cell. Wheel it to a
          TRANSPORTER VEHICLE as it drives away. They're just about to
          leave when-

               alone! Raph is 10 feet away as Casey flinches and takes off
               too.

               Raph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying

          Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato
          clamors along... keeping up with the weaving bike! In the
          fray, Casey looses his mask... as it gets trampled by Gato.
          It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey
          swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General.
          Suddenly - THUNK!
          A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks
          at it.

                    Um, Raph?
          Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid-
          ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back. Raph throws kicks
          and punches at their pursuer when he closes in.
          The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle
          upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails!
          ROOFTOP - They're trapped. He doesn't have a hope... aside
          from jumping the bike to the next roof!

          and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look
          back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure.

          Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato
          is in mid-air, taking off. Casey grabs the weakening Raph and
          drags him off.

               EXT. ROOFTOP BEHIND LARGE LETTER SIGN - CONTINUOUS

               Gato lands and patrols the roof... almost SNIFFING them out.
               Casey and Raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack.
               Suddenly - BOOM! - Gato finds them. He tries to smash through
               the steel door with his bare hands!
               Raph leans his body into the door as a last ditch effort.
               He's taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam
               by Gato. Casey tries to help as well.
               Gato comes close to breaking in. Very tense. Then-
               -the LIGHT on his exo-suit begins to STROBE. A signal. A
               signal to return home. He surveys quickly... then runs off.
               Casey and Raph fall out. Both shell-shocked.

               stuck in his shell, and has collapsed unconscious.

               April is finishing up with her workout. She hears the fire
               escape outside of the building and the window slide open.

                                   APRIL
                         Casey, I think we need to talk.

               OFF HER LOOK - Casey is standing there, bracing the near-
               unconscious Raph, now without his Nightwatcher garb.

                    South America. Long before the
                    Ashmecks and the Macaroons.

          shrieking. Blades clashing. April's retelling Winters' story.

                                                         DIP TO BLACK:
          Everyone is gathered around as April finishes. Mikey, in
          particular, is hunched over, intent. Casey, like before, has
          fallen asleep. Silence for a beat. Then-

                              DONATELLO
                    I'll work with April and see if
                    these Stars of Kikin she told us
                    about can give us any clues.

                              RAPHAEL
                    I say we just storm the castle and
                    face this jerk in person!

                    Raph, that would be the worst idea
                    yet. We hang back. Analyze.
                    Formulate a plan, THEN storm your
                    castle. Are we clear?
          Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway.
          Casey stops him. Quieter moment.

                    Raph. Don't do it, man.

                    Sometimes, just takin' a breather
                    is the best thing to do.
          ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is
          growing up. Raph knows he can't win.

               knuckle. Ready. Places a hand on the door... and opens it.
               ON DOORWAY - The creature is huddled over a pile of frozen
               meat. Chewing with pieces flying everywhere. Disgusting. It
               turns around - monkey-like and ferocious looking DEMON... but
               "cute" in a bizarre kinda way. Music builds as go-
               WIDER ON SIDE VIEW - Night stands there. The horrible demon
               creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too! Face off with
               Raph as we realize-
               -it's only THREE FEET TALL!

                                   NIGHTWATCHER
                         Hey there little fella. All that
                         commotion for just little ole y-
               The Demon SCREAMS! It jumps Night, slamming him to the floor
               behind a row of tables!

                                   NIGHTWATCHER (O.S.)

                         WAHH! OOOF! AAAGGH! OW!! WHOAAA!!!
               Plates, glasses and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all
               over the diner as the Demon pummels him.
               CLOSE ON NIGHT - The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming
               his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward,
               mouth open as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon
               jumps back and up, landing on a rotating CEILING FAN.

               T
                he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is
               ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped
               up on cocaine.
               A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night
               knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his
               pocket. And waits... until...
               ...the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs
               bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside!
               WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH! POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its
               mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and
               eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner!

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (victory taunting)
                    Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't
                    mess with the Nightwatcher!
          Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on
          the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds
          the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary.

                              DINER COOK
                    Pl-pl-please don't hurt me!

                               NIGHTWATCHER
                    Whattaya talkin' about? I JUST

                    SAVED YOU!

                              DINER COOK
                    Please, sir. I have kids.
          Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor.
          He picks it up, puts it on the counter.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                    There ya go, pal. Make sure this is
                    safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN' ME?

                              DINER COOK

                    TAKE IT! JUST TAKE IT! DON'T HURT

                    ME, PLEASE!

                              NIGHTWATCHER

                    LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN'

                    CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A

                    HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY?
                        (points threatening)

                    I JUST SAVED YOUR STINKIN' LIFE!
          Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash
          register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window.
          CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to
          the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders
          of LEO.
           ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of
          Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register.
          CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The
          frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him.

          B
           ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying
          to figure out his next move.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                    This night just keeps gettin'
                    better n' better...

               Tense stand-off as... Night suddenly bolts out the back as
               Leo bolts the roof in hot pursuit!

          

          

          78                                                                78

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

               Night tears down the streets and through back alleys. Leo
               keeps up with him effortlessly, hurling an assortment of
               THROWING STARS his way.
               Night suddenly DASHES OUT into traffic! Jumping over passing
               cars from roof to roof!

                                   LEONARDO
                         Nice try, amateur.
               Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his
               secrecy. Zip lines through power lines, avoids an oncoming
               bus, and flips back onto a cable.
                e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap!

                                   LEONARDO
                         Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't
                         you?
               They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top.
               Leo wastes no time in catching up.

          

          

          79                                                                79

               EXT. ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS

               The chase continues. Night giving it his all, and Leo keeping
               up pretty easily. He throws Leo a pretty strong curveball,
               and Leo barely recovers.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Okay, someone's been training
                         pretty hard.
               It begins to spit rain - and becomes a FRANK MILLER DOWNPOUR.

          

          

               EXT. ROOFTOP DEAD END - CONTINUOUS


          80                                                                80
               Night reaches an area that's a DEAD END. One side of the
               buildings has a LARGE LETTERED SIGN facing away. Fills the
               rooftop with silhouettes. No choice but to turn around...
               ...as Leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I want you to know that I
                         appreciate your intentions. But you
                         can't change the world like this.
               INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear
               Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him.

          

                                                                     70.

          

          

          

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (to himself in helmet)

                              L
                    Oh god. He's lecturing.

                               EONARDO
                        (now audible)
                    ...so I'm going to give you one
                    chance to just walk away and stop
                    this vigilante nonsense.
          Leo unsheathes his two katanas. Raph can't hear him.

                              NIGHTWATCHER
                        (to himself in helmet)
                    Okay, Leo. Wanna play?
          Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with
          expertise... then motions for Leo to fight. Charge at each
          other, running through the rain, weapons drawn.
          They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it
          out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline.
          There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks.
          Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn.

                              LEONARDO
                    What? How did you-
          ...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding.
          Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD.
          Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control,
          restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under
          Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante.

                              LEONARDO
                    Goodnight, dark prince.
          Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face
          falls... IT'S RAPHAEL! Leo pales.

                              LEONARDO
                    R-raph?

                        (THINKS)
                    What?
          But Raph doesn't feel like explaining. Refuses defeat.

                              RAPHAEL

                    AAAAAAAAGHH!!
          He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock.
          They yell at each other through the pouring rain.

          

                                                                          71.

          

          

          

                                   RAPHAEL
                         You're so friggin' smug! You think
                         the world revolves around YOU,
                         dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY
                         survive without the mighty and
                         powerful Leonardo to guide us
                         through our problems, HUH?!

                             (PACES)
                         Well, I gotta newsflash for ya - we
                         got along just fine without you.

                                   LEONARDO
                         I was training! Training to be a
                         better leader! For you! Why do you
                         hate me for that?!

                                   RAPHAEL
                         ...and whoever said I wanted to be
                         led? I shoulda gone on that
                         training!

                                   LEONARDO

                         Y
                          OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient
                         and hot-tempered! And more
                         importantly... I'm better than you.
               Raph stops in his tracks. Reaches behind his back... and
               pulls out his TWIN SAIS. He flips them to the front.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Well, big brother, I'd have to
                         disagree with you on that one.
               Raph takes a ready stance. Leo does too. And they fight.
               Brother vs. brother. Katana vs. Sai. Technique vs. Heart.

               In another part of the city, the Generals have caught the
               Demon from Pete's Diner. As they carry him to the caravan,
               their RADIO COMM goes off.

               Camera RISES UP until we reach the rooftop where Leo and Raph
               continue to duke it out in the rain.
               They battle. In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball
               of anger, unleashing everything on Leo.

               It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground... holding a sai

               MILLIMETERS FROM HIS EYEBALL!
               Tense. Raph shakes. He looks like he's going to do it... then
               stops. He collapses back. Almost ashamed of what he's done.
               Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him. They pant
               heavily. The rain dies down.
               Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother.
               He suddenly STOPS and looks back at Leo, small in the
               distance.
               CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over him. He looks up
               to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to fight
               back... but is too wiped from Raph.
               GATO POV - "reading" Leo on the ground. He frowns.

                                   GENERAL GATO
                         It is neither monster nor human.
               CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile.

                         Then he shall perfectly serve our
                         purposes... let us inform our
                         commander that the final creature
                         has been captured.
               ON RAPH - He sees the commotion from afar... as Leo gets
               TRANQUILIZED with the Generals' dart cannon.

                                   RAPHAEL

                         LEO!!!
               Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and
               drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and
               catch his brother.

               Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The
               sun begins to rise. He has to return to the sewer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               April and Don are poring over books at the kitchen. Mikey
               paces behind them. Raph storms in, barrels past them all.

               INT. TURTLES LAIR - TRAINING DOJO

               Raphael walks to Splinter, practicing himself in the dojo.
               Raph holds his Sais in one hand, his bolo chain in the other.
               Clenches both tight.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael? What is the matter?

                                   RAPHAEL

                             (RANTING)
                         I was out, and did... something...
                         something happened and I- ARRRGH!!!
               Raphael picks up a HEAVY WEIGHT and hurls is across the dojo.
               Splinter is unfazed, but he won't take any more.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael! Kneel.
               Raph stops. Breathing heavy. Falls in line - walking to
               Splinter and dropping to his knees in front of his father.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         I did something... I did something
                         really stupid, Master Splinter.

                                    SPLINTER
                         Go on...

                                   RAPHAEL

                             (SEMI-RAMBLING)
                         I know why you chose him now. I
                         know that there's a reason why he's
                         the better son and I'm not.

                             (THINKS)
                         And I think I made things worse
                         tonight.
                             (beat - calming down)
                         A WHOLE lot worse... I know you
                         must be ashamed of me, father.
               Raphael is lost in his guilt. Splinter kneels in front of
               Raph.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Raphael. You always bear the
                         world's problems on your shoulders.
                         It is an admirable quality when you
                         are a protector of others...
                plinter gently lays a hand on Raph's shoulder.

          

                                                                       74.

          

          

          

                                   SPLINTER
                         But you must realize that while, at
                         times, you may not be my favorite
                         student, it does not mean that you
                         are my least favorite son.
               Raphael looks up. Having not thought of it that way.

                                   SPLINTER
                         You are strong, passionate and
                         loyal to a fault. These are the
                         merits of a great leader as well...
                         but only when tempered with
                         compassion and humility.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         But Master Splinter, I messed up
                         big tonight... I mean BIG.
               Splinter chews on this.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Leonardo? R

                                (beat, ashamed)
                         Yes.
               Splinter is grim. Nods. But he moves on.

                                   SPLINTER
                         Well then, I believe your brothers
                         may be in need of a leader.
               Raphael looks up. Finally, his shot. He holds his SAIS in one
               hand, and his BOLO CHAIN in the other. Ninja Turtle vs.
               Nightwatcher. He grips them both hard. He drops the chain.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         Thank you... father.

                    So, the first time that this portal
                    was opened, the Stars of Kikin
                    aligned...
                        (sketches on high tech

                         SCREEN)
                    ...and that's why it occurred in
                    that specific South American
                    region.
                        (more doodles)
                    Now if we take into account the
                    continual rotation of the Earth
                    since then, as well as the gradual
                    celestial shift that's happened and
                    been recorded over... well, over
                    the course of that mountain of
                    books over there... we now know our
                    new location.
          Donnie's drawn a NEW LINE from the alignment of the stars.
          April elbows Casey to wake him up.

               The lobby has changed. Shots establishing the jury-rigged
               nature of Winters Tower.
               - The large Aztec-like calendar on the lobby floor suddenly
               SPLITS and slides open, creating a 100 foot circle in the
               middle. Underneath is the TOWERS CELL BASEMENT.

               -
                 The   disk in the basement is suddenly RAISED up to the lobby
               area,   replacing the slick marble design with an antiquated
               stone   version. Only now, THIRTEEN CREATURE CELLS surround the
               disk.   Very ceremonial.
               - Finally, Winters' office elevator LOWERS from high above.
               He's in the actual ceremonial gear worn by Yaotl years ago.
               He holds the helmet to his side. Very serious. He looks over
               his now-ceremonial lobby... satisfied.

               Quick shots of April and Casey gearing up. Casey with his off-
               the-shelf sporting gear. April with sleek-looking Japanese
               combat gear and weaponry.
               They both emerge from their rooms, dressed to kill. Casey's
               jaw drops as we scope out April.

                         April, this is going to be
                         dangerous. You sure you're in?

                                   APRIL
                         I feel responsible, fellas. I found
                         the Generals for him.

               Van takes off as the CAMERA SLOWS in the street, watching it

               Winters stands with Four Generals in his office, overseeing
               the portal. Ready.

          

          

               INT. WINTERS GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER


          91                                                                91
               Karai walks down the center path of the garden, flanked by a
               DOZEN FOOT NINJA. She motions for them to take position.

                                   KARAI
                         As ordered - no one gets in. No one
                         interferes. No one bears witness.
               SUDDENLY - the security alarm from the front gate BUZZES.
               Karai waits a beat. It buzzes again. She walks to the
               SECURITY PANEL by the front gate.
                N MONITOR - We see CASEY standing there, obscured by a LARGE
               WOODEN CRATE IN FRONT OF HIM. Karai coldly opens the gate.

                              KARAI
                    May I help you?

                              CASEY
                    Yeah, hey, I was supposed   to drop
                    this off for Mr. Winters.   If I
                    don't get this done, I am   majorly
                    in the doghouse. You know   what I'm
                    sayin', right? Right?
          The two stare at each other as the CAM ANGLES BEHIND KARAI -
          she's holding a KATANA SWORD behind her back!
           AM DOLLIES OVERHEAD as we see that Casey is packing MAJOR
          sports gear "heat" on his end too. Both don't let on.

                              KARAI
                    Please come in, then.

                              CASEY
                    Really!?
                        (beat - gets composed)
                    I mean, "but of course".
          Casey wheels the crate inside. The gate closes only KARAI HAS
          NOW DISAPPEARED! Casey opens the front hatch, revealing Don,
          Raph, Mikey, April and Splinter.

                    And who did that?!

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    What?! Why does everyone always
                    call ME out?
          A long beat. Then...

                              SPLINTER
                    I apologize my sons.
          Everyone looks at sheepish Splinter. A beat. Suddenly-
          WIDER - The empty garden begins to move. CREEPY, as DOZENS OF
          FOOT NINJA begin to rise out of the shadows and slink toward
          our heroes, surrounding them.
          KARAI makes a dramatic entrance, landing in front of April
          and Casey. Tense beat.

                              CASEY
                    I suppose this is where we all take
                    out our sharp and pointy things?

                              KARAI
                    You suppose correctly.

               INT. WINTERS TOWER

               Winters walks along all the cells - a final check. He
               examines one of the cells.
               PUSH IN - it's LEO. He's slowly waking up - groggy. Muttering
               incoherently. He PASSES OUT AGAIN.

          

          

          93                                                             93

               EXT. WINTERS PARK

               We finally get to see how much of an ass-kicker Master
               Splinter is. Same with April, who squares off against Karai.
               They fight hard. April ends up cornered, about to be skewered
               by her blade when...
               -CLUNK! She wobbles and then passes out. When Karai falls out
               of frame, she reveals CASEY JONES a hundred yards behind her
               holding his HOCKEY STICK! April frowns.

                                   APRIL
                         I had the situation under control.

                                   CASEY

                             (SMIRKS)
                         You're welcome.
               Mikey fights the most like Jackie Chan - comical maneuvers
               backed by solid-hitting blows. Don uses his bo-staff in 1001
               different ways, both offensively and defensively.
               Casey is enjoying the hell out of it. High flying, adrenaline
               rush. He even catches April checking him out, and vice versa.
               April suddenly spots an opening to the front doors!

                                   APRIL
                         Guys! Front door is open. Now!
               They all charge the front door!

               Winters is happy. He looks up to the heavens. Checks a time
               piece. Winters begins chanting ANCIENT MAGICK/SPELLS. Looks
               up through the opening in the middle of the building.

               The cam PULLS UP through the building. Up over NYC. Through
               the clouds... and into space until we pass all ALIGNED STARS.

               S
                PACE - The final star drifts into position. A LIGHT BURST
               EFFECT travels down each star, headed to Earth.
               BACK IN LOBBY - The light burst flies into the lobby and hits
               the circle in the middle of all the monsters' cells.
               ON CIRCLE - The pieces suddenly start to move around. Almost
               like a sliding puzzle. Then they start to randomly SINK
               further into the ground. Light pours out of them, until all
               of them give way to create THE PORTAL.
               POV OFFICE ABOVE - Each of the Thirteen Cells LIGHT UP to
               acknowledge their contents. 1... 2... 3...

                                   WINTERS
                         Finally... finally!
               ON GENERALS - they're still. Emotionless.
               The light sequence gets to Leo's cell... it doesn't light up.

                                    WINTERS
                         What?
               His mind reels. Looks down at the cells. Nothing. Then it
               hits him like a ton of bricks. He turns to the Generals...

                                   WINTERS
                         What did you do?!

               INT. WINTERS LOBBY

               Our six Heroes all tear into the lobby. They turn back, an
               army of ninjas closing in on them!

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         I'm working on it.
               Raph grips his sais with renewed strength. Casey looks
               around, putting things together mentally. Tension builds!

                                   RAPHAEL
                         We get ready for round two.
               ON CASEY IN CORNER - He reaches into his back, takes out a
               hockey stick and - SMASH!!! - kills a LOBBY VASE. Suddenly,
               sirens blare as the OUTSIDE BUILDING SECURITY SHUTTERS SLAM
               DOWN just like in Act I!
               The Ninjas are locked out!

          Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles.

                    Nice work, Jones.

                    Look!
          OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the
          vast lobby. The cells are glowing. The portal worsens.

                               DONATELLO
                    And that would be the swirling
                    vortex to another world, I assume.

                        (BEAT)
                    Cool.
          They all run over. Mikey runs to a cell.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Leo! Is that you?
          RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    I guess that would be a "no".
          ON RAPH - He finds Leo!

                    Out of the way, please.

          out. LIFELESS.

                    Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo,
                    please wake up!
          Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is
          DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as...

                              LEONARDO (O.S.)
                    Wh-wh-what took you s-so long?
          WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength
          back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only
          imagine what Raph's been through to rescue him. A beat.

                              RAPHAEL

               SMASH!!!!
               ANGLE UP - As WINTERS is thrown out the window of his
               elevator office! He heads straight for a sword wielding
               BRONZE STATUE... particularly the sword part. Closer...
               closer... and...
                ..just misses it. WHUMP! He crashes onto the floor.

               MOTIONLESS.

               nearly 150 feet above them.

               INT. WINTERS LOBBY

               Winters' body still lays on the floor. This is bad.

                                   CASEY
                         Is he... is he dead?
               Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes
               Winters' limp body. Nothing.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Yup. He's WAY dead, dude.
               WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room.
               ON EVERYONE - Their faces all drop as Winters stands up in
               his mini-crater, brushes himself off and is perfectly fine!
               Winters' mind is racing a mile a minute. Doesn't even notice
               those around him.

                                   WINTERS

                             (GROANS)
               Raph can't take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts
               them at Winters. THAT gets his attention. Winters looks up in
               awe at seeing the mutated freaks in front of him.

                         Mister Winters. We mean you no
                         harm.

                                   RAPHAEL
                         No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to
                         give you piercin's in places you
                         never imagined if you don't tell us
                         what's going on.

               Winters collapses on the floor. Head in hands.

                                   WINTERS
                         This was our chance. We could have
                         changed it all.

                         We know everything Max. We know
                         you're trying to recreate what
                         Yaotl started 3000 years ago.

               The same red-tinted battlefield we left in Winter's
               flashback. Monsters are leaping through the hoards.

                                    INTERS (V.O.)
                         There are things, Miss O'Neil, no
                         one could possibly know...
               Camera pushes in on YAOTL and his Four Generals high on a
               hill, surveying the action.
               ON YAOTL - He takes off his helmet... IT'S WINTERS HIMSELF.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         It was I who stood on that
                         battlefield all those years ago.
               Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction. He
               looks shocked, surprised.
               A SHADOW falls over Winters body. He looks up - it's a
               ceremonial SHAMAN from their enemies' camp.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         And we had to pay a price.
               The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting. Winters is pulled
               up in the air, and in a crackle of red electricity, we see
               him become... grayer.
                N GENERALS - Same electricity. Different effect. They
               scream, slowly turned into STONE. Cracks form on their
               bodies, light shooting out of it.

                                   WINTERS (V.O.)
                         We were cursed that day. My four
                         comrades-in-arms were turned into
                         stone.

                    immobile... yet fully aware at all
                    times to ponder the crimes we've
                    committed.
          ON WINTERS - He stands on the battlefield. Alone. As he
          walks, the CAM MOVES around him. During this, we X-DISSOLVE
          BETWEEN A FEW SELECT TIME PERIODS between then and now.

                              WINTERS (V.O.)
                    My curse was to live... forever. To
                    feel the pain of losing love time
                    and time again. Of boredom. The
                    pain... of time.
           ACK IN PRESENT DAY. Winters stops walking...

                              WINTERS
                    We were doomed to live this way
                    until, as the Shaman put it, "you
                    corrected the mistakes of your
                    past".
                        (gestures to the lobby)
                    That's what this is about. Penance,
                    Miss O'Neil. Finally getting a
                    chance to right our wrongs.

                              GENERAL AGUILA (O.S.)
                    Our master fails to include crucial
                    points in his tale.

                    He fails to discuss the petrified
                    agony of three thousand years.

                              GENERAL SERPIENTE
                    Of the torture of taking CENTURIES

                               GENERAL AGUILA
                    So, while our great leader basked
                    in the warmth of the sun and the
                    glory of fresh air... we rotted in
                    the stone hell that lasted

          sinking into the floor.

                    But thanks to his cunning, his
                    technology, we are now capable of
                    LIVING... we have now become-
                        (close, creepy)
                    - gods.

                              GENERAL SERPIENTE
                    And we shall finish what we began
                    all those years ago. We will
                    finally have our victory.

                    Even with one monster still free,

          Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the
          very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and
          her Foot Clan. She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS -
          military/ninja style.

               WIDER - 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building,
               leaving Karai and 4 Foot Ninja behind.

                         My soldiers will find the
                         thirteenth monster. And you will

                         don't have much time.
               Karai runs off. April looks over at Winters. He nods, still
               hurting. April takes off after Karai, leaving Casey behind
               with the Four Foot. They run out into the garden, just in
               time to see the other Foot disappear into the night.

               They all leap in the way, standing between Winters and his
               backstabbing Generals.
               Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him,
               defiant. Then Mikey. Then Don.

                         So... anybody from out of town?

               W

                E BEGIN TO INTERCUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LOBBY FIGHT,

               AND CASEY/APRIL MONSTER CHASE...
               LOBBY - The combatants all pair off for their final battle.
               Utter commotion. Mikey is paired with Serpiente.
               Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He uses his quick
               speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding Statue.
               Leo fights with Gato. He can't dodge him. He's too fast. Leo
               lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils - BOOM! Leo's knocked
               shell-first into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with
               swords and bladed weapons of all kinds.

                                   LEONARDO
                         Come to daddy.
               MOMENTS LATER - SMASH! - Leo steps out, ready for action.
               Strapped with a dozen swords tucked all over his body. He
               pulls them out randomly as needed throughout the fight.

          Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS.
          It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be
          aware of their environment to avoid defeat.

                              RAPHAEL
                    Sensei! How you guys doing?!
          ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in.
          About five more to go. Splinter also flips around and takes
          out another demon trying to escape. Splinter actually seems
          to be having FUN.

                              SPLINTER
                    Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL!
          BACK WITH APRIL AND CASEY - Rush the streets of NYC.

                              KARAI
                    My troops have located the final
                    monster. At the harbor docks.

                               ASEY
                    Oh, I got this one covered.
          Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD
          THROUGH THE STREETS until it reaches the pier. CAM CRANES
          over the harbor warehouses until we see -
          - the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE.
          It appears unconscious - a hundred or so TRANQ DARTS sticking
          out of it's back. The Van pulls onto the scene.

          I
           NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at
          each other.

                               ASEY
                    Huh. Now there's somethin' you
                    don't see every day...
          They pile out of the van.

                              CASEY
                        (off of monster)
                    Well, I guess we have to figure out
                    how to get handsome here back to
                    Winters' Tower.

                              KARAI
                    We should tie it to the van and
                    drag it back.

                              CASEY
                    Wow. You're... hard core.
          ON CREATURE - A Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body.
          As he turns his head he doesn't see THE CREATURE'S EYE OPEN!

          

                                                                  90.

          

          

          
          WIDER - The creature stands up as everyone turns to see. The
          creature DOG SHAKES his hide, sending the tranq darts flying
          everywhere! They slam into the walls like shrapnel.
          ON FOOT - As they dive out of the way. One gets hit with a
          dart in the chest. Looks down. Passes out.

                                CASEY
                    Incoming!
          ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA
          THUNK THUNK - darts stick in the door!
          ON CREATURE - He's now standing... and dying to chase
          something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van!
          Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling
          back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the
          creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end
          and spin the vehicle around.

                              APRIL

                    FAST! GO FAST NOW!!!
          Casey guns it, the 12-foot creature mere inches away!
          STARS IN SKY - Karai sees the stars are slowly moving out of
          alignment. Losing time fast.
          BACK IN LOBBY - CRANE DOWN on Winters and Splinter. On the
          last full cell.
          ON PORTAL - A pair of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out.
          In the BG, dozens of winged DEMONS fly around inside.

                              LEONARDO
                    They better hurry with that last
                    monster!

                              RAPHAEL
                    I'm sure my man Casey's got it all
                    under control...

                              LEONARDO
                    That's what I'm afraid of.
          BACK WITH VAN - CLOSE ON CASEY'S FACE - As he's screaming his
          guts out.

                              CASEY

                    I GOTTA TELL YA... I'M, UH, I'M

                    STILL NOT SURE THAT THIS WAS THE

                    BEST IDEA!!!!
          WIDER - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as LIVE
          BAIT to attract the creature! It's working too! The creature
          pounces along like an awkward greyhound run. April drives.

          

                              R

          

          

          

          

                                                                     91.

          

          

          
          Casey is throwing SPORTS EQUIPMENT at it from his large
          hockey bag. The creature is catching and eating it all.
          INSIDE VAN - Casey slips in.

                              APRIL
                    What are you doing in here?!

                              CASEY
                    Ran outta food.
          They all look out the back window as the creature pounds
          closer and closer...
          BACK IN LOBBY - The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill.
          Turtles all get thrown into a pile between the Generals.

                               APHAEL
                    Listen. I'm the last guy to sound
                    like a TV cartoon, but I think we
                    need to work together.

                              MICHAELANGELO
                    Teamwork. The more you know...
          Don clocks Mikey behind the head.

                              LEONARDO

                        (TEASING)
                    Why Raph, no solo act tonight?
          Raph grins. They stand, backs to back... finally as a TEAM.
          They trust one another, and their efficiency shows.
          ON PORTAL - More tentacles begin to come out. More claws
          surround the surface edges.
          ON TMNT - The music swells. The brothers act and think as
          one. The way they should. They way they will from now on.
          ON SPLINTER - As cam PUSHES IN, he stands up. Seeing his
          sons. As one. As BROTHERS. He smiles.

                              SPLINTER
                    Yes. Yes, my sons.
          The Generals can't keep up. It's enough to distract them to
          make mistakes the TMNT take advantage of.
          ON WINTERS - Sees the portal light beginning to SHRINK!
          Because of the TMNT's moves, the Generals are now on the
          precipice of the Portal, being pulled back. They struggle to
          stand.
          The brothers look at each other. The place is violent with a
          whirlwind and screaming Monsters.

                                RAPHAEL
                      So who wants ta call it a day?

                                  LEONARDO
                      I'm in.

                                DONATELLO
                      Affirmative.

                                MICHAELANGELO
                      Roger dodger, dude.
          The   TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch
          and   take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into
          the   PORTAL! They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils
          and   pulled back!
          The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal.
          Silent. Splinter runs over to them.

                                SPLINTER
                      My sons, I am so proud of you all.
          Then - BOOM! - the Generals' ARMS slam onto the ridge of the
          portal - BEGINNING TO CLIMB OUT! The Turtles jump back.

                                TURTLES

                      WAAAHHHHH/OHMIGOD!/WHOOAAA!!!

                                GENERAL AGUILA
                      Silly children. We are immortals
                      made of stone! The Earth has only
                      BEGUN to feel our wrath!
          The brothers are screwed. They can't stop the Generals. Until-
          BEHIND TURTLES - Glowing headlights grow larger. Closer. As -
          KERSMASH!!! The Van flies through the lobby, musical chime
          and all, being trailed by the Creature! April clips a corner
          as the vehicle spins out of the path.
           he Creature tries to stop, but can't on the marble floor. It
          falls, sliding, clicking its claws trying to stop!

                                  WINTERS

                      LOOK OUT!
          Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the
          Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the
          Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back
          into the Portal!
          ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle.
          ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get
          out, only now, we see they are HUMAN... their curse broken...
          and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them.

          

                                                                  93.

          

          

          
          Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal.

                              GENERAL AGUILA

                    YOU CANNOT DEFEAT US! WE-
          WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion!

                              RAPHAEL
                    I thought he'd never shut up.
          WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    HOLY CRAP!!!

                                 RAPHAEL

                    WE DID IT!

                              TURTLES

                    YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT!
          The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud.
          ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door clangs open. Casey piles
          out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on Casey in a
          very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out
          last beside them.

                              CASEY
                        (caught - looks at both)
                    Oh. I, uh -
          HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks.

                              APRIL
                    Don't try to tell me for one second
                    that you didn't enjoy tha-
          Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like
          they should have been kissing all along.
          They stop. Noses close. Smile. They pull apart, revealing
          MIKEY standing there. Watching them all gooey-eyed.

                              MICHAELANGELO

                    AWWWWWW....
          Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers
          again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment.
          Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and
          the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps
          forward -

                              KARAI
                    You are every bit the warriors I
                    was informed you were. You have
                    passed.

          

                                                                  94.

          

          

          
          ON TMNT - they're confused.

                              LEONARDO
                    Passed what?

                              RAPHAEL
                    You know us?

                              KARAI
                    I've known OF you for some time.
                        (beat, to Leo's question)
                    Savor your victory tonight. For
                    soon we will have further business
                    together.

                              SPLINTER
                    What kind of business?

                              KARAI
                    The kind that involves familiar
                    faces from your past...
          ON TURTLES - They all look at each other.

                              RAPHAEL
                    She doesn't mean...
          They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED.
          Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner.
          Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly.

                               RAPHAEL
                    Winters?
          ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned.
          Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is
          spotted red with his M
                               own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek.

                               ICHAELANGELO
                    I'm never usually that happy to be
                    bleeding.

                              DONATELLO
                    You would be if you were an
                    immortal who couldn't bleed for
                    three thousand years...
          Winters looks at all the Turtles.

                              WINTERS
                    Thank you. Thank you from the
                    bottom of my heart. You've made a
                    very old man, very very happy.

                CAM PULLS BACK, out of the building, onto the street. See the
                destruction. The clearing skies. THE SUNRISE.

                Raph comes to Splinter's room.

                                     APHAEL
                          You wanted to see me Sensei?

                          Sit down, Raphael.

                                    RAPHAEL
                          Thank you, Master Splinter, for
                          your guidance.
                              (thinks, humble)
                          I can only hope that one day, I
                          will be able to begin the next
                          stage of my training like Leo.
                Splinter smiles. Reaches into a box and takes out a similar
                MEDALLION to the one given to Leonardo.

                                     SPLINTER
                          That, my son, you already have.

                          all our questions... is family.
                Raph beams as he accepts the "badge". He excitedly stands up.
                Splinter looks to the hallway where his eyes meet Leo's. They
                exchange knowing smiles as Splinter winks and we-

                APRIL'S POV INSIDE HELMET - We see a small DIAMOND RING taped
                to the visor. She takes it off. Beaming. Models it on her
                hand. She leans forward.

                          So what makes a family? Personally,
                          it's more than sharing a roof or a
                          bathroom. It's sharing life... My
                          father taught me that, and I think
                          it's pretty much true... y'know,
                          provided that you don't kill each
                          other in the process. Or that no
                          one touches your stuff. Or makes
                          loud noises when you're trying to
                          sleep. Or...

                They run close to the camera, once again, a family.

                                    RAPHAEL (V.O.)
                          Hey, nobody said it was easy.

                And as RAPHAEL and LEONARDO leap toward camera, we-

      --------------------------------------------------------------

      FADE IN ON:

      EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN

      Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN

      We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known
      World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.

      In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.

      Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
      over a cliff:

      AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.

      Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
      the ice. A human figure. This is:

      JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.

      Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
      an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
      backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
      JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -

      CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
      below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He
      looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:

                              BOND
                 There has to be an easier way to earn
                 a living.

      Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -

      ANOTHER ANGLE -

      He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a
      toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -

      THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -

      BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -

      And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of
      water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached
      to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.

      Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and
      forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.

      At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other
      pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:

      THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

      Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on
      the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.

      ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

      Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally
      frayed through.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls
      himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE
      ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,
      he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely
      holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.

      EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -

      Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -
      through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.

      As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he
      smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -

      THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -

      Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.

      IN THE WATERBED -

      A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,
      he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.

      NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)

      Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:

      BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -

      On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled
      down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.
      In other words: This was the only way in.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK
      CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the
      side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.

      He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond
      slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.

      EXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES -

      EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -

      Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,
      amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.

      EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -

      Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the
      bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:

      A ROCK OUTCROPPING.

      Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He
      unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a
      HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:

      A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)

      50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen
      MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the
      ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying
      HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.

      Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with
      INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.

      BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.

      THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -

      He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining
      over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.

      THE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON.

                              BOND'S VOICE
                       (over a speaker)
                 Seven, in position.

                              TANNER'S VOICE
                 Roger, Seven.

      Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS,
      including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK,
      an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6.

      M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him:

                              M
                 ... What were you saying, Admiral?
                 Something about this 'not being a job
                 for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing
                 playboy spy?'

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 - I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's
                 'assistance' in my report to the
                 Prime Minister. But this is, still,
                 a naval operation.

                              M
                 What do they say in Russia, General
                 Bukharin?
                       (asks questions in
                        flawless Russian)

      The general chuckles. Translates:

                              GENERAL BUKHARIN
                 'In a joint operation, someone's nose
                 always gets put out of joint.'

      M turns to Admiral Roebuck:

                              M
                 I'm interested in success, Admiral.
                 Not who gets credit.
                       (turning to:)
                 Mr. Tanner: What have we got?

      Tanner points to the video wall with a RED LASER PEN.

                              TANNER
                       (ironically)
                 A regular terrorist swap meet. Death
                 at discount: Two Chinese Long March

                       (interrupting)
                 Stolen -

                              TANNER
                 And the crates look like American M-16
                 assault rifles, Chilean antipersonnel
                 mines, six French Exocet missiles, and
                 75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of
                 Czech made C-4 Semtech explosive.
                       (beat)
                 Something for everyone. Fun for the
                 whole family.

                              M
                       (freezing him with a glance)
                 What about ID's?

                              TANNER
                       (pushes a button on a console)
                 One to seven: Deal the face cards.

      THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond adjusts a knob on the scope.

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

      On the video-screen, the picture zooms to a CLOSE UP of one of the
      arms traders. Tanner presses a button, and - almost instantly - the
      man's bio and vitals appear on another video screen.

                              TANNER
                 Gustav Meinholtz. Neo-Nazi, former
                 East German STASI agent. Ties to the
                 Beider-Meinhoff gang.
                       (pressing a button)
                 Aces high, seven. Bid to the east.

      Bond shifts his aim, east. (Intercut as necessary) He zeroes in on
      another face, and the man's stats appear in London.

                              TANNER
                 Vilko Barkoviac. Bosnian war
                 criminal; thought to be operating
                 freelance out of Teheran.
                       (pressing a button)
                 Full house, seven. Bid to the North.

      Bond complies. Another face, another set of stats:

                              TANNER
                 Sitoshi Isagura. Japanese religious
                 fanatic. Wanted for the Tokyo subway -

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                       (impatiently, cutting him off:)
                 I've seen enough. Let's finish this.
                       (ordering M:)
                 Tell your man to drop back. We're
                 initiating plan B -

                              M
                 But -

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 - Thank you, M. But this is more
                 than your man can handle.
                       (to Bukharin)
                 Are we in agreement?

                              BUKHARIN
                       (hesitant, at first)
                 - Yes. Yes.

                              M
                 Admiral -

      Moving swiftly, the Admiral has picked up a RED PHONE:

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 Command to Nelson: Authorization to
                 fire.

      EXT. A BRITISH WARSHIP - STEAMING IN THE GULF OF OMAN -

                 Weapons authorized. Prepare to fire.
                 On my count: Five. Four. Three. Two -

      EXT. DECK OF THE WARSHIP -

      A launcher rotates, and - BOOM - a Cruise missile blasts off.

      INT. WARSHIP WEAPONS CONTROL ROOM -

                              FIRING OFFICER
                 Cruise missile away -

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

                              FIRING OFFICER'S VOICE (Cont'd)
                 Time to target: Four minutes.

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 I appreciate your assistance, M. But
                 this is now a military operation.

                              M
                       (urgently, to Tanner)
                 Bring up the tracking satellite. And
                 get 007 out of there.

      Tanner hits a button - and a third video screen appears, displaying a
      satellite view of the area, detailing the Cruise's path and progress.

                              TANNER
                 One to seven: Exit target area.
                 Repeat -

                              BOND'S VOICE
                 Seven to one. Negative. Wait.

      THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond has taken his eye from the scope. He's peering at:

      THE MIG-29'S - ("MiG-1," AND "MiG-2") -

      A FORKLIFT appears from behind the TRUCK blocking the view of "MiG-l"
      A TALL BALD MAN is riding the empty fork, with his back to us.

      BOND -

      Puts his eye back on the scope, shifts the rifle -

      MI-6/VIDEO WALL -

      Bond's scope view settles on THE BALD MAN. The forklift reaches the
      back of the truck. HE STEPS OFF as the fork begins rising to unload
      something. And as the man turns, FACING US to scan the area:

                              TANNER
                 Oh, no.

                              M
                 Who is it?

                              TANNER
                       (calling up his stats)
                 Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear
                 specialist.

                              M
                 Meaning there may be nuclear material
                 down there?

      Tanner nods. A look passes from M, to Bukharin, to Roebuck.

      THE CRUISE MISSILE -

      Hugging the surface, crossing from water to land.

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

                              VOICE FROM WARSHIP
                 Time to target: Three minutes.
                       (sfx: Beep!)
                 Target acquired. Weapon armed.

      Tension. Adrenaline. QUIET PANIC. On the SCREEN, the FORK LIFT has
      pulled a RED BOX from the truck, a SHORT ROUND MAN appearing with it.

                              M
                 Who is that?!? What's in the box??

                              TANNER
                       (punching buttons)
                 I don't know. He's not in the database -

                              M
                       (to Bukharin)
                 What's in the box, General?
                       (he shrugs)
                 What's in the box???

      BUKHARIN
      (sheepishly)
      ... We usually... Transport...
      Weapons grade uranium.

      Shock sweeps the room. M turns on Tanner:

                              M
                 Will it go off?

                              TANNER
                 Maybe. Maybe not.

                              M
                 Abort the cruise.

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 It's too late -

                              M
                 GET BOND OUT OF THERE.

                              TANNER
                 One to seven - one to seven -

      BOND - SQUINTING THROUGH THE RIFLE AT THE OUTCROPPING -

                              BOND
                 Negative, one. NOT YET.

      THE TRUCK/MiG-l, ON THE GROUND/THROUGH THE SCOPE -

      THE BALD MAN slaps the back of the truck obscuring MiG-1. THE TRUCK
      PULLS AWAY, revealing MiG-l's WING. Hanging from the weapons pod: A
      NUCLEAR BOMB.

      BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Mutters a curse.

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

                              TANNER
                 Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield,
                 one kiloton.

                              M
                 Will the cruise set it off?

                              TANNER
                 Yes.

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                       (to Bukharin)
                 Jesus. Can't you people keep
                 anything locked up?

                              GENERAL BUKHARIN
                 We didn't know it was missing.

                              M
                 Get me the Prime Minister. Alert
                 NATO, the CIA, the Pentagon.
                       (presses a button:)
                 Seven: This is a direct order. I
                 want you out of there. Do you copy?

      THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond's headset lies on top of the rock, along with the telescopic
      sight - still broadcasting.

      Find Bond, crouching BEHIND the rock. Automatic rifle in one hand,
      GRENADE in the other. He pulls the pin, hurls it 40 feet away.
      Pauses. Waits, counting down time. Then -

      BOND SPRINGS. SHOOTS at one of the CRATES. IT BLOWS UP, just as -
      THE GRENADE EXPLODES.

      There's PANIC ON THE GROUND. Men running everywhere as THE RADAR/
      GATLING GUN spins, and SENDS A HAIL OF FIRE at Bond's diversion.

      And with this, BOND is off, SPRINTING INTO THE CHAOS.

      THE SAME SCENE - VIDEO SCREEN - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM.

      Stoned silence. Disbelief. Tanner whispers:

                              TANNER
                 God help him.

      THE CRUISE MISSILE - FLYING THROUGH A MOUNTAIN RAVINE -

      God help the rest of us.

      THE SECRET AIR BASE -

      As various factions shoot at each other (Who's the traitor?) Bond
      streaks toward the action. Without breaking stride, he swings his
      gun to the right: TWO BURSTS. THREE MEN DIE. Still running, he
      swings to the left: ANOTHER BURST. TWO MORE DOWN.

      Ahead, Bond sees the FLIGHT CREWS DASHING for the MiG's. He makes a
      beeline for MiG-1.

      ANGLE ON THE BALD MAN -

      Slamming the gate on the RED BOX in a cargo truck. Rushing to the
      passenger door. Climbing in. The SHORT ROUND MAN floors the
      accelerator, driving them away.

      THE CRUISE MISSILE - STARTING ITS DESCENT DOWN A MOUNTAIN

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - M, WATCHING HELPLESSLY -

                              VOICE FROM WARSHIP
                 Time to target: Thirty seconds.

      WIDE ON MiG-1 -

      The pilot climbs the ladder to the cockpit. Running at full tilt,
      BOND LEAPS, pulls the man down. They fall to the tarmac, FIGHTING.
      Bond SHOVES A KNIFE in the man's ribs, killing him.

      Kneeling, Bond takes the pilot's helmet off. He looks up: A MAN is
      coming at him with a GUN. In one unbroken move, Bond YANKS THE KNIFE
      from the pilot's body and THROWS IT - thwack - into the man's heart.

      ANGLE ON MIG-2'S PILOT - WATCHING THIS FROM HIS COCKPIT.

      RETURN ON BOND - CLIMBING INTO THE COCKPIT -

      Where the COPILOT (having climbed in from the other side,) sees it's
      not the right guy. As he fumbles for a weapon, BOND BASHES HIM WITH
      THE HELMET. The copilot collapses into his seat, unconscious.

      Bond settles into his seat, fires the engines, closes the double
      canopy, and begins taxiing out.

      THE CRUISE MISSILE - CROSSING OVER THE PERIMETER OF THE AIR BASE

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - ROEBUCK, TANNER, M, WATCHING, UNABLE TO BREATHE -

      HIGH ANGLE - THE RUNWAY -

      The CRUISE SKIMS IN DIRECTLY OVER BOND'S PLANE, speeding to takeoff.

      (INT. BOND'S MiG) BOND SHOVES THE THROTTLES TO THE FIREBALL AND -

      THE VIDEO-WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

      KA-BOOM!!!! The scene on the screen erupts in a GIANT EXPLOSION -
      then turns to video-snow. Is Bond alive? No one in London knows.

      HIGH ANGLE - THE AIR BASE -

      The FIREBALL grows and grows, a raging hell. And just when it seems
      no one could possibly survive: BOND'S MiG ROCKETS OUT OF THE FLAMES!!

      INT. BOND'S MiG -

      Bond thinks he's safe. Sound. Until -

      MiG-2 FLIES OUT OF THE FIREBALL -

      Cannons blazing at 007. A hail of metal and tracers.

      INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

      Bond goes into evasive maneuvers - jinks right, jinks left - when,
      suddenly, THE COPILOT REVIVES, and starts trying to STRANGLE Bond
      with a METAL LANYARD. Struggling, Bond HEARS a THIN HIGH-PITCHED
      TONE -

      INT./EXT. MIG-2

      The pilot has locked onto Bond's MiG. Boom! TWO HEAT-SEEKING
      MISSILES roar away.

      INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

      Fighting the garrote, Bond KICKS THE THROTTLES forward and PULLS BACK
      ON THE YOKE. The MiG goes into a spine crushing climb as -

      THE TWO HEAT SEEKING MISSILES FOLLOW HIM, LOOPING UPWARD.

      INT. MIG-2 -

      Bond's MiG has disappeared from the pilot's view: Not in front. Not
      on the left. Not on the right. Where did he go? The pilot looks up:

      BOND'S MIG APPEARS, FLYING INVERTED, COCKPIT DOWN, 10 FEET ABOVE MIG-2.

      THE PILOT OF MIG-2 IS STUNNED.

      INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

      Fighting against the garrote, Bond strains to reach a RED BUTTON on
      the panel: COPILOT EJECTOR SEAT.

      Bond finally taps it, and - THE BACK HALF OF THE CANOPY BLOWS OFF!

      The COPILOT BLASTS OUT OF THE PLANE, DOWNWARD, directly into MIG-2's
      cockpit. Bond peels off.

      For a second, MiG-2 hangs in the air. Until... BOOM!!! The TWO HEAT
      SEEKING MISSILES BLAST IT TO SMITHEREENS.

      Back in MiG-1, Bond fiddles with the radio.

      MI-6 - SITUATION ROOM -

                              BOND'S VOICE
                 Seven to base. I have a full
                 house. Your bid.

      The situation room erupts in cheers.

      RETURN ON BOND IN THE MIG -

                              BOND
                 By the way: Thank the General for all
                 his "assistance." Over and out.

      EXT. BOND'S MIG -

      Goes to AFTERBURNERS. And from the fiery glow of the engine, we
      DISSOLVE TO:

      THE 007 GUN BARREL. MAIN CREDITS.

      After credits, fade in on:

      EXT. OXFORD COLLEGE - DAY

      All ivy and bricks... And a certain Aston-Martin DB-5, parked.

      INT. BOOK LINED OFFICE -

      Afterglow: Empty champagne bottle. Rumpled sheets on a sleeper sofa.
      Bond is in bed with a smart, IRONIC, (and, yes, stunning,) 30-ish
      Chinese woman, JENNY WU. (NOTE: The Chinese here is Mandarin, spelled
      phonetically.)

                              BOND
                       (running a finger across her lips)
                 ... And what do you call these?

                              JENNY WU
                 Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.

                              BOND
                 Indeed they are.
                       (kisses them, lightly)
                 Deadly little things.

      She laughs. His hand goes beneath the sheets.

                              BOND
                 And what do you call these? The Gang
                 of Two?

                              JENNY WU
                       (smacking his hand, laughing:)
                 Stop it!

                              BOND
                 I was just getting to the interesting part!

                              JENNY WU
                 We've already done the interesting
                 part. Do you forget?

                              BOND
                 Remind me.

      He moves to roll on top of her, but she pushes him off, teasing:

                              JENNY WU
                 Sakwa!

                              BOND
                 Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?

                              JENNY WU
                 Mandarin. You jerk.
                       (tousling his hair)
                 I'm late. I have to get dressed.

      She hops off the bed, leaving frame. Bond settles back on the
      headboard, ready to enjoy the view... When his CELL PHONE RINGS.

                              BOND
                       (lightly)
                 Hello -
                       (catching himself)
                 Hello.

      INT. M'S ANTEROOM - MI-6.

      MONEYPENNY, at her desk.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Hello, James. I hope I'm
                 interrupting something important.

      INT. OFFICE - (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

      (Jenny has a leg on the bed, pulling on a full Victoria's Secret
      outfit: Nylons, garter/suspenders, bustier, etc.)

                              BOND
                 Not at all, Moneypenny. I was just
                 brushing up on a little Chinese.

      (In the background, Jenny insists "I am not little.")

                              MONEYPENNY
                 I'm sure she is, James. But I'm
                 afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the
                 rest of your lessons this afternoon.

                              BOND
                       (mock chagrin)
                 Moneypenny... Here I was, finally
                 getting a feel for a new tongue -

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Four o'clock. M will meet you in the
                 conference room.

      Bond watches with amusement as Jenny Wu slips a Graduation-type gown
      over the lingerie. No dress.

                              BOND
                 4:30. It may take me a little longer
                 to wrap things up here.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Four o'clock. Don't be late.

                              BOND
                       (hanging up:)
                 Tsi tien, Chien-penny.

      ON MONEYPENNY:

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Ah, James. You always were a cunning
                 linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.

      Moneypenny hangs up, looks up, and blanches: M is standing there.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Don't ask.

                              M
                 Don't tell.
                       (walking away)
                 I don't want to know.

      INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE JENNY'S OFFICE - OXFORD -

      Bond and Jenny Wu emerge from the office. (She's still in the gown.)
      They pass a flock of young students:

                              STUDENT
                 Good afternoon, Professor Wu.

                              JENNY WU
                 Good afternoon.
                       (then to Bond)
                 Are you sure you can't stay for the
                 lecture?

                              BOND
                 I can't. But I did enjoy the dress
                 rehearsal.

      She gives him a wry glance, opens a door to a lecture hall.

                              JENNY WU
                 Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.

                              BOND
                 Tsi tien, Professor Wu.

      She exits; Bond walks off, passing underneath a WALL MOUNTED TV SET.

      ON THE TV SET - The HNN Globe Logo - The Harmsway News Network -
      spins into view, followed by:

                              HNN ANCHOR
                 You're watching HNN, the Harmsway 24

      EXT. MI-6 LONDON - DAY

      The DB-5 drives past the guard.

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

      Debriefing: Bond, M, and several others listen as NATO COLONEL
      DOMINIQUE EVERHART, (early 30's, Belgian,) refers to video clips from
      the Khyber Pass sequence:

                              COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
                 To sum up: After analyzing the tire
                 inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6
                 video tape, NATO believes the "red
                 box contains approximately eighty
                 kilograms of U235 weapons grade
                 uranium - an incredibly hard,
                 incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal
                 substance.

                              M
                 And that's enough enriched uranium to
                 produce how many nuclear devices?

                              COL. DQMINIQUE EVERHART
                 Depending on the builder's sophistication
                 - one crude bomb that could devastate
                 London, Paris, New York, Berlin - or all
                 four if they have the latest technology.

      There's a pregnant pause in the room.

                              M
                 And the participants?

                              COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
                       (pointing at the screen)
                 Kim Dae Yung. Moscow-trained North
                 Korean nuclear weapons specialist;
                 apparently fell out of favor with the
                 current North Korean regime after a
                 botched attempt to steal fissionable
                 material from a British light-water
                 reactor in South Africa - an accident
                 that left him entirely hairless...

      Another face appears on the screen:

                              COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (cont'd)
                 And Rendera Sikrahm, also known as
                 Richard Stamper. Freelance mercenary,
                 Laos and Cambodia. His father was
                 from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con-
                 scripted by the British government to
                 fight in China during World War II -
                 after which the family settled in
                 Hong Kong, where the young Stamper
                 was undoubtedly treated like a second
                 class citizen by both the Hong Kong
                 Chinese, and local British.
                       (beat, aside:)
                 We've all read about the signs at the
                 British swimming pools in Hong Kong
                 that said "No Ghurka's allowed."

                              BOND
                 Nothing like a little imperialism to
                 promote loyalty among the faithful.

                              COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
                       (stifles a smile, then:)
                 In conclusion: Both these men have a
                 vendetta against the world. They are
                 nuclear armed, and dangerous. And
                 having failed to get the UZ35 through
                 the old opium route - the Khyber Pass
                 - it's NATO's belief that their next
                 attempt will be through Bulgaria -
                 where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force
                 will be there to stop them.

                              M
                 Thank you Colonel Everhart.
                       (stands, turns to:)
                 007, I'd like to see you in my office.
                 Why don't you and the Colonel exchange
                 numbers if you need more information?

                              BOND
                 Yes, M.

      M exits. Bond approaches Dominique. She smiles, warmly. There's a
      mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken.

                              BOND
                 Interesting presentation.

                              DOMINIQUE
                 Interesting video tape.

                              BOND
                 They point, I shoot.

                              DOMINIQUE
                       (feels her pockets)
                 Do you have a pen? I just got promoted
                 and don't have my new cards yet.

                              BOND
                 Of course.

      Bond hands her a PEN. She regards it cautiously.

                              DOMINIQUE
                 ... Does this do anything?

                              BOND
                 Depends what number you write.

      She gives him a wry look; starts to write. He notes her WEDDING BAND.

                              BOND
                 Married?

                              DOMINIQUE
                 Happily.

                              BOND
                 ... Kids?

                              DOMINIQUE
                 Three. You? Married?

                              BOND
                 No.

                              DOMINIQUE
                       (smiles)
                 I didn't think so.

      For an instant, something crosses Bond's face: Bittersweetness? Re-
      morse? Either way, she's scored a subtle victory.

                              DOMINIQUE
                 Here. I gave you my assistant's
                 phone number. If it's urgent, she
                 knows where to reach me.

                              BOND
                 Thanks.
                       (beat, holding her gaze)
                 Take care -

                              DOMINIQUE
                 You too.

      With a Sphinx-like smile, she watches Bond leave.

      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Where Bond encounters MONEYPENNY, also walking to M's office.

                              BOND
                 Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting
                 like this. They may be on to us.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?

                              BOND
                 In the darkest moments, it's what I
                 live for. Especially since I've
                 heard how much you like to watch...
                 On the hidden camera.

      Moneypenny cuts Bond a look - and, in the background, sees Dominique
      leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them.

                              MONEYPENNY
                 By the way, James: Ordinarily I would
                 never ask, but... Weren't you and
                 that Colonel once stranded on a raft
                 for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?

                              BOND
                 Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have
                 you ever known me to kiss and tell?

      They've come to a security door. She punches in a code -

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Actually, I've never known you to do
                 either... But -

                              BOND
                 - We all want what we can't have?

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Not all of us, 007.

      The door opens. They go into:

      INT. M'S ANTEROOM (MONEYPENNY'S AREA) - CONTINUOUS

                              BOND
                 What - no lust for adventure?

                              MONEYPENNY
                 No, 007. It's just that I've learned
                 from personal experience - that when
                 we get what we want -
                       (beat)
                 Somehow the reality is never as...
                 Satisfying as the fantasy.

      Bond scowls. Moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door:

                              MONEYPENNY
                 Don't keep M waiting.

      INT. M'S OFFICE - DAY

      M is behind her desk; MINISTER PETER JOHNSTONE sits across - a high-
      handed Teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of
      plutonium. They've been arguing.

                              M
                 Come in, 007. You know the Minister?

                              BOND
                 Of course.
                       (nods to)
                 Minister Johnstone.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 007.

      Bond sits in an armchair. M presses a button, and a video/bio of
      ELIOT HARMSWAY appears on the wall behind her. Mid-50's, regal.

                              M
                 Tell me, 007, what do you know about
                 Elliot Harmsway?

                              BOND
                       (quipping)
                 Only what I read in the newspapers.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (disdainfully)
                 His newspapers?

                              BOND
                       (glancing sideways)
                 Occasionally, yes.
                       (directly to M)
                 British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong;
                 controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable,
                 satellites; books, magazines, movies,
                 computer software. Theme parks.

                              M
                       (holding up a copy of:)
                 - Along with Tomorrow - the first
                 world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27
                 million. Daily. -

                              BOND
                 'Able to topple governments with a single
                 story' - as he says in his press.

                              JOHNSTONE
                       (hurrumph)
                 Exactly.

      Bond looks at Johnstone quizzically. Then a very tight-lipped M. He
      senses he's about to enter a minefield:

                              BOND
                 ... What's Harmsway done?

                              M
                 It seems, 007, we've received a tip

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 A rumor - from an anonymous source -

                              M
                 - that Sir Elliot may be involved
                 with Stamper and Yung, and the
                 missing Uranium.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 Hearsay. Idle chatter from a source
                 you can't identify - who insists on
                 talking only to 007. Nothing but
                 loose talk and innuendo.

                              M
                 That may be the case at present,
                 Minister Johnstone... But our own
                 sources suspect that Mr. Harmsway
                 used his considerable Russian media
                 - holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky
                 President of the Ukraine - in trade
                 for the uranium.

      (M has punched a button, and Valentin's video bio has appeared.)

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.

                              BOND
                 Perhaps. But it does explain how an
                 ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms
                 dealer is suddenly portrayed as a
                 long-time friend of the people.
                       (beat)
                 If you believe what you read in the papers.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (annoyed)
                 Need I remind the two of you that
                 Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway
                 - is directly descended from the Earl
                 of Aberdeen? That his Scottish
                 ancestors practically invented Hong
                 Kong - and out of sheer gratitude,
                 Queen Victoria herself named the port
                 "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?

                              M
                       (long pause, then:)
                 ... No more than I need remind you,
                 Minister, that merely being a member
                 of the lucky sperm club - does not
                 preclude one from a life of criminal
                 activity.

      Johnstone is reeling. M continues, to Bond, with aplomb:

                              M
                 The reason I invited the Minister
                 here, 007, was to reassure him that
                 this investigation will be handled
                 with the utmost discretion.

                              BOND
                 Of course.

                              M
                 Which is also why I've withheld this
                 information from NATO and our allies.

                              BOND
                       (nods, then, recalling)
                 ... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?

                              M
                 Yes. 1988. He was furious at the
                 British plan to return Hong Kong, and
                 supposedly started his own negotiations
                 with the Chinese Government. The inquiry
                 went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a
                 rather powerful enemy -

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 Not to mention the chaos it caused at
                 Whitehall when his newspapers began
                 screaming for the recall of the
                 sitting government.

                              M
                       (a beat, then:)
                 I'm sending you to Venice, 007.
                 You're to check out the source,
                 determine whether Elliot Harmsway is
                 involved with the enriched uranium,
                 and, if so, stop him.

                              BOND
                 How will I meet the informant?

      She hands Bond a CARNIVAL MASK:

                              M
                 You're to wear this mask at the Venice
                 Carnival, and wait to be contacted.

                              BOND
                 I understand.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (standing, to leave)
                 There is one last thing, 007: Elliot
                 Harmsway is vital to the economic
                 interests of this nation. He's also
                 a major contributor to the party. I
                 expect him to be given every consideration.

                              BOND
                 Political considerations?

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 To the best of my recollection, Mr.
                 Bond, I suggested no such thing.
                       (beat, at the door)
                 In fact, I was never here.

      And he exits. M, frowning, hits a button on her intercom:

                              M
                 Would you send in the new man from
                 equipment branch?

                              MONEYPENNY (O.S.)
                 Right away.

                              BOND
                 .... I hate to ask, but... Did you
                 ever think you'd miss Communism?

                              M
                 We serve the interests of the British
                 people, 007. No matter who we may be
                 foolish enough to elect.

      Bond is silent, chastised. M looks away, then looks back:

                              M
                 But if Elliot Harmsway is involved
                 with that uranium, I want him
                 prosecuted to the ends of the earth.

                              BOND
                 Hopefully, it won't get that far.

      M looks up: MALCOLM SAUNDERS, Q's successor, limps in, looking like a
      mummy - plaster casts on his left leg, left arm; neck-brace, crutch.

                              M
                 Come in, Saunders.

                              SAUNDERS
                 M. 007.

                              BOND
                 Okay, Saunders. What is it this
                 time? Rocket in the leg? Machine
                 pistol in the arm?

                              SAUNDERS
                 Q's retirement party. I'd just put
                 the knife into the cake, and -

                              BOND
                 Come on. I know better than that -

      Bond thwacks the crutch against the leg. Saunders GRIMACES IN PAIN.

                              BOND
                 It must do something.

                              SAUNDERS
                 Well... If you insist.

      Saunders flexes his broken arm; ARMORED SPIKES pop out of the it.

                              BOND
                 The die is cast.

      Saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with M. He takes off the cast
      and neck-brace, and places a BRIEFCASE on M's desk.

                              SAUNDERS
                 Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much
                 time to demonstrate your new Q toys.

                              BOND
                 How is old Q?

                              SAUNDERS
                 Gone fishing.

                              BOND
                 Fishing?

                              SAUNDERS
                 Big game fishing.
                       (beat)
                 Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift
                 from his friends at the CIA.

      Saunders has opened the briefcase. Bond tries to look inside, but
      Saunders repositions it. Saunders continues:

                              SAUNDERS
                 In the meantime, perhaps this will
                 spark your interest.
                       (takes out a disposable lighter)
                 Cigarette lighter. Thumb here, press here -

      A small flame appears. Bond, unimpressed, reaches for it -

                              BOND
                 Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -

                              SAUNDERS
                 Not from forty feet.

      Saunders flips the lighter sideways and - WHOOSH! A burst of flame
      shoots across the room.

                              SAUNDERS
                 The disposable lighter also contains
                 a small self-detonation charge
                       (beat)
                 Depending on who - or what - you
                 wish to dispose of.

      Bond takes the lighter, begins to play with it...

                              SAUNDERS
                 Stop fidgeting, 007. Next -

      He takes out a pair of SHOELACES.

                              BOND
                 ... Shoelaces?

                              SAUNDERS
                 Plastique explosive shoelaces.
                       (holding them out at length)
                 Cut them to regulate the size of the
                 blast; totally harmless until you
                 attach the detonator hidden in the
                 heel of your shoe.

                              BOND
                       (examining them curiously)
                 Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty'
                 problem?

                              SAUNDERS
                       (frowns)
                 Moving along -
                       (he produces:)
                 A typical plastic security card.
                 Name here, magnetic information
                 stripe here -
                       (pointing to)
                 And a code breaking microprocessor
                 here. Swipe it through any card
                 reader - anywhere - you're in.

                              BOND
                 Does it work on cash machines?

      Saunders is suddenly stricken. Flustered. He blurts out:

                              SAUNDERS
                 It was an authorized test. I returned the money.

                              BOND
                       (amused)
                 I see...

                              SAUNDERS
                       (ignoring this)
                 Finally, your new watch: Blue laser
                 here for signaling or burning
                 through locks; press this button, the
                 sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.

                              BOND
                       (needling him)
                 If you can't do the time, don't do
                 the crime?

                              SAUNDERS
                       (smirks at Bond, pauses, then)
                 Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last
                 thing: Before Q retired, he asked that
                 I give you one other protective device.

      He hands Bond a WEDDING BAND.

                              BOND
                 A wedding band??? What am I supposed
                 to be able to do with this?

                              SAUNDERS
                 I believe Q's exact words were:
                       (imitating Q, emphatically:)
                 "Hopefully, nothing."

      Bond turns from Saunder's devious grin to an amused M. Smiles:

                              BOND
                 ...I'll give you a ring from Venice.

                              M
                 Good luck on your mission, 007.

      He snaps the ring down on her desk.

                              BOND
                 Till death do us part.

                                                                    CUT TO:

      EXT. VENICE HARBOR/GRAND CANAL - NIGHT

      A GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge
      tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (Harmsway's SEA DOLPHIN II.)

      Tonight, however, we find a GONDOLA, gliding through the water...

      Arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed
      partygoers and musicians in medieval garb.

      Wearing the mask from M's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond
      alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd.

      EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - NIGHT

      A swirl of colors, noise and music. Pushing his way into the chaotic
      celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face:

      NOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS. White. Yellow. Red. Blue.

      Caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right,
      anxiously looking for the contact. Who is it?

      THREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond. They curtsy, and giggle.

                              WOMAN
                 Buona sera, signore -

      He's spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle.

                              MAN
                 Vino?

      Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a
      group of celebrants carrying a long banner.

      Suddenly, the CROWD SURGES FORWARD: A PROCESSION, carrying the
      EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square.

      Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look
      forward - left, right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from behind.
      He can only crane his neck to see/hear -

                              MASKED WOMAN
                 I may have been followed. Meet me at
                 the Church in five minutes!

      With an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save
      the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks
      behind him.

      SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT

      Five minutes later. Almost deserted. A few stray couples. The
      MASKED WOMAN appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and
      the moonlight, looking for Bond. Suddenly -

      Whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove.

                              BOND
                 Looking for someone?

      Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - PARIS
      removes her mask. She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007:

                              PARIS
                 Hello, James.

      Bond reacts. He is not happy to see her.

                              BOND
                 Paris?!? What are you doing here?

                              PARIS
                 Is that any way to say hello?

                              BOND
                 I thought your specialty was good-bye.

      Paris smiles coyly. She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair -

                              PARIS
                 Oh, James. I've missed you -

                              BOND
                       (grabbing her by the wrist)
                 Is this another one of your games?

                              PARIS
                 Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't
                 you just be nice?

                              BOND
                 I've got half the British government
                 breathing down my neck. I don't have
                 time for your nonsense.

      She's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness.

                              PARIS
                 Don't you even miss me? Didn't I
                 mean anything to you?

                              BOND
                 Nothing.

      She turns away from him, fighting back tears. Bond doesn't care:

                              BOND
                 What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is
                 this just another one of your stunts?

                              PARIS
                       (anguished)
                 No! He's crazy - he's insane. He
                 hates everybody. He's got these
                 plans -
                       (facing Bond, becoming hysterical:)
                 You've got to help me, James. I'm
                 sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I
                 know I was wrong - but you've got to
                 protect me. I know you still love -

      BOND SLAPS HER. She's stunned. He waits. She's angered:

                              PARIS
                 Do you feel better now?

                              BOND
                       (not giving an inch)
                 Do you?

      She turns away. Bond feels remorse for hitting her. Softens:

                              BOND
                 What about the uranium?

                              PARIS
                 It's on the boat. He's holding a
                 press conference tomorrow.

      Bond reaches out to touch her. She falls into his arms, burying her
      face in his shoulder.

                              PARIS
                 I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll
                 never leave you again.

                              BOND
                       (patting her head)
                 Shhhhh...

                              PARIS
                 Just hold me.

      Bond thinks for a moment, then gently pushes her away, a foot
      backwards, to look in her eyes:

                              BOND
                 How do you know Harmsway?

      Paris' eyes flicker at something over Bond's shoulder. She swoons:

                              PARIS
                 Kiss me.

      She pulls Bond to her, kissing him - then HAULS OFF, BELTING him
      across the mouth.

                              PARIS
                 Bastard! Leave me alone!

      She shoves him off, darts away. Bond is bleeding from his mouth -
      and not altogether surprised at her behavior. He turns to see -

      ANOTHER ANGLE - SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - (BOND'S POV) -

      Paris running to FOUR MEN dressed alike in three-corner hats,
      enveloped from head-to-foot in BLACK CAPES. Their faces are
      completely concealed behind flat, bone-white masks covering all but
      their chins. They look like messengers of death.

      CLOSER ON PARIS AND THE MEN -

      The leader is STAMPER; the others are locals, THUG #1, #2, #3. (THUG
      #1 is built like a bank vault.) Stamper looks steadily at Bond

                              STAMPER
                 Who is he?

                              PARIS
                 Nobody. Just some drunk. Leave him
                 alone -

                              STAMPER
                       (to Thug #3)
                 Take her to the boat.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      He sees STAMPER and the TWO HENCHMEN approaching. He turns and walks
      quickly toward -

      EXT. RIALTO BRIDGE - FIRST (UP) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

      Pushing past carnival-goers, Bond rushes up the central staircase of
      the bridge. At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees -

      THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION, approaching like a tidal wave.

      BOND throws a look over his shoulder, and SEES THE THREE MEN, rushing
      up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins -
      completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top.

      BOND turns to face the men... And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP,
      dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession.

      STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -

      And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY, just as the PROCESSION SURGES
      PAST HIM, and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper & Co.

                              BOND
                       (to himself, flexing the cape)
                 So that's how he does it.

      Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd.

      Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but
      Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.

      RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

      As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:

      THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing
      carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -

      But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes
      right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,
      pulling the men down, after him.

      BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT

      Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:

      A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -

      and just beyond this -

      A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.

      BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the
      picture for him.

                              BOND
                 Prego, prego. Permissio.

                              TOURIST
                 Grazie.

      Bond takes the camera. The tourists pose. And with perfect timing,
      Bond turns, and - POP! - sets off the FLASHBULB in THUG #l's face
      just as he comes around the corner.

      Bond flips the camera back to the tourist -

                              BOND
                 Grazie -

      And heads for the PUSHCART. Wheeling it around, he SHOVES IT at the
      thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb.

      The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart
      stops on top of him, pinning him down.

      BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.

      Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS
      in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed
      off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -

      007 disappears down the sidestreet.

      Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO
      MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of
      the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT
      INTO THE CANAL.

      RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -

      Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug
      #1 disappear onto the side Street.

      Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course
      along the canals toward -

      THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT

      Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street. Sticking close
      to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway.

      ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -

      Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza.

      BOND'S POV - THE PLAZA

      Stamper and Thug 2 charge in. Bond watches as they split up and
      start looking for him.

      RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -

      Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:

      THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast
      move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing
      it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from
      under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.
      (He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.)

      NEW ANGLE -

      Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the
      courtyard of Il Bovolo.

      RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -

      Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he
      pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the
      cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -

      The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,
      hurling him against the opposite wall.

      With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands.

                              THUG #2
                 Marco - I didn't know -

                              THUG #1
                 After him!

      They charge off.

      IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT

      Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No
      way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH
      FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.

      THE SPIRAL STAIRS -

      Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.

      RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -

      The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR
      BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.

      THE BALCONY -

      Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the
      building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the
      courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.

      Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.

      Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the
      GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and
      disappears from sight...

      Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.

      FIRST ROOFTOP -

      Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are
      SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop
      to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.

      SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

      007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold
      on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:
      The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.

      As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -

      RETURN ON THE BALCONY -

      Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy
      to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.

      FIRST ROOFTOP -

      Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the
      next building. He makes a running leap.

      SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

      Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They
      grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the
      roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.

      AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the
      skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.

      007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1
      tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO
      BOND'S LEGS.

      They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the
      two of them fall -

      CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -

      VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.

      They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the
      Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the
      collar, hauling him up on his feet.

      Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up
      on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:

                              THUG #1
                 I owe you some pain.

      With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his
      gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just
      clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.

      The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,
      and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.

      As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally
      (yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.

      With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.
      He's having fun.

      AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -

      THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.

      BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out
      of the way, like a gnat.

      Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from
      the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.

      Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,
      and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword.

      With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.
      The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:

      A DISPLAY WALL -

      filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.
      (Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks.
      Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.

      THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug
      #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.

      NEW ANGLE -

      Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond
      backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.
      (Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.)

      Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the
      last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from
      killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.

      As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A
      studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)

      Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN
      TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.

      Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the
      wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM
      THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  -

      In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1
      backwards, down onto the floor.

      AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -

      THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR.

      BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE:

      THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM.

      And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE
      IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and -

      NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV -

      The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still
      clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it.

                              BOND
                 He fought hard...
                       (holstering the gun)
                 But the case was terminal.

      And on this note, we -

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. VENICE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY -

      Under a beautiful blue sky, the gleaming white SEA DOLPHIN II sits at
      dock, festooned with pennants and banners. There's a crowd onboard.
      At the same time, however, 500 feet away...

      INT. DOCKSIDE CAFE -

      Bond meets with Signore DiGIACOMO, a middle-aged Italian Intelligence
      official in shirtsleeves. Two underlings hover in the background.

                              BOND
                 You've confirmed all the legal
                 details with M?

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Si. Bueno. She's very...
                 'Competent.' ...For a woman.

                              BOND
                 Let's go over this one more time.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 You will investigate the boat.
                 You'll signal us if you find the
                 enriched uranium. And then -
                       (distracted)
                 Pardon.

      He looks at a WOMAN who has appeared with a baby in her arms.

                              ITALIAN WOMAN W/BABY
                 Don Franco. I just want to say we're
                 voting for you in the election.

                              DiGIACOMO
                       (teasing, re: the baby)
                 Both of you?

                              ITALIAN WOMAN W/BABY
                       (laughs)
                 Of course.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Grazie, grazie. Ciao.

      She leaves. He turns back Bond:

                              DiGIACOMO
                 So. You'll signal us if you find the
                 uranium -

                              BOND
                 And you'll wait until after the press
                 conference - and everyone is gone -
                 before you board the boat and arrest
                 him.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Perfecto. Then we turn him over to you,
                 and the English government puts him on a
                 military transport back to London.

      Bond nods, looks over at the Sea Dolphin II.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Do not worry, my friend. I only want
                 what is best. For both of us.

      Bond stands to leave. DiGiacomo smiles after 007 - as if he's
      savoring some private secret. He snaps his fingers to an underling:

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Rocco! Un Cappuccino!

      THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      As Bond makes his way up the gangplank -

      ELLIOT HARMSWAY is holding a press conference near the bow, surround-
      ed by dignitaries. He is a man with an EVIL EUPHORIA - showing off
      all the charm and charisma that's made him one of the world's most
      powerful media tycoons.

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...And so, it's somewhat fitting that
                 we are here today... To christen this
                 environmental research boat in Venice -
                 - 'Venezia' - the port where Marco
                 Polo sailed forth to explore the
                 world's great uncharted oceans...
                       (beat)
                 That 2/3 of the earth's surface where
                 the sharks are not working members of
                 the press.

      Laughter. Bond studies the man. Harmsway continues, pointing to a
      LARGE DRILL/BORING OBJECT, the size of a jet engine, attached to a
      long flexible hose/tube.

                              HARMSWAY
                 With our six custom designed sea-bed
                 coring drills, we will probe the
                 long-term effects of pollution; our
                 sonars, radars, and research labs
                 will study the wind, the water, and
                 the sea life that so dearly feeds us.

      Bond moves through the crowd. He spots a bulkhead, with a door.

                              HARMSWAY
                 And so, in the spirit of international
                 cooperation - thanking my good friend,
                 Valentin Zukofsky - the newly elected
                 President of the Ukraine for all his
                 assistance -

      He motions to Zukofsky, who nods to the audience...

                              HARMSWAY
                 I give this boat to mankind - selflessly
                 - in pure charity asking nothing for
                 myself... But the cable TV rights.

      Big laugh from the assemblage. Harmsway turns to a BEAUTY QUEEN:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Miss Venice? If you'll do the honors -

      SMASH! She cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow. CHEERS!

                              HARMSWAY
                 Now I'll take some questions from the
                 press - even the few of you who
                 aren't on my payroll.

      Laughter. Harmsway points to a reporter:

                              REPORTER #1
                 Mr. Harmsway: Why did you name this
                 boat the Sea Dolphin II?

                              HARMSWAY
                 Actually, my first choice was 'No
                 Comment.' So if someone asked where
                 I was, I could truthfully respond 'No
                 Comment.'
                       (laughter; he points)
                 Over there.

                              REPORTER #2
                 Sir Elliot: Is it true you're in
                 negotiations to move your offices
                 from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur?

                              HARMSWAY
                       (impishly)
                 No comment.

      Amidst more laughter, Bond disappears into the bulkhead door.

      INT. SEA DOLPHIN II - BELOW DECKS -

      Bond moves cautiously down a STAIRCASE...

      And peers along a CORRIDOR. He sees a GUARD, checking doors, making
      sure they're locked. Bond withdraws for a moment, looks back: The
      guard is at the far end of the hall. He lifts a WALKIE-TALKIE:

                              GUARD
                 Level one, secure.

      The guard exits, down another staircase. Bond moves stealthily down
      the corridor, glancing at signs on various doors: FISH HATCHERY,
      WEATHER STATION, CREW'S MESS, etc... Until he comes to:

      METALLURGY LAB. There's a CARD READER by the door. Bond slips out
      his Q-toy, swipes it. Click. He goes inside.

      INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - CONTINUOUS

      Bond clocks the lab: Power tools, test benches, a SECOND ENTRY
      DOOR... And in the middle of the room -

      THE RED BOX.

      Quickly, (as the echoes of Harmsway's press conference can be heard
      through the portholes,) Bond examines the edges of the box, looking
      for tamper-proof seals. Finds none. Gingerly, he opens it:

      URANIUM SLUGS. They look like black tennis ball canisters.

      BOND presses a button on his watch: THE GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS WILDLY
      Bond pauses. Wants to make sure. He spots ANOTHER GEIGER COUNTER on
      a bench; he moves its probe over the uranium slugs: Same result.

      Bond closes the box. He decides to check out the rest of the room -
      examining gadgets, tools, chemicals. HE OPENS A SHALLOW DRAWER -

      And finds a set of BLACK ROTARY CUTTING SAWS, WITH ELONGATED TEETH.
      (They look almost like a series of sharks' jaws - one oval set inside
      another )

      Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight. He wonders what it
      is used for. Just then -

      THERE'S A CLICK AT THE SECOND DOOR. Bond quickly replaces the
      cutting saw, moves to the first door -

      And as the SECOND DOOR OPENS, Bond slips out the first, into the
      CORRIDOR, down the hall, heading for the stairs.

      BACK IN THE METALLURGY LAB -

      YUNG enters, his hairless head shining under the lights. He looks
      around, sensing something is wrong. Glances: Not the red box. Not
      the Geiger counter. But then he notices it:

      THE DRAWER is sticking out, maybe a sixteenth of an inch.

      Yung picks up a telephone.

      SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

      Bond emerges from the bulkhead door. The press conference wrapping
      up. As Bond makes his way to the RAIL, looking out on the cafe -

                              HARMSWAY
                 The maiden voyage begins tonight. I
                 have some business in London - but
                 the ship will sail down the Nile,
                 across the South China Sea, stopping
                 in Australia, winding up in San
                 Francisco.

      Bond stands at the rail, AIMS HIS WATCH at the cafe -

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 But having said that - let's get to
                 the real business - the only thing
                 that attracts newsmen faster than a
                 breaking story the free food and
                 beverage.

      INT. CAFE -

      DiGiacomo sees the BLUE LASER. Motions his men to action.

      RETURN ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

      Bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain
      ac inconspicuous as possible. A hand clasps his shoulder:

                              VALENTIN'S VOICE
                 Mr. James Bond!

      Bond spins to see Valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of
      cheaply dressed goons.

                              BOND
                 Valentin. What an unpleasant surprise.

                              VALENTIN
                 What is it that brings you to
                 Venezia, Mr. Bond? Business -
                       (sly glance to the thugs)
                 Or somebody else's business?

      The goons chortle. Bond isn't happy with this attention. He clocks
      a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS, scanning the deck.

      A WOMAN'S SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin. She
      is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos.

                              SOFIA
                 Dimitri!!! You promised I could go
                 shopping!!

                              VALENTIN
                       (sotto, to Bond)
                 New mistress.
                       (to her, impatiently)
                 So? Go!

                              SOFIA
                 I need money.

      Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH.

                              VALENTIN
                 Here. Take an inch.

      Shaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond:

                              VALENTIN
                 Come. Let me buy you a drink. It's
                 free.

      With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move
      several steps to the bar.

                              VALENTIN
                       (to the bartender)
                 Two vodka martini's. Shaken. Not stirred.
                       (to Bond)
                 And you?

      Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his
      regular behavior might arouse suspicion.

                              BOND
                 One.

      As the bartender pours:

                              BOND
                 I must say, Valentin, capitalism
                 seems to be treating you well.

                              VALENTIN
                       (belting one back)
                 I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes.
                       (then)
                 Off the record.

                              BOND
                 Of course. If you can't beat the
                 government, you might as well own it.

      Valentin spots someone off-camera.

                              VALENTIN
                 Wait - I want you to meet a friend of
                 mine.
                       (calling out)
                 Elliot! Elliot! Come here.

      Harmsway appears. Ebullient as ever.

                              VALENTIN
                 Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce
                 you to an old friend -

                              BOND
                       (putting out a hand to shake)
                 The name is Bond. James Bond.

      Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile. Yet his words are ambiguous:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Always nice to meet one of her
                 Majesty's fellow subjects...
                       (a nod to Valentin)
                 Especially one with such
                 distinguished friends.

                              BOND
                 You might say I've always been one of
                 Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.

                              VALENTIN
                       (chortling)
                 'Biggest followers?' He's
                 practically made a career' of it!!

      He laughs. Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain.

                              BOND
                 It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot.
                 Practically glows in the dark.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (smiles)
                 I can tell you're a man with an eye
                 for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.
                       (signaling off camera)
                 Darling! Come here.
                       (beat)
                 I want you to meet my wife.

      A woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. As
      she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce
                 you to James Bond.

      There is a terrified look on her face. Harmsway continues, beaming
      his most insinuating smile:

                              HARMSWAY
                 But then... I believe you two have
                 already met.

      There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. Then -

      POLICE WHISTLES BLOW! SIRENS! SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A HALT!

      The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the
      gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by UZI-
      TOTING CARBINIERI, along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices
                 of the Italian government, I, Franco
                 DiGiacomo -
                       (pauses; smiles at a camera;
                        POP! A flash goes off)
                 Am arresting you for the illegal
                 possession of weapons grade enriched
                 uranium.
                       (to his underlings)
                 Seize the boat!

      A set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway.

                              VALENTIN
                 I think I suddenly remembered an
                 urgent meeting in Moscow.

      To everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws.

                              HARMSWAY
                 My friends, there's been a terrible mistake.
                       (putting his arm around DiGiacomo)
                 Come. Let me show you.

      And he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. Bond is
      left with Paris. She is white with fear. Bond moves to console her:

                              BOND
                 Paris -

                              PARIS
                 Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!

                              BOND
                 Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't
                 it in our files?

                              PARIS
                       (anguished)
                 He didn't want anyone to know. He
                 kept it out of the papers. He said a
                 third wife was bad for his image.
                       (beat)
                 You've got to protect me!

      Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway. He pulls out a key:

                              BOND
                 Go to my hotel room. I'll be there
                 in twenty minutes.

      Paris looks up at him like a hurt child. She wants some contact; she
      wants to hear him say 'I love you.'

                              PARIS
                 Just - say it. Say it just once.

                              BOND
                       (pauses, discomfited)
                 One thing at a time. I'll see you
                 in twenty minutes. Go.

      She exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... And we pan up to see the
      SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, following him.

      INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway holds court near the red box. Bond squeezes in.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I believe this is what you're looking
                 for, Colonel.

      He opens the red box. Hoists out a canister.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch -
                       (runs the Geiger counter over it)
                 It's depleted uranium! Completely
                 safe! A child could sleep on it.

      Bond can't believe what he's seeing. DiGiacomo is mortified.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I received it from the Russian
                 government - a by-product of their
                 nuclear arms program - in the hopes
                 that I could create tools for
                 oceanographic research.
                       (beat)
                 It's what I was talking about:
                 'Swords into plowshares'! The Sprit
                 of International Cooperation!

                              DiGIACOMO
                 Signore Harmsway. A thousand apologies.
                       (snaps his fingers to a lackey:)
                 Give him the video tape.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Please. No harm done, Don Franco. Go
                 upstairs, and enjoy the reception.

      As the room empties, he calls -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Oh - Mr. Bond. One minute.

      Bond approaches him. They're the only people in the room.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.

                              BOND
                 Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?

                              HARMSWAY
                       (icily)
                 A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't
                 screw with a man who buys ink by the
                 ton.
                       (beat)
                 It's deadlier than uranium.

                              BOND
                       (staring him down)
                 We'll see about that.

      Harmsway glances at his watch. Smiles coldly.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Aren't you late for a meeting?

      EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II/HARBOR - DAY

      Bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. Jumps in a gondola.

                              BOND
                 The Danielli. Presto!

      RETURN ON THE METALLURGY LAB -

      Harmsway closes the door. Yung is there.

                              YUNG
                 That was too close.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the
                 message. So will his boss.

      Harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a
      second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I'm going to the plane. Tell the
                 captain to set sail at once.

      EXT. THE DANIELLI HOTEL - DAY

      Bond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby.

      FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -

      Bond appears, rushing up a staircase. He comes to his doorway. It's
      closed, but unlocked.

      INT. BOND'S HOTEL ROOM -

      Bond enters the room. Looks around, calling out -

                              BOND
                 Paris? Paris?

      He sees the French doors open onto the canal. The curtains billowing
      outward. Bond rushes to the window and looks down:

      EXT. GRAND CANAL - BOND'S POV

      Paris Harmsway is dead, floating in the water.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Crushed. Devastated. And to make matters worse:

                              DiGIACOMO'S VOICE
                 Signore Bond?

      Bond turns. A flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo.

                              DiGIACOMO
                 You're under arrest.

                                                                   CUT TO:

      THE SOUTH CHINA SEA - DUSK

      The HMS INDOMITABLE - a 3,300 ton British frigate, surges through the
      water, heading toward the setting sun.

      CLOSER -

      BATTLE-DRESSED ROYAL MARINES patrol the deck; GUNNERY CREWS man the
      weapons. Whatever is going on here, it's not business as usual.'

      INT. BRIDGE - DUSK

      Close on A VERTICAL GLASS MAP. An electronic panel display with a
      BLINKING YELLOW DOT indicates -

                              NAVIGATOR
                 We've cleared Hong Kong harbor, sir.

      THE CAPTAIN nods. Turns to the GPS OFFICER:

                              CAPTAIN
                 Position?

      The GPS officer enters keyboard commands on console marked "GLOBAL
      POSITIONING SATELLITE." He reads out the data:

                              GPS OFFICER
                 Two-two, zed-three, one-five north; a
                 hundred fourteen degrees, five
                 minutes, ten seconds east.

                              CAPTAIN
                 Mark.

                              GPS OFFICER
                 Locked on satellite, sir.

                              CAPTAIN
                 Set course, two-ten degrees, south
                 south east.

                              NAVIGATOR
                 Coming about, sir.

      The Captain is all business - clipped, sober terse. Turns to his
      FIRST OFFICER, hands him a SLIP OF PAPER:

                              CAPTAIN
                 Orders from London: For the next
                 ninety-six hours, we're to run on
                 full radio silence. Double watches,
                 full alert.
                       (beat)
                 We're to send one encrypted positioning
                 burst to London every six hours -
                 otherwise, zero electronic emissions.

      The first officer nods.

                              CAPTAIN (cont'd)
                 Inform the men, then run a surprise
                 inspection. If someone paints us, I
                 don't want this ship showing up on their
                 radar screen like some god-damned
                 Harrod's Christmas tree.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Yes, sir!

                              CAPTAIN
                 I'll be in my cabin until oh-six-
                 hundred hours.

      The Captain heads for the door.

                              SECOND OFFICER
                 Captain leaving the bridge.

      The officers salute as he exits. With a shrug, the FIRST OFFICER
      picks up the INTERCOM MICROPHONE:

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Attention all hands. Now hear this...

      INT. CREW'S MESS -

      Crowded with CREW MEMBERS eating, waiting on line for food.

                              FIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM)
                 We will rig immediately for
                 electronic silence. All electronic
                 gear is to be shut down...

      CLOSE ON COOK - KITCHEN -

      At microwave. His finger hovers over button, then stops. He opens
      the door of the microwave and takes out a bowl. Dumps the contents
      on the stove.

      INT. SHIP'S HEAD -

      CREW MEMBER with an ELECTRIC SHAVER.

                              FIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM)
                 All personal radios, video devices
                 and computers will be stowed at once.

      He stops shaving.

      INT. ENGINE ROOM -

      The ENGINEER shouts to his crew, over NOISE OF DIESEL ENGINES:

                              ENGINEER
                 Check the engine baffles; rig the
                 generators for shielded operation.

      RETURN ON THE BRIDGE -

      The First Officer stands next to the Communications Officer.

                              COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
                 Communications set to receive only, sir.

      The First Officer looks over the shoulder of RATING at radar screen.

                              RATING
                 Radar switched to passive mode; sonar
                 re-set to low-power operation.
                       (beat)
                 You couldn't find our signature with
                 a magnifying glass.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Let's hope so.

      The First Officer joins the Second Officer at the windows, scanning
      the horizon with binoculars.

                              SECOND OFFICER
                 Looks like we're in for a long,
                 uncomfortable trip.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 We'll all breathe a lot easier when
                 we get this cargo back to London.

                                                                   CUT TO:

      EXT. MANOR HOUSE - THE COAST OF SCOTLAND - DAY

      THE BAGPIPE AND DRUM CORPS of the Royal Highland Regiment (aka the
      "Black Watch") is playing a FUNERAL DIRGE outside a vast stone house,
      with a HARMSWAY NEWS HELICOPTER on the lawn, and LIMOUSINES, A HEARSE
      and a FLOWER CAR in the driveway.

      SIX MEN IN FORMAL MOURNING ATTIRE are entering the house.

      INT. GRAND ROOM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE -

      A SINGLE WHITE ROSE is added to a pile of white roses in PARIS
      HARMSWAY'S OPEN CASKET.

      REVEAL: We're in mid-procession: The last two (of the six men from
      outside) place roses in the casket...

      Then turn, nodding sorrowfully to ELLIOT HARMSWAY (sitting in the
      front row of a room that's keen turned into a makeshift chapel)...

      And follow hand signals of STAMPER, who motions them THROUGH A DOOR,
      to an unseen room.

      After the last man has paid his respects, HARMSWAY stands, walks to
      the bier, and - wiping away a tear - places a single RED ROSE in his
      dead wife's casket.

      INT. HARMSWAY'S INNER SANCTUM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - DAY

      We're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a
      James Bond movie: Slick, stark, sterile. Steel, glass, chrome.

      The SIX men are seated around a giant conference table, looking
      absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire.

      Elliot Harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the Liechtenstein
      that hangs in the lobby of CAA,) walks to the head of the table,
      takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good morning, Gentlemen. I'm sorry
                 to bring you here under these
                 circumstances, but
                       (beat)
                 Considering our meeting was already
                 scheduled, this was a happy coincidence.

      The men nod. Harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel.

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 Number One, your report?

      A gap-toothed Californian with bland features stands.

                              NUMBER ONE
                 Sir Elliot: The entertainment division
                 is releasing three new animated
                 children's movies this year.
                       (pause)
                 By the time we're finished promoting
                 them on our TV, radio, cable, newspaper,
                 and magazine outlets -
                       (pause)
                 There won't be a parent in the universe
                 who won't feel guilty if they don't take
                 their children to our stores and theme
                 parks to buy the toys, books, video-
                 games and clothing featuring our
                 'lovable little creatures.'
                       (pause)
                 We anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion
                 dollars.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Excellent, Number One. Build a better
                 rat-trap, and the world truly will beat
                 a path to your theme park.
                       (turns to)
                 Number Two?

      A young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like Bill Gates.

                              NUMBER TWO
                 As you're aware, Sir Elliot, our
                 software division has introduced a new
                 computer operating system, Gates '99.
                       (beat)
                 It's deliberately filled with bugs -
                 so people will be forced to buy our
                 upgrades over the next five years.
                       (beat)
                 The window on revenues is 2.8 billion.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Outstanding, Number Two.
                       (beat, remembering:)
                 By the way - Number Five - ?
                       (a man looks up)
                 Who's ahead in the American elections?

                              NUMBER FIVE
                 The Democrat, sir. By nine points.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Maybe it's time to publish that story
                 about his sex life. Even things up.
                 A close race is always better for our
                 TV ratings.

                              NUMBER FIVE
                 Consider him slimed, sir.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Splendid. Next...
                       (with noticeable reserve)
                 Number Three. Your report?

      A SHORT MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN stands. Nervous.

                              NUMBER THREE
                 I regret to inform you, sir, that
                 Saddam Hussein is still demanding a
                 bonus for his role in the Gulf War.

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...Haven't we already paid him for his services?

                              NUMBER THREE
                 Yes, sir. But he still feels his
                 people should share in the increased
                 profits of our news division. He has
                 proposed an additional 500 million
                 dollar payment.

      A pause. The other men in the room shift uncomfortably.

                              HARMSWAY
                 ... And there's no truth that 10% of
                 that money will go into your Swiss
                 bank account?

                              NUMBER THREE
                 No sir! I swear! This is not true!!

                              HARMSWAY
                 You disappoint me, Number Three.

      Harmsway presses a button. Stamper enters. Number Three assumes
      this means death. He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE:

                              NUMBER THREE
                 Please sir. Please -

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...But because I am a just man, I've
                 decided to give Mr. Hussein what he
                 deserves.

      Number Three is confused. Does this mean he's going to live?

                              HARMSWAY
                 Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.

                              NUMBER THREE
                       (overwhelmed with gratitude)
                 Thank you sir! Thank you!

      Harmsway nods, watching him leave:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good-bye, Mr. Azziz.

      And the man is gone. Harmsway turns his attention back to the room:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Let's proceed with new business.

      Harmsway presses another button. The room darkens. The CENTER OF
      THE TABLE OPENS, and a 3-D MAP OF MALAYSIA rises into view.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we
                 are going to initiate phase one of
                 the word's most perfect crime: The
                 biggest theft in the history of mankind.
                       (beat, pointing with a laser)
                 Right here. In the Strait of Malacca.

      EXT. LIMOUSINE - MANOR HOUSE - DAY

      Stamper holds the back door open for Number Three. He gets in.

      INT. LIMOUSINE -

      He seems relieved, until the doors lock, ominously. They drive off.

      EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLAND ROADWAY - (INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - MOVING) DAY

      Number Three fidgets in the back... And notices Stamper smiling at
      him in the REARVIEW MIRROR. He sees Stamper reach INTO HIS JACKET -
      and PANICS! Is he going to get shot? Is it over? He winces, as -

      STAMPER'S HAND SUDDENLY THRUSTS BACKWARD THROUGH THE PARTITION.

                              STAMPER
                 Gum?

      Shaking his head, he pulls out a HANDKERCHIEF to mop the flop sweat.

      RETURN ON THE MANOR HOUSE - FAVORING THE HNN HELICOPTER -

      Amidst ad-libbed 'good-bye's" from the gang of six (now five,)
      Harmsway gets in the waiting HNN chopper. It powers up, takes off.

      EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - SCOTLAND -

      Stamper's limousine parks near a Gulfstream jet. He opens the back
      door for Number Three. At last, the man believes he is safe.

                              NUMBER THREE
                 Thank you! Thank you so much. You
                 must thank Sir Elliot for me.

                              STAMPER
                       (producing a NEWSPAPER)
                 Here. Something to read on the plane.

      Stamper TUCKS THE PAPER FIRMLY UNDER #3'S ARM - and gives him a
      friendly pat on the back, sending him up the stairs.

      At the doorway, Number Three looks back. Stamper smiles, waving:

                              STAMPER
                 Bye-bye.

      INT. GULFSTREAM JET - DAY

      Number Three settles into his seat. The door closes; the engines
      wind up for take-off. He sighs: He's safe. He casually picks up the
      newspaper, snaps open the front page:

      INSERT FRONT PAGE OF HARMSWAY'S "TOMORROW' NEWSPAPER:

      Screaming headline: ISRAELI AGENT REVEALED. There's a FULL COLOR
      PHOTO OF NUMBER THREE underneath.

      Number Three lowers the paper, white as a ghost, and -

      TWO ARABIAN GENTLEMEN (in full burnoose) sit down on either side of
      him. They smile. And on NUMBER THREE'S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM, we

                                                                   CUT TO:

      THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE -

      Moving through FOG in the STRAIT OF MALACCA, night.

      INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

      The room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the Indomita-
      ble's command and control systems.

      At the VERTICAL GLASS MAP, the ship's course has been charted from
      Hong Kong, south, down around Singapore, then north, where the YELLOW
      BLINKING dot indicates it's currently in the Strait of Malacca.

      Standing in front of the map, however, THE NAVIGATION OFFICER seems
      perplexed. He's comparing what's on the screen to a piece of paper
      in his hand. Something is wrong.

                              NAVIGATION OFFICER
                 ... This doesn't make sense. What's
                 our heading now?

      THE HELMSMAN looks down at his compass/auto-pilot.

      INSERT COMPASS/AUTO-PILOT - moving from West to North - then holding
      on a North position.

                              HELMSMAN
                 Zero one three. Due north.

      The two officers share a look. Something is odd, but -

                              HELMSMAN
                 We're on course again.

      Just then, the FIRST OFFICER ENTERS from the exterior bridge.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Can't see a damn thing in this fog.
                       (calling out)
                 Rating: What have we got?

      He joins the RATING and COMMUNICATION'S OFFICERS at their scopes.

                              RATING
                 A passenger ferry and two freighters
                 broadcasting on low-band -

                              COMMUNICATIONS
                 And two small fishing boats about 30k
                 north. No radar, but we've
                 identified their engine signatures.

      As the First Officer takes this in:

                              HELMSMAN (O.S.)
                 Damn. It's doing it again.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (joining him)
                 What's wrong?

                              HELMSMAN
                 About every ninety seconds, the auto-
                 pilot jogs us to the west.

      He points down to the compass/auto-pilot, SWINGING WEST...

                              HELMSMAN
                 Then re-sets us to the north.

      The compass reaches dead west - then starts to swing back NORTH.

                              HELMSMAN (cont'd)
                 The Captain wants us on the East side
                 of the channel. ...Cross current?

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Not in the Strait.
                       (to the Navigator)
                 How's our position?

                              NAVIGATING OFFICER
                 According to the satellite, we're
                 exactly on course.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Did you check the auto-pilot?

                              HELMSMAN
                 The back-up does the same thing.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Check it again. What about the global
                 positioning satellite? Could there be
                 something wrong with the signal?

                              GPS OFFICER
                 Two words: Im-possible.

      EXT. SPACE -

      As the earth turns below, a TINY SILVER DOT appears in the distance:
      A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE, spinning slowly on its axis.

      It comes closer and closer to camera, until it FILLS THE SCREEN, and
      the LOGO on its body ROTATES INTO VIEW:

      HNN. THE HARMSWAY NEWS NETWORK.

      RETURN ON BRIDGE - INT. H.M.S. INDOMITABLE - NIGHT

      THE HELMSMAN finishes fiddling with the auto-pilot.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 How is it now?

                              HELMSMAN
                 Seems to be back to normal, sir.

      The First Officer nods... Then HEARS a SHRILL WARNING BEEP.

                              SONAR OPERATOR
                 I have something off the port bow!

      The First Officer rushes to join him at the screen.

                              SONAR OPERATOR (cont'd)
                 100 meters out, just below the surface.
                       (adjusts the controls)
                 A meter in diameter; ten - twelve
                 meters long. ...Floating vertically?

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 A dead head.
                       (off the others' quizzical looks)
                 Water logged timber. Floats straight
                 up. You sometimes see them on the east
                 side of the channel - from the logging
                 camps on Sumatra - but they don't
                 usually float this far west.
                       (calling out)
                 Muncy! Engines to half!

                              HELMSMAN
                 Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (explaining)
                 Chew up a log like that in the
                 propeller, you end up with enough paperwork
                 to go from here to London. Twice.

      EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

      The ship is moving towards a DARK VERTICAL SHAPE - Harmsway's SEA-BED
      CORE BORING DRILL (shorthand "THE WORM',) attached to a long flexible
      dredging pipe.

      CLOSER - THE HEAD OF THE WORM -

      Motionless, hanging in the water. Then the monster awakes: A metal
      sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle CAMERA LENS.

      INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

      The Communications Officer reacts to his monitor with ALARM:

      COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
      I'm getting an electrical emission,
      sir! Extremely close. Bearing 240 -

      The First Officer is surprised. All hell is about to break loose:       -

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Punch up the radar -

                              RADAR OPERATOR
                 I've got it, sir. A large craft -
                 XX,OOO tons. Range -
                       (disbelief)
                 200 yards? It's anchored in a cove!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 That's impossible! We're in the
                 middle of the channel!

      A Junior officer bursts in from the exterior bridge:

                              JUNIOR OFFICER
                 Breakers off the port bow! We're
                 heading for shore!

                              SONAR OFFICER
                 Sir -

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (reacting to the Jr. Officer)
                 Full stop!!! Call the captain!

                              SONAR OFFICER
                 Sir!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (annoyed)
                 What?!?!

                              SONAR OPERATOR
                 The log is moving!

      EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

      Propelled by water-jets in its head, THE WORM STREAKS TOWARD THE
      INDOMITABLE, emitting a HIGH PITCHED whine as its drill bit revs up
      to speed. The drill's BLACK TEETH glisten in the water.

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, NIGHT)

      Closing in on the hull like a torpedo. It gets closer, picking up
      speed, until - on IMPACT -

      INT. ENGINE ROOM -

      A TORRENT OF WATER engulfs the Engineer and Crewmen when The Worm
      bursts/drills through the hull. As they scream, drowning -

      A CREWMAN ON THE GANTRY scrambles up, one step ahead of the water,
      through a bulkhead, into -

      GENERATOR ROOM - (CONTINUOUS)

      Where the CREWMAN and TWO OPERATORS struggle to CLOSE THE DOOR
      AGAINST THE WATER.

                              SENIOR OPERATOR
                       (on the intercom)
                 We've been hit! We're taking water!

      THE BRIDGE -

      Alarms sound! Red lights flash!

                              DAMAGE CONTROL
                 Flooding in the engine room!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Get me damage reports! Start the pumps!

                              SECOND OFFICER
                       (holding out a ship's phone)

                 It's the Captain -

      PASSAGEWAY #1 -

      On a phone, outside the ship's GYM, deep in the hull:

                              THE CAPTAIN
                 What the hell is going on?!?

                              FIRST OFFICER
                       (intercut if necessary)
                 I think we've been holed, sir!

                              THE CAPTAIN
                 On my way!

      He speeds along the passageway, going through a water-tight door,
      slamming it behind him. Meanwhile, on -

      THE BRIDGE -

                              HELMSMAN
                 The engines are gone!

                              DAMAGE CONTROL
                 Flooding on D deck!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Sound the general alarm! Seal all
                 compartments!

      As the Second Officer grabs the intercom -

                              SECOND OFFICER (into intercom)
                 Attention all hands -

      CREW'S MESS -

      The crew members look up from their meals -

                              SECOND OFFICER (continuing)
                 Proceed to emergency stations -

      GENERATOR ROOM -

      The men have closed the door, but... HEAR A HIGH-PITCHED WHINING,
      GRINDING SOUND from the other side. They exchange a quizzical look;
      they don't know what to make of it, when:

      BANG! The door explodes inward - and a high-pressured stream of
      water blasts in, blowing them back against the walls.

      BRIDGE -

      The lights go out! Everyone is scrambling:

                              SYSTEMS OFFICER
                 We've lost power!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Go to back up generators!

                              SECOND OFFICER (into intercom)
                 Repeat: Seal all compartments, and -

      CREW'S MESS -

      In the dim lighting -

                              SECOND OFFICER (on intercom)
                 Proceed to emergency stations at once!

      The men start to move, but halt at A HUMMING SOUND. They look
      around: Where is it coming from?

      Suddenly a THREE FOOT SECTION OF THE DECK EXPLODES IN A FOUNTAIN OF
      WATER. The men are swept off their feet.

      PASSAGEWAY/GANTRY #2 -

      As the Captain rushes up the steps, he turns around, reacting to a
      GRINDING NOISE -

      CAPTAIN'S POV - THE CLOSED WATER-TIGHT DOOR -

      BOOM! Water blasts through, like 1000 fire hydrants turned on full.

      With terror in his eyes, THE CAPTAIN sprints up the rest of the
      stairs, through a water-tight door, into:

      PASSAGEWAY #3 -

      Where the Captain secures the door behind him, and rushes away.

      THE BRIDGE -

      A desperate battle continues:

                              DAMAGE CONTROL
                 Flooding on C-Deck!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Where the hell are those generators?

                              SYSTEMS ENGINEER
                 Coming up, sir!

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Get those pumps working!

      BATTERY ROOM -

      A CREWMAN hurriedly flips switches. The lights flicker... And just
      as they some to life, brightly -

      THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN, and a wall of water and debris blows in,
      destroying everything in its wake.

      THE BRIDGE -

      Lights out! A sense of helplessness is beginning to fill the room:

                              SYSTEMS CONTROL
                 The back-up is gone!

                              DAMAGE OFFICER
                 Flooding up to B-Deck!

                              HELMSMAN
                 We can't hold out much longer, sir!

      All eyes are on the First Officer. Will he save them?

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Where the hell is the Captain?!?!

      THE CAPTAIN (PASSAGEWAY #3) -

      Running, the Captain is about to reach the exit door. Hearing the
      relentless grinding behind him, he throws a look over his shoulder:

      BAM! The entrance door EXPLODES in a thunderball of water.

      The Captain clambers through the exit door to:

      PASSAGEWAY #4 -

      A short hall: He shuts the entrance door, runs to the exit. He
      looks hack again:

      BAM! The door blasts open - and the torrent of water continues the
      chase, as if it's got a personal vendetta against him. He exits to:

      PASSAGEWAY #5 -

      Slamming the door behind him, the Captain looks ahead, and up:

      STAIRS. AN OPEN DOOR AT THE TOP.

      He throws a look back:

      THE ENTRANCE DOOR IS BEGINNING TO HUM AND VIBRATE.

      Sprinting for his life, the Captain rushes up the stairs, two at a
      time. The humming behind him grows louder. He glances back:

      THE DOOR BLASTS OPEN. WATER SHOOTS IN.

      He rushes up the last four steps, just as -

      CA-CHUNK! THE EXIT DOOR SLAMS CLOSED IN FRONT OF HIM!

      With PANIC IN HIS EYES, the Captain turns to face the oncoming
      tsunami! We cut to:

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY #5)

      Moving like a shark... Toward THE CAPTAIN'S LEGS, DEAD AHEAD IN THE
      WATER. As it closes in for the kill -

      THE BRIDGE -

      Shifts, suddenly, to the stern. A confusion of anxious voices:

                              HELMSMAN
                 Slipping to stern!

                              DAMAGE OFFICER
                 All major compartments flooded!

      With all hands still awaiting orders -

      THE ROOM LURCHES AS THE BOW RISES! Papers fly! Men slide! The
      First Officer has no choice:

                              FIRST OFFICER
                 Abandon ship! Break radio silence!
                 Send our position!

      INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN -

      The Communications Officer types: "Top Secret. Indian Ocean Naval
      Command. H.M.S. Indomitable Sinking."

                              COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
                       (calling out)
                 What's our position?

                              GPS OFFICER
                       (reading off his screen)
                 One hundred degrees, thirty-one
                 minutes, and seven seconds East, by
                 two degrees, twenty-nine minutes, ten
                 seconds, North.

      As he types, the room lurches again, tilting more to the stern.

      THE CAPTAIN - (STAIRCASE, PASSAGEWAY #5)

      As the passageway shifts, tilting to the stern, the Captain screams
      and WHOOSH! - is sucked down into the water - the worm's vortex -
      like meat being fed into a Cuisinart: A churning, spinning death.

      EXT. THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE - FOG - NIGHT

      Bow rises completely out of the water as the stern goes under.

      EXT. DECK -

      TWO CREWMAN manage to get a LIFEBOAT away. TWO OTHERS scramble up
      from below and leap into the water.

      WIDER

      The bow is at a forty-five degree angle... And the H.M.S.
      Indomitable pauses - for just a moment - before SLIPPING UNDER, STERN
      FIRST, throwing up a series of great waves.

      EXT. LIFEBOAT -

      Rocked by waves from the sinking ship. The Cook, a Marine, and Three
      Crewmen hear a splash along side. Two of the Crew pull the SONAR
      OFFICER aboard. He takes a minute to catch his breath, then:

                              SONAR OPERATOR
                 Six. That's it? Only six of us?

                              COOK
                 Most of the crew never made it to
                 their life jackets. The Captain?

                              SONAR OFFICER
                       (shrugs, then:)
                 The First officer stayed on the bridge.

      One of the CREWMAN SPOTS SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE:

                              CREWMAN
                 Hey - look! Over there!

      NEW ANGLE - (ROCK OUTCROPPING - STRAIT OF MALACCA - NIGHT)

      The SEA DOLPHIN II emerges from a cove, looking like a ghostly white
      apparition in the fog.

      RETURN ON THE LIFEBOAT -

      The men yell and wave and whistle, hoping to be saved.

      CLOSER ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - DECK -

      Elliot Harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face. Turns to
      YUNG, standing next to him at the rail:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it?

      Yung looks at Harmsway like he's crazy. Oblivious, Harmsway looks at
      his WATCH, then looks through the BINOCULARS again - and begins to
      WHISTLE the opening notes of My Fair Lady's "WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY."
      ("All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air")

      THE LIFEBOAT -

      As the men cry for help, the Sonar Operator spots something just
      below the surface, moving toward the lifeboat at great speed.

      He hears the hum. His eyes follow the churning water...

      And suddenly - out of nowhere - the Worm hits the lifeboat from
      below, smashing it to bits, hurtling the pieces in the air.

      THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway lowers the binoculars' smiling. Stamper appears, hands
      Harmsway a piece of paper.

                              STAMPER
                 We've decoded their last transmission.

      Harmsway studies it for a moment - smiles.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Perfect. They'll be searching miles from here.
                       (then)
                 Time for phase two. You can get the
                 men in the water.

      And with this, Harmsway turns, and walks off, jauntily whistling
      "Wouldn't It Be Loverly."

      Stamper looks at Yung, re: Harmsway's glee.

                              YUNG
                 You heard him. Get the men in the water!

      NEW ANGLE - SIDE OF THE SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT -

      INT. RESTAURANT BIBENDUM -

      A YOUNG WOMAN is yammering away at Bond; he's trying to put a good
      face on what is obviously a dreadful fix-up first date.

                              WOMAN
                 I can't believe it took us so long to
                 finally get together! What exactly
                 do you do for the government?

                              BOND
                       (after a beat)
                 You might say... 'Public relations.'

                              WOMAN
                 How fascinating! I bet you meet all
                 the most fabulous people.

      Before Bond can answer, the MAITRE D' interrupts.

                              MAITRE D'
                 Excuse me - Mr. Bond? You have a call.

      Bond excuses himself.

      NEW ANGLE - BOND AT PHONE -

      007 picks up the receiver, without saying hello:

                 Moneypenny! You're early. You
                 weren't supposed to call until -
                       (he stiffens)
                 Yes. I understand. Twenty minutes.

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT

      ADMIRAL ROEBUCK glares as MINISTER JOHNSTONE enters to address M,
      TANNER, A TREASURY OFFICIAL, and various UNIFORMS and SUITS.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 Good evening. I've just spoken with
                 the Prime Minister at the economic
                 summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a
                 full update within the hour.
                       (beat)
                 For those of you still unaware, some
                 forty minutes ago -

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                       (interrupting)
                 Excuse me, but -
                       (all turn to him:)
                 I must formally protest this meeting.
                 Given the nature of what's occurred -
                 and the need for secrecy - I see no
                 reason to involve the air force, the
                 army, or MI-6.
                       (beat, as M and Tanner exchange a look)
                 This is an internal affair that should
                 be handled strictly by the officers of
                 her Majesty's Royal Navy.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (furious)
                 Admiral, are you suggesting -

      He's distracted by the CLICK OF A DOOR OPENING. All turn to SEE BOND
      entering, wearing a FULL NAVAL UNIFORM. M stifles a smile.

                              BOND
                 Sorry I'm late -

                              M
                 Actually, you're just in time.
                       (she turns to)
                 Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander
                 Bond, don't you?

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                       (deflated)
                 Yes. Of course.

                              BOND
                 I've looked forward to meeting you.

      Bond sits. M glances at Johnstone as if to say "proceed."

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 As I was saying: Approximately forty-
                 five minutes ago, we received an abandon
                 ship signal from the H.M.S. Indomitable.
                       (flicks on a map display)
                 Looking at these infrared satellite
                 images - provided by Mr. Tanner of
                 MI-6 -the ship is presumed lost here,
                 just south of Kuala Lumpur, where she
                 broadcast her last position.

                                                                  CUT TO:

      Foreground, empty diving boat. Background, Sea Dolphin II, with the

                 Divers approaching the hull.

      Harmsway and Yung look over his shoulder at:

      INSERT - VIDEO SCREEN -

      Through the worm's UNDERWATER camera, FOUR DIVERS with TORCHES and
      WELDING TOOLS are about to enter the HOLE in the Indomitable's hull.

      (The video screen also contains lots of digital information about the
      divers and the worm's functions.)

      NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - EXT. INDOMITABLE

      The worm follows the Divers into the hull.

      WORM POV - INT. ENGINE ROOM -

      It trails the Divers past debris and bodies of crewman.

                 To the right, towards the stern.

      The Divers react, and the worm follows them into...

      PASSAGEWAY - UNDERWATER - NEUTRAL POV - INT. INDOMITABLE -

      The Divers and worm travel to a HATCH COVERED WITH METAL BARS.

      Lighting the welding torches, they try to cut through the metal
      bars... Unsuccessfully.

      VIDEO SCREEN - WORM POV -

      One of the Divers turns to the worm's camera. He SPEAKS into his
      diving helmet's microphone:

                              DIVER
                       (through speaker)
                 It's titanium. we can't cut through.

      INT. SEA DOLPHIN BRIDGE -

      Stamper turns to Harmsway:

                              STAMPER
                 I'll do it.

                              HARMSWAY (into microphone)
                 Divers, stand aside.

      NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - PASSAGEWAY -

      The worm moves into position to grind through the hatch. A protective
      cover slides over the lens, and the grinder whorls into life.

      CLOSER ON THE WORM - The grinder stalls for an instant as it
      encounters the titanium bars.

      STILL CLOSER - One of the URANIUM GRINDING TEETH SNAPS OFF as it hits
      the titanium, and starts to grind through.

      NEW ANGLE

      Once past the bars, the grinder cuts easily through the steel door.
      Trapped air bursts out from inside the compartment. The Divers push
      the worm to one side; two of them enter the hold with lights. The
      worm follows. The two other divers remain behind to feed the worm's
      flexible tubing through the door.

      INT. BILGE HOLD - UNDERWATER -

      The Divers' lights illuminate the hold: STACKS OF GOLD BARS, as far
      as the eye can see.

      INT. BRIDGE - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway looks at the video screen.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Gentlemen: I do believe we've struck
                 gold... Four minutes ahead of schedule.

      INT. BILGE HOLD - UNDERWATER -

      The worm closes its "eye", revs up its grinders, and attacks the
      first pile of gold Bars. It runs through them like butter.

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BANK OF ENGLAND - NIGHT

      The bloodletting and recriminations have begun. This plays fast:

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (incredulous)
                 One-third of the British gold reserves?!?
                       (beat)
                 What kind of idiot loses -
                       (looks to the treasury officer)
                 What is it? The equivalent of ten
                 billion US dollars???

                              TREASURY OFFICIAL
                       (sheepishly)
                 Give or take. Depending on today's
                 currency rates -

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (ignoring him)
                 What the hell was the gold doing on
                 that boat?

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 We were bringing it back from Hong
                 Kong. Under orders from the Treasury.

                              TREASURY OFFICIAL
                 During the cold war, we stored a
                 third in America, and another third
                 in Hong Kong - in case of a nuclear
                 attack. And with the turn-over of
                 Hong Kong to the Chinese -

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 Why wasn't the ship protected?!?!
                 Why was it sailing without radar?

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 I resent your tone, sir. I have men
                 who are missing -

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 And I have the entire British economy
                 to worry about.

                              BOND
                       (breaking in)
                 Minister -
                       (all turn to him)
                 Obviously, MI-6 was not involved in
                 this operation. But I have to defend
                 the Admiral.

      Roebuck looks at Bond with great surprise. Bond continues:

                              BOND (cont'd)
                 Electronic silence was the safest way
                 to move that gold. Otherwise, any
                 country - or individual - with the
                 crudest missile could just lock onto
                 our signals, and take out the boat.
                       (beat)
                 That's what happened to the Sheffield
                 in the Falklands.
                       (beat)
                 Since then, it's standard operating
                 procedure for any sensitive shipment.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                       (frowns)
                 At least we know where the gold is.
                 When are the recovery ships due?

                              ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
                 36 hours. They've already sailed
                 from the Persian gulf.

                              MINISTER JOHNSTONE
                 I expect to have that gold recovered
                 in 36 hours. Until then, I'm
                 imposing my own electronic silence:
                 For the sake of the economy, not a
                 word to NATO, the press, the CIA.
                       (beat, looking at:)
                 ...And so long as Commander Bond here
                 seems to be such an expert on these
                 matters, I want him to go along as an
                 observer. Are we agreed?

                              ROEBUCK
                 Yes.

                              BOND
                 Yes.

                              M
                 As you wish.

      EXT. SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT

      Harmsway walks along the side of the ship, observing the operation:

      The WORM'S DREDGING PUMP sucks up the ground-up GOLD AND WATER SLUR-
      RY, (through the TUBE hanging over the side,) and dumps it into a
      SERIES OF SLUICES. At each stage the gold nuggets fall to the bottom
      of the sluice, and excess water flows off the side of the ship.

      AT THE STERN HOLD -

      where all the water has been drained off, leaving a cascade of gold
      nuggets pouring into the ship's hold -

      HARMSWAY reaches into the shimmering cascade, and takes a hand-full
      of gold. He sees Stamper approaching.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Remember the golden rule, Mr.
                 Stamper: He who has the gold, rules.

      He drops the gold back in the hold.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Is the helicopter ready?

                              STAMPER
                 Fueled and waiting.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.

      INT. HALLWAY - BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT -

      M and Bond, striding down a hallway to exit the building.

                              M
                 ...You're turning into quite the
                 politician, 007.

                              BOND
                 I have an excellent teacher.
                       (sideways glance)
                 'Make sure you wear the uniform'?

                              M
                       (ignoring his jibe)
                 What do you make of all this?

                              BOND
                 It doesn't quite add up.

      They've come to a door. Pause as he opens it. He explains:

                              BOND
                 The infrared satellite images. No
                 heat, no flame, no explosion. If
                 that boat went down where they said
                 it did, there should have been some
                 residual heat reading on the surface.

                              M
                 Sabotage?

                              BOND
                 A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't
                 just vanish into thin air.

      She nods and pushes through the door. He follows.

                 I want you to find that gold, and

      They've arrived at her car. The door is already open.

                              BOND
                 ... Didn't Elliot Harmsway just move
                 his headquarters to Kuala Lumpur?

      She turns, freezes Bond with a look:

                              M
                 Contrary to what you may believe,
                 007, the world is not filled with
                 mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes,
                 stock them with big-breasted women,
                 and threaten the world with nuclear
                 annihilation.

      Bond reacts to the comeuppance. She continues:

                              M (cont'd)
                 The case is closed. The Italian
                 authorities ruled the girl a suicide.
                 We had enough trouble keeping your
                 name out of the media. For

                       (beat)
                 Your job is to find the gold. Not
                 settle some personal score with
                 Elliot Harmsway.

      EXT. 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' (HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK) - HONG KONG - DUSK

      Super: HONG KONG. Harmsway's helicopter is perched atop the famous
      tinker-toy-styled building in the Central district.

      INT. PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - DUSK

      A CHINESE CHOP comes down firmly on a legal document. GENERAL LI (of
      the People's Revolutionary Army) is seated with a squad of lawyers:

                              GENERAL LI
                 And that is the fifth document. With
                 your counter-signature, the sale will
                 be complete.

      The document is passed across to HARMSWAY, sitting with his own legal
      counsel. One of the men is WHISPERING TO HIM, INTENSELY:

                              YOUNG CHINESE LAWYER
                 Are you sure? If we waited -

      Harmsway waves the lawyer off, silencing him. Addresses the General:

                              HARMSWAY
                 General Li: My young associate here
                 has just informed me that if I waited
                 a year, I could perhaps receive a
                 higher price for this building.
                       (beat, wryly)
                 He has great faith in Hong Kong. As did
                 my ancestors. With obvious results.

      Nervous chuckles around the table, but the General is reserved.

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 Yet to sell this building for more
                 money - to profiteer - would run counter
                 to the Chinese sprit of guanchi - mutual
                 trust and obligation; it would violate
                 the ancient principles of feng shui -
                       (beat)
                 - the reason we sign five documents
                 instead of an unlucky four, and why this
                 building has a fifth, non-functioning
                 ventilation shaft on its roof.
                       (beat)
                 Wind and water, fire and rain, earth
                 and sky - feng shui. All things - at
                 one, in balance, with nature.

                              GENERAL LI
                 ...Most eloquently put, Sir Elliot.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Thank you, General Li. Now I'll just
                 sign this last document -

      He puts the pen to the paper, and BREAKS THE PEN. Alarmed looks.

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 Terribly sorry. Mr. Stamper?

      From behind, Stamper hands him a pen. Harmsway innocently starts to
      sign in RED INK -

                              GENERAL LI
                 Sir Elliot! Red ink -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Of course! How foolish. More bad
                 luck. I'll just borrow yours -

      He takes General Li's pen, and signs his name with a flourish.

      EXT. ROOF OF 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' -

      Under the whirring blades of the chopper, Harmsway bids farewell to
      General Li. He and Stamper get in helicopter.

      CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER -

      As Harmsway waves good-bye from the window, the helicopter rises,
      REVEALING a METAL CABLE attached to the LANDING SKID.

      WIDER -

      The cable leads to a spool, which runs to the FIFTH METAL VENTILATION
      SHAFT Harmsway referred to in the last scene.

      INT. HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE -

      Harmsway pops open a bottle of champagne.

                              HARMSWAY
                 An old Chinese toast to our friends...

      RETURN ON ROOFTOP HELIPAD -

      The General SEES THE CABLE GROW TAUT AROUND THE VENTILATION SHAFT.
      He reacts with horror.

      INT. HELICOPTER/HARMSWAY ROOFTOP POV -

      Harmsway glances down to watch the VENTILATION SHAFT TOPPLE onto the
      General and his aides, scattering them like rats.

      In the chopper, the pilot cuts the cable, and Harmsway lifts a
      champagne glass:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Confusion to the enemy. In 48 hours,
                 that building - and all of Hong Kong
                 around it - will cease to exist.

      AERIAL - SKIES ABOVE STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      A BRITISH MILITARY C-130 airship is dropping sono-buoys into the
      water from a low altitude. me plane veers off, revealing A BRITISH
      SEA KING command and control helicopter, hovering above.

      INT. SEA KING HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE - DAY

      Bond holds a map of the channel. He's standing over several CREWMAN
      seated at radar, sonar, and navigation consoles.

                              CREWMAN 1
                 Sounding: Bottom is thirty fathoms.

                              CREWMAN 2
                 Nothing. Negative bounce.

                              BOND
                 We should be right over it.

      They hear a SHARP DINGING SOUND -

                              OPERATOR 2
                 Wait - I'm getting something.

                              BOND
                 Where? What is it?

      The man points at one of the screens, where Bond sees a COMPUTER
      GENERATED MAP OF THE SEA FLOOR, with the FAINT OUTLINE of a WARSHIP.

                              OPERATOR 2
                 Not sure yet -

      He types in some commands on a keyboard, and a 3-D rendering of a
      boat appears on another computer screen. Lots of data:

                              OPERATOR 2
                 The Shinjuku. Japanese troop
                 carrier. World War II.

                              BOND
                 Let's make another pass.

                              CO-PILOT
                       (calling out)
                 We have traffic on the deck -

      They look down and see an HNN (Harmsway News Network) boat.

                              BOND
                 Get rid of them.

      NEW ANGLE - EXT. SEA RING CHOPPER & HNN BOAT -

      The chopper hovers above the HNN boat -

                              PILOT (on pa speaker)
                 Please leave the area. please leave
                 the area.

      EXT. HNN WORLD HEADQUARTERS (PETRONAS TOWERS)- KUALA LUMPUR - DAY

      We're looking up at the world's tallest building: The 1500' twin
      Petronas Towers. (They look like an architectural collaboration
      between Friz Lang and H.G. Wells.) At the 50th floor, there's a sky
      bridge connecting the buildings, where -

      INT. SKY BRIDGE - (HNN HEADQUARTERS) - DAY

      Elliot Harmsway strides out of an elevator (in Tower 1,) into a group
      of waiting assistants. Without breaking stride -

                              YOUNG MALE ASSISTANT 1
                 Good morning Sir Elliot! Welcome to
                 Kuala Lumpur -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Morning, morning all. What have we got?

      His EXECUTIVE SECRETARY rushes to keep up, reading from a pad, as
      they cross the sky bridge to HNN's main reception area, in Tower 2:

                              EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 The Canadian Prime Minister wants to
                 set a lunch -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Pencil it in for the next trip -

                              EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 The American presidential candidate called
                 to complain about that sex story -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution,
                 and explain I have no control over
                 what my journalists write -

                              EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 Your bankers want an answer about the
                 Brazilian TV stations

                              HARMSWAY
                 No -

                              EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 The Queen invited you to dinner -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Yes -

                              EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Excellent.

      They've passed from the bridge, through reception, into:

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - HNN HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

      A glass conference roam, whose PARTIALLY CLOSED BLINDS obscure the
      view of the MAMMOTH HNN NEWS CENTER. (We'll see this, in full,
      later.) Meanwhile, a DOZEN RAMBUNCTIOUS EDITORS react to:

                 This just came in: There's something
                 up with the British Navy in the
                 Strait. Rescue planes, helicopters;
                 two ships supposedly sailing from the
                 Persian gulf. They just chased away
                 one of our news boats.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (feigning complete innocence)
                 Is that so?

                              NEWS EDITOR 4
                 Yeah. Sounds like a plane went down
                 or something... Either way, they're
                 calling it - all together now:

                              ALL AT TABLE
                 "A routine training exercise."

                              HARMSWAY
                 I'm shocked!! Issue the usual vehement
                 protest: Freedom of the press, people's
                 right to know... Lather it up with a lot
                 of righteous indignation.

      INT. SEA KING HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE - DAY

      Frowning, Bond peers at the Sonar Operator's screen.

                              BOND
                 Still nothing?

      The operator shakes his head. The pilot calls back from the cockpit:

                              CO-PILOT
                 Commander Bond: They've found one of
                 the crewman's bodies!

      EXT. COASTAL INLET - MARSHLAND - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY

      The Sea King comes in above several police cars and boats. Bond
      jumps the last ten feet, and the chopper peels off.

                              MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                 Yo! Jimbo!

      Bond turns to look: It's JACK WADE.

                              BOND
                 Wade, what the hell are you doing here?

                              WADE
                 I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has
                 absolutely no knowledge of the
                 missing ship, the missing gold, where
                 it was going, or when it left Hong
                 Kong.

                              BOND
                 That's reassuring.

                              WADE
                 Hey - the world is my office.

                              BOND
                 Let's take a look at the body.

      As Bond moves off, WADE SNIFFS THE AIR, savoring the aroma:

                              WADE
                 Smells like... Coffee plants.

      NEW ANGLE -

      A POLICEMEN pulls a white sheet from the body. (We don't see it.)
      Bond and Wade look down at something gruesome:

                              WADE
                 Colorful... Shark attack?

      Bond shakes his head grimly.

                              BOND
                 I don't think so. The veins are
                 cauterized - as if they were sealed
                 by heat...
                       (beat, confounded)
                 But there are no burn marks on the
                 flesh. It doesn't make sense.
                       (to the policeman)
                 Who found the body?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                       (points to)
                 Dato. Local fisherman. Says it came
                 in with the tide early this morning.

                              BOND
                 Ask him if it could have washed in
                 from the west side of the Strait.

      The POLICEMAN has an animated conversation with FISHERMAN. Then:

                              POLICEMAN
                 No. He says it's not possible. The
                 current could have only brought the
                 body in from the east.

                              BOND
                       (to Wade)
                 You have a boat?

                              WADE
                 I don't know if you'd call it a boat...

                              BOND
                 Something with an engine? Not oars?

                              WADE
                 Step into my office.

      EXT. 'THE RUNNING DOG' CIGARETTE BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      Smashing through the water at breakneck speed. Wade and Bond yell
      over the engines.

                              WADE
                 What do you want with the Harbor Master?

                              BOND
                 Tide and current charts. Work
                 backward from the body - find where
                 the ship sank.
                       (Wade nods appreciatively)
                 Where did you get the boat?

                              WADE
                 Seized it from a guy smuggling
                 computer chips out of Bangkok.
                       (beat)
                 Should have seen his rose garden:
                 Blooms the size of hand grenades.

      Bond looks at Wade: The man remains, forever deranged.

      EXT. PORT KLANG - ESTABLISHING - DAY

      The Harbor Master's tower overlooks a small armada of yachts, fishing
      boats, etc. A series of long dockways jut out into the harbor.

      CIGARETTE BOAT - (PORT KLANG - WATERWAY) - DAY

      Wade's boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the
      docks. Looking off, Bond spots the Harbor Master's Tower:

                              BOND
                 Over there.

      Wade turns the boat down one of the dock channels.

      NEW ANGLE - WADE/BOND'S POV - DOCKWAY CHANNEL -

      A SLEEK LAUNCH is ROARING TOWARDS them, on a dead collision course.
      A WOMAN in a baseball cap is at the wheel.

      WADE pulls his boat to the right; the LAUNCH ROARS AROUND THEM,
      rocking the cigarette boat with its wake.

      BOTH BOND and WADE clock the woman - who we will later learn is
      SIDNEY WINCH. Wade stares after her:

                              WADE
                 I think I've just seen my next future
                 ex-wife.

                              BOND
                       (seeing they're about to crash)
                 Not if you kill us first - unless
                 that's how you plan to leave Muffy.

      Wade scowls, setting the boat back on course.

      DOCKSIDE - PORT KLANG - DAY -

      Bond hops off the boat, securing the lines. Wade joins him.

                              WADE
                 By the way, Jimbo - whatever happened
                 to that girl - in Cuba - ?

      Finished tying the boat, they walk toward the Harbor Master's office.

                              BOND
                 Natalya?

                              WADE
                 Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.

                              BOND
                 She married a hockey player.

                              WADE
                 I envy your 'undercover' assignments.

                              BOND
                       (a look, then)
                 We work in the dark. We do what we can.

      INT. HARBOR MASTER OFFICE - PORT KLANG - DAY

      The local Malay harbor master puts a stack of charts on the counter.

                              HARBOR MASTER
                 Wind, tide, currents... You're the
                 second person today asked for a full
                 set of charts.
                       (holds out a clipboard)
                 If you'd just sign here -

      Bond takes the clipboard -

      INSERT CLIPBOARD - read signature: SIDNEY WINCH.

      Bond returns the clipboard:

                              BOND
                 Thanks.
                       (apparent afterthought)
                 By the way - was there anything
                 strange the night before last? Odd
                 weather, lost boats - ??

                              HARBOR MASTER
                 No... Unless you're talking about
                 the bus problem.

                              BOND
                 ...Bus problem?

                              HARBOR MASTER
                 Captain Cheong's ferry was late. He
                 runs the line across the Strait
                 between here and Sumatra. The lumber
                 mill workers coming back for the
                 weekend missed the last bus. Slept
                 on the docks. Hundreds of them.

                              BOND
                 Thanks.

      EXT. HARBOR MASTER'S TOWER - DAY

      Bond emerges, carrying the charts, along with Wade.

                              BOND
                 I have to get these to London. Do
                 you know this Captain Cheong?

                              WADE
                 Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur
                 yacht club.

                              BOND
                 Can you arrange a meeting?

                              WADE
                 Hell. The CIA built that club.

      EXT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

      Palm trees, torch lights, and Rolls Royces.

      INT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

      A local band plays on the verandah. We find Wade at a POKER TABLE
      with five local Malay Chinese. He CUTS THE CARDS, exuberantly:

                              WADE
                 Okay gentlemen. The name of the game
                 is 7-card Cambodian stud. Everything
                 is wild!

      And then - moving through a beaded glass curtain - we find Bond, in a
      white dinner jacket, sitting with CAPTAIN CHEONG. The Captain is
      elegant, mid-5O's, eye patch. (To be put into local dialect.)

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat
                 is even five minutes late, one begins
                 to worry, Mr. Bond.

                              BOND
                 I know. Pirates from Sumatra want
                 the cargo; smugglers from Thailand
                 and Burma want the ships.

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 Sometimes kill the crew; other times -
                       (points to his eye)
                 Torture them.

                              BOND
                 I'm sorry.

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles
                 off-course that night. Captain blamed
                 the auto-pilot; I suspected he was
                 drunk - until the Sumatra ferry
                 captain had same problem.

                              BOND
                 Did you test the auto-pilots? The
                 satellite positioning receiver?

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.
                       (chuckles)
                 My 90 year old grandfather thinks
                 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon
                 Dragon.'

                              BOND
                       (smiles, standing to leave)
                 I appreciate your time -

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch.
                 Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody
                 knows more about the Strait.

                              BOND
                 Where can I find him?

                              CAPTAIN CHEONG
                 Him? He, is a she -
                       (points)
                 at the bar.

      NEW ANGLE - THE BAR -

      SIDNEY WINCH, about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,)
      beautiful, is ordering a drink when Bond appears:

                              SIDNEY
                 Bourbon. Neat.

                              BOND
                 I wonder if you handle your liquor
                 more carefully than you handle your boat.

      Very slowly, Sidney turns to Bond. She looks him up and down - as if
      deciding whether this specimen is worth her time. Her conclusion: A
      definite - though skeptical - maybe. She gives him a sultry smile:

                              SIDNEY
                 Sometimes, you just have to plunge
                 into things. Be reckless.

                              BOND
                 - And I bet you always leave turmoil
                 in your wake.

                              SIDNEY
                       (thinking, 'not bad')
                 Have we met?

                              BOND
                 This afternoon. Our boats practically
                 kissed in the harbor.
                       (holds out his hand to shake)
                 James Bond.

                              SIDNEY
                 Sidney Winch.

      The BARTENDER APPEARS.

                              BOND
                 Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.
                       (to Sidney)
                 And another for you?

                              SIDNEY
                 No. But you can buy a drink for my
                 friend, Taro.

      She steps back REVEALING a huge SAMOAN, TARO, wearing a dark suit and
      tie, sitting on a stool. Taro smiles menacingly at Bond.

                              BOND
                 Boyfriend?

                              SIDNEY
                 Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.

                              BOND
                 Pity.
                       (to Bartender)
                 Bring him whatever he wants.

                              SIDNEY
                 So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur,
                 Mr. Bond?
                       (beat)
                 Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage?
                 Running from some poor little girl
                 with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in -
                 London?

      Bond analyzes the situation: 1) She's with a thug. 2) She's in marine
      salvage. 3) She went to the Harbor Master's office for the charts.
      4) She's a smart-ass. He decides to see if he can rattle her:

                              BOND
                 Actually, I'm here on business. You
                 might say it was a... Golden opportunity.

                              SIDNEY
                       (a chill in her voice)
                 And exactly what business are you in,
                 Mr. Bond?

                              BOND
                 Insurance. Lloyds of London.

                              SIDNEY
                       (daggers in her voice)
                 The Strait can be a very dangerous
                 place, Mr. Bond. A few words
                 scribbled on a piece of paper in
                 London doesn't carry a lot of value
                 out here. Including life insurance.

                              BOND
                 I'll keep that in mind.

                              SIDNEY
                       (looking off)
                 I see my date is here.
                       (to Taro)
                 And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.

                              BOND
                 Nice to run into you again.

                              SIDNEY
                 Let's not make it a habit.

      She exits. Turning his back on Taro, Bond watches her cross the
      room. Taro places a huge hand on Bond's shoulder -

                              TARO
                 I think you should go -

                              BOND
                 Not quite yet, Taro -

      And from BOND'S POV - Sidney greets HARMSWAY with a big hug.

                              SIDNEY
                 Uncle Elliot!!

      Watching this, Bond seethes with memory of Paris and his hatred of
      Harmsway. Taro tightens his grip -

                              TARO
                 I said you should -

      But before he finishes, Bond spins, and: 1) slams Taro's head on the
      bar, 2) snatches the ice-pick from the bartender, 3) yanks Taro back-
      ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice-pick through Taro's tie into the
      wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon.

      Taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking.

      Bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow-tie. Wade appears,
      jubilant, with a wad of cash:

                              WADE
                 Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -
                       (seeing Taro)
                 What happened?

                              BOND
                 He tied one on.

      EXT. A DESERTED MARINA - MORNING -

      Bond walks down a long dock towards a lone boat, moored at the end.

      EXT./INT. BOAT AT MARINA - MORNING -

      Bond looks around furtively, before climbing aboard the sleek ocean-
      going craft. On the aft-deck, there's a large covered object.

      As Bond reaches for the CABIN DOOR, it opens by itself - and a
      succession of THREE YOUNG ENGLISH WOMEN in STRING BIKINIS emerge.

                              GIRL ONE
                 Good morning!

                              GIRL TWO
                 Good morning.

                              GIRL THREE
                       (calling back into the cabin)
                 He's arrived.

      Bond turns from the door to watch the women. He hears:

                              Q'S VOICE
                 You're late 007. I've been expecting
                 you.

      Q emerges from the cabin in a blazer and an ascot. He's irritated:

                              BOND
                 Q! How are you?

                              Q
                 Retired. I'm not getting paid to
                 help you save the world anymore.

                              BOND
                 I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -

                              Q
                 That hardly makes up for the imposition.
                       (beat)
                 Now, for what I hope will be the very
                 last time - pay attention, 007.
                       (he unfurls a map:)
                 First, computer generated retrograde
                 analysis map. Body here, meteorolog-
                 ical influences here, likely vector-
                 ing of the ship's coordinates here.

                              BOND
                 Do you have any idea of what any of
                 that means? In English?

                              Q
                 Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.
                       (reaches for a Filofax sized device)
                 Next, your new personal communicator.
                       (flips it open)
                 Picture-phone, fax, beeper.

                              BOND
                       (taking it)
                 Do I have to dial '9' to get out?

                              Q
                 I don't care who you dial, so long as
                 it's not me. Next -

      Q walks to the large object on the aft-deck. Pulls off a tarp:

                              Q
                 Your new car. (Insert name)

                              BOND
                       (interrupting)
                 - Four wheel drive?

                              Q
                 Yes. And do try to keep all four of
                 them on the road.
                       (continuing)
                 All the usual refinements: Smoke,
                 missiles, machine guns -
                       (shows him a key fob)
                 Fully operational remote control.
                 Drives forward, reverse -
                       (Bond presses a button,
                        opening a window)
                 Stop that!
                       (grabbing it away)
                 Plus infrared thermal imaging radar,
                 heads up instrumentation, and 17
                 beverage cup holders.

                              BOND
                 ... 17 Beverage cup holders?

                              Q
                 Standard equipment. The world's
                 automobile manufacturers seem to be
                 in some kind of mad war to see who
                 can provide the most beverage cup
                 holders.

      Bond nods, and LOOKS AT a distraction from the GIRLS IN BIKINIS.

                              BOND
                 I must say, Q, you seem to be doing
                 rather well in your retirement.

                              Q
                 Don't even think about it. 007.
                 They're my granddaughters.

      STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      Clear skies and blue water. The only vessel in sight is a thirty-
      five foot SPORT FISHING BOAT underway at full throttle.

      EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT, FLYING BRIDGE - DAY -

      Wade at the helm; Bond next to him, near sonar, holding Q's map.

                              BOND
                 Slow down. We're close.

      Wade pulls back on the throttle.

      AERIAL - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/STRAIT OF MALACCA) - DAY -

      The boat starts a wide turn -

      NEW ANGLE - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/ROCK OUTCROPPING/STRAIT) - DAY -

      And we're back at the outcropping where the Indomitable sank. The
      SPORT FISHING BOAT is trolling against a background of sandy beaches
      and the lush green hills of Sumatra.

      FLYING BRIDGE -

      Wade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display.

                              WADE
                 I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out
                 here. How could they get this far
                 off course?

                              BOND
                       (concentrating on the sonar)
                 Who knows? Fog, night...

                              WADE
                 They'd never sail this close to the shore.

                              BOND
                 Wait a minute -
                       (beat, pointing to the
                        screen)
                 I've got it. There! Off the port bow!

      INSERT SONAR SCREEN -

      The murky electronic outline of a ship.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Bond watches the sonar screen. Wade slows engines, consults charts.

                              BOND
                 Cut the engines! It's about two-
                 hundred fifty feet down.

                                                              JUMP CUT TO:

      AN ANCHOR BEING PITCHED INTO THE WATER - (BOW OF SPORT FISHING BOAT) -

      By Wade. Bond is strapping on his scuba tank.

                              WADE
                 Two-fifty's pretty deep for air. You
                 should really be using mixed gases.

      Bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks.

                              BOND
                 I'll make a bounce dive. If I can
                 keep my bottom time short, I'll be
                 all right.

      Bond gathers up FLARES, and sits on the gunwale.

                              BOND
                       (only half teasing)
                 Keep your eye out for pirates.

      Wade pulls back his shirt to reveal TWO SIX-SHOOTERS.

                              WADE
                 I got you covered.

                              BOND
                 That's reassuring.

      Bond rolls backward into the water and disappears.

      UNDERWATER -

      Bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward,
      handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom.

      UNDERWATER BOTTOM -

      Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom.
      Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel.

      EXT. INDOMITABLE - UNDERWATER -

      Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand.

      Bond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color.
      From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being
      lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge.

      INSERT GAUGES -

      Depth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to
      study the damage. Then enters.

      INT. ENGINE ROOM - UNDERWATER -

      Bond sees the damage on the passageway door. Swims through it.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY - UNDER WATER -

      The flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the
      busted bilge-hold hatch. Again, he pauses to examine the marks made
      by the worm. He drops into the hold.

      INT. CARGO HOLD - UNDER WATER -

      The gold is gone. Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing. A vast empty
      space. Bond's flare sputters and dies. He drops it, lights another.

      As he turns to exit, SOMETHING GLINTS on the deck below the hatch.
      He moves toward it.

      NEW ANGLE - CLOSER -

      A half-chewed GOLD BAR is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead.
      Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold.

      Just as he yanks the bar out, a MORAY EEL lashes out from behind the
      brace, baring its teeth.

      Still clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into:

      PASSAGE WAY -(INT. INDOMITABLE) - UNDER WATER -

      where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling.
      Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see:

      THE FACE OF A FLOATING DEAD SAILOR.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Throwing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll-
      ing under some debris. Regaining his composure, Bond SLIPS THE GOLD
      BAR INTO A WEBBED SACK ON HIS BELT, then moves to retrieve the flare.

      CLOSE ON HATCH/DECK -

      Bond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover.
      He notices the BROKEN URANIUM GRINDING TOOTH. He picks it up, stuffs
      it into his sack, and swims off.

                                                                   CUT TO:

      UNDERWATER BOTTOM - ANCHOR -

      Bond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up. On the
      way, he glances at his gauges:

      INSERT GAUGES -

      Depth: 160 feet - Air capacity: below RED LINE - empty. The ambient
      light level on the gauges suddenly DARKENS.

      BOND LOOKS UP TO THE SURFACE -

      HIS POV -

      A black HULL has blotted out the light... And SOMETHING LARGE AND
      HEAVY IS FALLING straight at 007.

      BOND -

      kicks away from the anchor-line just as a 1000 POUND ANCHOR streaks
      by. He looks up again:

      THREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER.

      One carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a
      CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007.

      BOND -

      Realizes his best chance is to take one of the men hostage.

      Flashing his KNIFE, Bond cuts the cord to his gold/uranium sack,
      STUFFS THE SACK INTO HIS BAGGY SWIM TRUNKS.

      Bond rockets up, SLAMMING INTO DIVER #1. A confusion of bubbles.

      And just as Bond overcomes the man - spinning him around, holding the
      knife to the diver's throat -

      DIVER #2 SHOOTS the HARPOON-TYPE GUN, and A DOLPHIN NET explodes out,
      ENVELOPING BOND AND THE DIVER in a mesh. (Note: This is a real,
      'fish friendly' research tool.)

      Diver #3 HOOKS THE CABLE he's been trailing onto the net, and -

      EXT. SEA -

      The net erupts through the surface, is hauled up into the air, and
      deposited on -

      THE DECK OF A SELF-PROPELLED SALVAGE BARGE.

      (An old scow, with a large crane, two-story deck-house, and a crew
      whose idea of 'cruise-wear' runs to tattoos and grotesque scars.

      BOND'S POV - THROUGH HIS DIVING MASK -

      As the water drains from his mask, Bond sees the mesh being pulled
      away, and FIVE GOONS come into focus, training AUTOMATIC WEAPONS on
      him. (Bond still has the diver from behind, knife to his throat.)

      One of the goons reaches forward, ripping off Bond's mask. 007 sees:

      TARO - (EXT. SALVAGE BARGE, DECK) -

      Brandishing an UZI at Bond, with a malevolent smile:

                              TARO
                 Uzi beats knife.

                              BOND
                 ...Interesting point.

      Bond sticks the knife into the deck, and releases the hostage.

                              TARO
                 Get him up. Take his belt.
                       (motioning to Wade)
                 Take the two of them to the Captain.

      The men grab Bond roughly, and shove him next to Wade.

                              TARO
                 By the way. I almost forgot.
                       (smashing Bond)
                 I owed you one.

      Bond and Wade are frog-marched to the bridge, passing under the gaze
      of various cutthroat crew members. Wade is completely unfazed.

                              WADE
                       (sniffs the air)
                 Smell that Jimmy? Sea Kelp.

      Bond gives Wade a look.

                              WADE
                 Hey - it could be worse. At least
                 they speak English.

      Bond glances up at a crew member, SHARPENING A MACHETE, smiling.

                              BOND
                 ...Somehow, that's not reassuring.

      INT. BRIDGE - SALVAGE BARGE - DAY

      We're back in Bond-land: A high-tech control room, with lots of
      monitors and white-suited TECHNICIANS. Bond and Wade are pushed
      through the-door, followed by Taro and the two goons.

                              TARO
                 Here they are, Captain.

      The "Captain" turns from a monitor: IT'S SIDNEY.

                              SIDNEY
                 Just give me one goad reason - Mister
                 Bond, from Lloyds of London - why I
                 shouldn't kill both of you, burn your
                 boat, and use your bodies for shark bait.

                              WADE
                       (chirping up)
                 So you two know each other!?! Small
                 world, ain't it? What happened?
                 Commitment problems?

                              SIDNEY
                 Who is he?

                              BOND
                 Sidney Winch, meet -

                              WADE
                 Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial
                 loan division. If you're ever lookin'
                 for a sweet refinance on the boat -

                              SIDNEY
                 - Shut up!

                              BOND
                       (to Wade)
                 You have to excuse Miss Winch: She
                 thinks she's on a 'seduce and
                 destroy' mission through life...
                       (pauses)
                 ...But she won't kill us.

                              SIDNEY
                 No?

                              BOND
                 No. First, because I don't think
                 it's in your nature. And second,
                 because there's no gold down there.

                              SIDNEY
                 So charming! So suave!
                       (beat)
                 Don't insult me. I'm not one of your
                 'little London girls' who falls for
                 the lies.

                              WADE
                 So it was commitment!

                              SIDNEY
                 Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong
                 knows what's on that boat and I'm
                 claiming it. One-third of that gold is
                 mine.

                              BOND
                 That's fine, but - even a little
                 London girl knows that one third of
                 nothing is still nothing.

      There's a flicker of doubt in her eyes. She turns to Taro:

                              SIDNEY
                 Was he carrying anything?

      Taro holds up the BOND'S DIVING BELT, indicating 'nothing'. Angrily:

                              SIDNEY
                 Search him.

      The men look at Bond - wearing only swim trunks. Nobody moves.

                              SIDNEY
                 Do I have to do everything around here?

                              BOND
                 I hope so.

      Frowning, Sidney moves to Bond. As she REACHES INTO HIS TRUNKS, we
      cut to THEIR FACES. THEIR EYES ARE LOCKED ON EACH OTHER:

                              BOND
                 I hope you'll be gentle.

                              SIDNEY
                 Think about mom.

      BOND WINCES. She's goosed him.

                              BOND
                 ... Unusual technique.

      Returning to the WIDE SHOT, she opens the sack. SHOWS THE GOLD:

                              SIDNEY
                 And what do you call this?

                              BOND
                 - The family jewels?

      She scowls, takes out the URANIUM TOOTH. Looks at it, blankly, and
      holds it out to a TECHNICIAN, who examines it.

                              SIDNEY
                 What is this?

                              TECHNICIAN
                 ...I don't know. I'm not sure -

      Just then, a CREWMAN BURSTS IN:

                              CREWMAN
                 Boss! We got company - comin' up off
                 the starboard bow!

                              SIDNEY
                       (exiting, to Taro)
                 Bring them.

      Taro motions with his Uzi for Bond and Wade to follow...

      But BOND hesitates, LOOKING BACK AT THE TECHNICIAN with the URANIUM.
      007 wants to get it, but Taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle.

      EXT. MALACCA STRAIT - DAY

      A BRITISH NAVAL CUTTER is pulling alongside the barge - SEA SIREN
      WAILING, crew members in battle gear, FORWARD GATLING GUN manned.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (on bullhorn)
                 Attention sea barge: Lay down your
                 weapons, and prepare to be boarded.

      ON THE BARGE - Sidney and Co. stand, weapons ready.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and
                 prepare to be boarded.

      Bond turns to Sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own.

                              BOND
                 If I were you -

                              SIDNEY
                 - You're not.

                              BOND
                       (as she hoists the bullhorn)
                 Just remember: They think there's ten
                 billion dollars in gold down there.

                              SIDNEY
                 Thank you.
                       (clicks it on, and:)
                 "Now hear this: Drop dead."

      Bond and Wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both
      know what's coming next. There's a pause, then -

      THE CRUISER'S GATLING GUN ERUPTS WITH AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING SALVO.
      It's only a warning shot, but -

      EVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK... Except for Bond and
      Wade, who might as well be having tea. Bond looks down at Taro,
      cowering on the boards.

                              BOND
                 Gatling gun beats Uzi.

      NEW ANGLE - (CUTTER/BARGE) - DAY

      An ARMED BOARDING PARTY is coming across an aluminum bridge that has
      extended from the Cutter onto the barge.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (a tiny popinjay)
                 Who's in charge here?

                              SIDNEY
                 I am. What do you want?

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 You have precisely one minute to pull
                 up your anchor and be under way.

                              SIDNEY
                 Forget it. No way. I got here first.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (ignoring her)
                 Who's Wade?

                              WADE
                 That would be me -

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (snidely)
                 Thanks for your message.
                       (turns to)
                 And you're Bond?

                              BOND
                 Yes -

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Guard! Arrest these men! Escort
                 them to the cutter!

      Bond and Wade are stunned. The Marines move in. Bond struggles -

                              BOND
                 Wait a minute -

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Get them out of here. If he says one
                 word, shoot him.

      As TWO MARINES with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across the
      folding bridge -

                              SIDNEY
                       (demanding)
                 What's your name?

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Captain Morton.

      Pause. She expects him to ask "And yours?" but he doesn't.

                              SIDNEY
                 My name is Sidney Winch, and -

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Good for you, Miss Winch. You now
                 have exactly 30 seconds to get this
                 rust bucket out of here.

                              SIDNEY
                       (furiously)
                 I know my rights. These are
                 international waters. The British
                 Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm
                 claiming it. Under international
                 law, I have the right to salvage
                 what's on that wreck.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should
                 consider hiring an attorney.

                              SIDNEY
                 I was an attorney!

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above
                 that profession.
                       (beat)
                 Ten seconds. Are you leaving?

                              SIDNEY
                 No.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 You leave me no alternative.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (upholstering a walkie-talkie)
                 Cut her anchor.

      As Sidney yells "NO!" - THE FORWARD GATLING GUN erupts to life. One
      short, bone rattling burst CUTS THE CHAIN.

                              SIDNEY
                 You won't get away with this!

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (stepping onto the bridge)
                 Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you
                 to get some steam up - before you run
                 aground.

      As she floats away, Sidney calls out to the Captain, Bond and Wade:

                              SIDNEY
                 You bastards! Believe me - you
                 haven't heard the last of me!

      EXT. DECK - THE CUTTER - DAY -

      Bond, Wade and the Captain.

                              WADE
                 - Nice trick with the arrest. Very convincing.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 It's no trick, Mr. Wade. I've got
                 half a mind to throw both of you in
                 the brig.

                              BOND
                 Don't you think you're overreacting?

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                       (with great sarcasm)
                 Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard
                 all about you, sir. You were under
                 direct orders to act as an observer -
                 and yet you had to go off, on your own,
                 like some half-assed CIA cowboy -
                       (Wade reacts)
                 Endangering the gold, attracting that
                 lunatic woman, and then putting in a
                 distress call for us to save your
                 bloody hide.

                              BOND
                       (Calmly)
                 ...That's all well and good, Captain,
                 save for one thing:
                       (beat)
                 There's no gold down there.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 What are you talking about? We went
                 through all this and the ship isn't
                 even down there?

                              BOND
                 Yes, the ship is down there. But the
                 gold is gone.

                              CAPTAIN MORTON
                 That's absurd! It took two squads of
                 forty men fifteen days to load that
                 gold.

                              BOND
                 I know what I saw -

                              CAPTAIN
                 I don't care what you think you saw.
                 You're a damned amateur.
                       (beat)
                 Just get off my ship. Go back to
                 your trench-coats and your code names
                 - and leave the job to professionals.

                              BOND
                       (exchanges a glance with Wade, then)
                 Aye-aye, Captain.

      EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      As Bond and Wade push away from the Naval Cutter:

                              WADE
                 Where to now, Jimbo?

                              BOND
                       (thinking)
                 I'm not certain... But I think
                 there's someone I want to press for
                 some answers in Kuala Lumpur.

      EXT. COASTAL ROADWAY - MALAYSIA - (BOND CAR) - DAY -

      Bond'- car travels through the tropical landscape, turning at a sign
      for Kuala Lumpur.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - COASTAL ROADWAY - DAY -

      As Bond downshifts in anticipation of an upcoming hill, his CAR PHONE
      RINGS. Before answering it, he looks down at:

      INSERT - DASHBOARD - DIGITAL DISPLAY PANEL -

      Displayed on separate lines:, "INCOMING CALL." "ORIGIN: (the display
      runs through numbers until it hits on) 763-4733." "NAME: (blinking)
      UNKNOWN. "STATUS: (blinking) SECURE."

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Reacting - the information is curious. Bond picks up the phone.

                              BOND
                 Bond.

                              HARMSWAY'S VOICE
                 Hello, Mister Bond.

                              BOND
                       (with an edge)
                 Who is this?

      INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -

      Harmsway is perched on a desk. In the background, THROUGH HIS OPEN
      OFFICE DOOR, we can see Harmsway's EXECUTIVE SECRETARY serving
      someone coffee from a SILVER TRAY - but we can't see who it is.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Elliot Harmsway! I heard you were in
                 K.L. and thought we might get
                 together for a chat...

      RETURN ON BOND - (INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING) -

                              HARMSWAY (Cont'd, O.S.)
                 We seemed to get off on the wrong
                 foot back there in Venice.

                              BOND
                 How did you get this number?

      INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the
                 information age! Information is
                 currency - and with the right currency,
                 you can have any piece of information.
                       (Bond reacts, sourly)
                 Besides I own the phone company. What
                 do you say? Twenty minutes?

                              BOND
                 I'm on my way.

      Bond hangs up, and drives with renewed determination.

      INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -

      Harmsway hangs up; STAMPER is standing nearby. Harmsway throws a
      concerned glance at his office, then turns to Stamper:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Let's find out exactly what he knows.

      EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - ROADWAY -(BOND CAR) - LATE AFTERNOON -

      Bond's car approaches the camera, passes it, and heads for HARMSWAY
      TOWERS, looming over Kuala Lumpur in the distance.

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - STREET LEVEL - LATE AFTERNOON -

      Bond's car passes the front of the building, and drives down a ramp
      into an underground car park.

      INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - (HARMSWAY TOWERS) -

      Passing NEWSPAPER LOADING DOCKS (with trucks displaying both the
      "TOMORROW" and "HNN" logos, and HUM-VEES used by building security,)
      Bond pulls into the VALET AREA -

      Where a cheerful YOUNG PR WOMAN and VALET wait. Both wear the
      colorful BLAZER used by all Harmsway Building service personnel.

                              BOND
                       (from inside the car)
                 James Bond to see Elliot Harmsway.

                              PR WOMAN
                 Yes. I'm to bring you right up. The
                 valet will take your car -

                              BOND
                 I'd prefer to park it myself.
                       (off her questioning look)
                 Temperamental. Practically has a
                 mind of its own.

                              PR WOMAN
                 Don't they all?

      She points to a spot near the loading docks. Bond drives off.

      INT. BOND'S CAR -

      Bond backs into the space, thinking about the (inevitable) quick get-
      away. He looks through the windshield, surveying the area.

      BOND'S POV - UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -

      TWO BURLY SECURITY GUARDS (in Harmsway Blazers,) stand behind a
      bulletproof security desk. There's a METAL DETECTOR by the door.

      BACK TO SCENE (INT. BOND'S CAR) -

      Reaching inside his jacket, Bond REMOVES HIS GUN, and HIDES IT in a
      compartment under the dashboard.

      INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -

      The PR WOMAN joins Bond as he locks the car with the REMOTE CONTROL.

                              PR WOMAN
                 Right this way.

      Following her through the metal detector, Bond scans the security
      devices at the guard's desk: Lots of cameras, sensors, and alarms.

      EXT. PRESSROOM OBSERVATION ARCADE -

      Bond and the PR Woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with
      GLASS WINDOWS looking down into a mammoth NEWSPAPER PRINTING PLANT.

                              PR WOMAN
                       (moving to a door)
                 Mr. Harmsway is checking the afternoon
                 editions. If you'll just follow me -

      INT. PRESSROOM BALCONY -

      The NOISE FROM THE PRINTING PRESSES is deafening. Bond and the PR
      WOMAN walk down a METAL STAIRCASE to the pressroom floor, where -

      Harmsway (wearing a printer's smock and newsprint cap,) is joking
      with SEVERAL PRESSMEN - a fresh issue of "Tomorrow" outstretched in
      his hands.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (spotting Bond, yelling:)
                 Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.

                              BOND
                 Sir Elliot.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Come. Let's get out of the noise.
                       (escorting Bond off)
                 - I'll give you a tour of the
                 building, then we'll talk.

      INT. DRESSING ALCOVE - OFF THE PRESSROOM -

      Harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from
      the press room to an elevator. There's a SINK in the room.

                              HARMSWAY
                 It's funny, Mr. Bond. Of all the
                 things I own, nothing gives me as
                 much enjoyment as my newspapers.

      He moves to the sink to wash his hands. Turns on the faucets:

                              HARMSWAY (cont'd)
                 Ironic, isn't it? In the age of TV, I
                 still can't get the ink out of my veins.

      Bond SMILES WRYLY, looking at Harmsway hunched over the sink:

                              BOND
                 Yes... A man with ink in his veins,
                 and blood on his hands.

      Harmsway smiles to himself, acknowledging the jibe... But decides to
      ignore it. He turns off the faucet, dries his hands -

                              HARMSWAY
                 We print 31 newspapers here; another
                 two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite
                 plants around the world.

      He pulls on his £2000 Saville Row suit-jacket.

                              BOND
                 ... And how many of those newspapers
                 carried Paris Harmsway's obituary?

      Harmsway turns, and presses the ELEVATOR BUTTON. The doors open,
      instantly. HE SMILES:

                              HARMSWAY
                 All of them, Mister Bond...
                       (motioning inside)
                 After you?

      INT. ELEVATOR -

      The doors close. Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling.
      Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Before I became involved with Paris,
                 she was always involved with the most
                 inappropriate' men...
                       (beat)
                 Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle
                 aged Peter Pans who only brought out
                 the worst in her.

                              BOND
                 I see.

                              HARMSWAY
                 I tried to save her. But she remained a
                 manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate
                 behavior... Delusions of grandeur.

                              BOND
                 I wonder if it runs in the family.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (bursts out in a laugh)
                 The only difference between a
                 psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is
                 the degree of success.

      He looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Still, I do miss her. I only wish
                 she could have lived to see all this.

                              BOND
                 I can feel your pain.

      The doors open:

                              HARMSWAY
                 By the way - what is it that brings
                 you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?

                              BOND
                 Sightseeing.

      Harmsway motions for Bond to exit. They step out into:

      INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY ("ROGUES GALLERY") - LATE AFTERNOON

      A short hallway lined with OIL PORTRAITS of Harmsway's ancestors.
      Double doors at both ends. (People passing through.) As they walk -

                              HARMSWAY
                 I call this the Rogue's gallery.

                              BOND
                 Yes. I can see: You've hung the
                 rest of your relatives.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (pointing to the first portrait)
                 My third great Uncle - the Earl of
                 Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of
                 Hong Kong from the Chinese.
                       (moving to)
                 His son-in-law - George Harmsway -
                 made the first family fortune,
                 running opium into Shanghai...
                       (moving to)
                 His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking
                 the opium...
                 And my grandfather Henry, who opened the
                 first telegraph station, and published
                 the colony's first English newspaper.
                       (pausing, wistfully)
                 It was a city of unlimited possibility.

                              BOND
                 So why did you leave?

                              HARMSWAY
                 Because it's a dying city. Since the
                 Chinese take-over, who knows what can
                 happen tomorrow?
                       (moving to the last two portraits)
                 In any case, this is my father, Charles: A
                 royal bastard who started the first radio
                 and television stations. Said I'd never
                 amount to anything, but...
                       (passing his own portrait)
                 I turned it into this

      He pushes through a door, into:

      INT. HNN NEWS CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON -

      A cavernous THREE STORY ROOM bristling with activity. At the center
      is the main HNN ANCHOR DESK, (where a news broadcast is in progress,)
      surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la CNN.

      Around the perimeter of the room are VARIOUS TV STUDIOS looking out
      on Kuala Lumpur. All are broadcasting: A Larry King-type chat show;
      MTV; SPORTS; a KITCHEN where a chef is preparing something flambeed.

      With its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect
      is overwhelming. Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.
                       (starting to walk)
                 Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his
                 legions; I have my divisions:
                       (pointing)
                 News, sports, business, entertainment.
                 And these are my foot soldiers:
                       (a wave of his hand)
                 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed
                 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87
                 magazines, and 29 different cable TV
                 channels - in 35 languages.

                              BOND
                 And still not a thing to watch.

      He glances at the SATELLITE CONTROL ROOM, with a NASA-type WORLD MAP.

                              BOND
                 ...Although it must be fun to have
                 all those satellites.

                              HARMSWAY
                 They're merely tools to disseminate
                 information.

                              BOND
                       (wryly)
                 Or disinformation... If you wanted to,
                 say, beam down a signal to send a ship
                 off course? Maybe one degree a minute?

                              HARMSWAY
                       (guffaws)
                 Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I
                 should buy it for a book! It's
                 totally preposterous, but -
                       (off Bond's reaction)
                 You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I
                 can amuse you.

      He stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL. Begins to type.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Let's see... First we have this
                 James Bond... I believe he's a field
                 adjuster for Lloyd's of London...

      INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S MI-6 COVER -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Then we have this James Bond.

      INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S KGB FILE -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (reading from the screen)
                 ... Licensed to Kill...
                       (aside)
                 Not a bad title for that book...
                       (then)
                 Or perhaps you'd prefer this James Bond -

      INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S CHINESE FILE -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Who I believe they call "007."

      Bond is not amused. Harmsway is enjoying himself:

                              HARMSWAY
                 You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both
                 men of action. But your era is passing.
                 Words are the new weapons; satellites the
                 new artillery. And make no mistake about
                 it: In the right hands, they can be as
                 deadly as your Walther PPK.

                              BOND
                 ...Words to live by?

                              HARMSWAY
                 Your choice.
                       (glancing at his watch)
                 Look at the time! Come. There's
                 someone I want you meet - about a
                 story I'm thinking of publishing.

      As they leave, Bond is frustrated by Harmsway's "I don't care what
      you think you know - I can crush you" attitude... And now, Harmsway
      plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use Bond, to tie off
      the one other loose thread in his perfect crime:

      INT. HARMSWAY'S OFFICE -

      The DOOR opens and Harmsway enters, followed by Bond. He calls to
      someone we don't see:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Hello, dear. I'm sorry I took so long -

      REVEAL: SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk.

                              SIDNEY
                 That's okay, Uncle Ell -

      She freezes in mid-sentence, seeing Bond. Bond is equally surprised.

                              SIDNEY
                 What is HE doing here?

                              HARMSWAY
                 I see you two have met.

                              BOND
                 Briefly.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (crossing to his desk)
                 Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him
                 here hoping he might shed some light
                 on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of
                 London.'
                       (sly glance to Bond)
                 ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?

                              SIDNEY
                 He's not going to tell the truth! He
                 was diving for the gold!

      Harmsway sits, and addresses Bond, matter-of-factly:

                              HARMSWAY
                 It seems - Mr. Bond - that Miss Winch
                 has told me the most incredible story: A
                 sunken British warship filled with gold;
                 a British cutter firing on her; billions
                 of dollars in bullion lying on the
                 bottom of the Strait.

      Bond isn't enjoying this charade.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Obviously, the British government
                 denies all of this -

                              SIDNEY
                 - I told you! He was there! -

                              HARMSWAY
                 - But as I've explained to Sidney,
                 without proof, there's just no story.
                 Don't you agree Mr. Bond?

      Before Bond can answer -

                              SIDNEY
                 But I have proof! You ran out of here
                 so fast, I didn't get to show you.

      Bond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: Harmsway
      wasn't expecting her to have proof; Bond knows that if she shows him
      the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) Harmsway will probably kill
      both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (forcing a smile)
                 ...And what's that, my dear?

                              BOND
                 Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -

      Sidney cuts Bond off, DROPPING THE GOLD BAR on Harmsway's desk.

                              SIDNEY
                 He brought that up from the wreck.

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...I see.

      Alarmed, Bond wants to stop Sidney from reaching into her bag again -

                              BOND
                 Sidney, I wouldn't -

      Too late. She drops the uranium tooth on his desk.

                              SIDNEY
                 And what about this? Any idea what this is?

      Silence. Harmsway and Bond exchange a sober look. Then:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ... I believe it's a depleted uranium
                 drill bit, my dear.

      HE PRESSES AN ALARM UNDER HIS DESK. Bond reaches for the DRILL TOOTH.

                              BOND
                 Why don't we just take these -

                              SIDNEY
                       (blocking him)
                 No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.

      Harmsway stands, comes around the desk:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...Well! I do believe this requires
                 further investigation!

                              SIDNEY
                 Thank you, Uncle Elliot.

                              HARMSWAY
                 No matter what the British government
                 says, I won't kill this story.
                       (his secretary appears in the doorway)
                 Miss Oxford will show both of you to
                 the elevator... And one of my people
                 will definitely be in touch sooner
                 than later.

                              BOND
                 I'm sure they will.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good-bye, Mister Bond.

      He reaches to kiss Sidney - and looks in her eyes a second too long.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Good-bye, darling.

      Watching them exit, his smile turns hard and bitter.

      INT. ELEVATOR HALLWAY - DAY -

      As the Executive Secretary escorts them to the elevator, Bond glances
      out the PICTURE WINDOW, with its view of the other tower.

                              EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 Thank you both for coming in...

      BOND'S POV - EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS -

      Five floors directly down is the GLASS-ENCLOSED SKY BRIDGE; just
      above him, he sees TWO WINDOW WASHERS being pulled up on a TWO MAN
      SCAFFOLD.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      A CHIME SOUNDS; the elevator doors open. Bond and Sidney ad-lib
      good-byes to the secretary and get in.

      INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

      Sidney presses the button for "1". Bond glances at the FLOOR INDI-
      CATOR with reads "55" - clocks the SECURITY CAMERA - and starts
      looking for an ESCAPE PANEL. Sidney watches out of the corner of her
      eye, thinking he's nuts.

                              BOND
                       (glancing at the security camera)
                 ... Do you have a gun?

                              SIDNEY
                 What?

                              BOND
                       (yanking it down)
                 You heard me. A gun?
                       (disabling it)
                 I left mine in the car.

                              SIDNEY
                 That's funny: you struck me as the kind
                 of man who always carries protection.

                              BOND
                 Listen to me! I'm a British secret
                 service agent. And we have about two
                 minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.

      He glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car.

                              SIDNEY
                 Has anyone ever suggested that you're
                 a paranoid psychotic?

      Bond ignores the insult, explaining as he moves under the panel:

                              BOND
                 Harmsway sank that ship and stole the
                 gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.
                       (boosting himself up)
                 And thanks to your little show and tell -
                       (straining to open the panel)
                 - giving him the evidence -
                       (popping it open)
                 We're the only ones who can tie him
                 to the crime.

                              SIDNEY
                 Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!

                              BOND
                 Blood or Dutch?

                              SIDNEY
                 He was my father's best friend!

                              BOND
                 He's killed closer.

                              SIDNEY
                 You are seriously deranged.

                              BOND
                 Maybe. But why are we going up
                 instead of down?

      He nods to the FLOOR INDICATOR. She looks: 60, 65, 70. IT STOPS.
      Bond reaches down to her -

                              BOND
                 Sidney, come with me -

      THE DOORS OPEN. She looks at his outstretched hand with disdain:

                              SIDNEY
                 Not if my life depended on it.

      INT. 70TH FLOOR -- DAY

      Sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction. The elevator
      doors CLOSE behind her. To the right, she sees STAMPER and a
      Harmsway-blazered GUARD, with MACHINE PISTOLS.

                              SIDNEY
                 Thank God! He's crazy!

                              STAMPER
                 Does he have a gun?

                              SIDNEY
                 No.

      On Stamper's reply -

                              STAMPER
                 Good -

      He lunges for her, grabs her, spins her around, overwhelming her.
      She struggles, yelling:

                              SIDNEY
                 This is a mistake!

                              STAMPER
                       (gun against her skull)
                 Shut up!

      Using Sidney as a HUMAN SHIELD, Stamper marches her in front of the
      closed elevator doors. The guard follows. THEY POSITION THEMSELVES
      FOR A MASSACRE. Reaching around Sidney, Stamper pulls out his RADIO:

                              STAMPER (into radio)
                 Open 14.

      A beat. It opens. The men unleash a HAIL OF BULLETS, then realize -

      NEW ANGLE - (INT. ELEVATOR) -

      The car is empty. Stamper perplexed. Pushing Sidney in front of
      him, he enters the elevator, cautiously... When, suddenly:

      BOND SWINGS DOWN OUT OF THE ESCAPE PANEL (like an athlete on a high-
      bar) FEET FIRST - barely clearing Sidney's head as he KICKS Stamper
      and the Guard in their faces. They go flying backwards.

      Bond jumps down, grabs Sidney -

                              BOND
                 Need a lift?

      And boosts her into the escape panel, following her up.

      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE THE ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) -

      Bond and Sidney rush forward to the front wall as -

      STAMPER AND THE GUARD -

      Recover, grab their guns, move to the threshold, and START RAKING THE
      CEILING WITH GUNFIRE.

      ELEVATOR SHAFT -

      Bond presses his body against Sidney, on the front wall, trying to
      SHIELD HER as BULLETS RIP UP THE FLOOR behind them. With his free
      hand, Bond reaches up for the LATCH to open the door above them.

      INT. ELEVATOR -

      Stamper stops shooting. Moves to the rear of the cab, under the
      escape panel. Peers up. Sees nothing. Turns to the Guard:

                              STAMPER
                 Help me up.

      ELEVATOR SHAFT -

      Stamper's head pokes up through the hole just as Bond and Sidney have
      disappeared into -

      INT. HALLWAY - (ELEVATOR BANK) - 71ST FLOOR.

      Squeezing out from between the elevator doors, (which immediately
      close behind them,) Bond and Sidney encounter a group of STUNNED
      OFFICE WORKERS, waiting for the elevator.

                              BOND
                       (to the office workers)
                 ... I'd try the stairs.

      As Bond and Sidney scamper off -

      RETURN ON STAMPER - IN THE ELEVATOR -

                              STAMPER
                       (rushing out)
                 The stairs!
                       (barking into his RADIO)
                 Attention all units! They're on the
                 71st floor!

      INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY - ANOTHER PART OF THE BUILDING -

      Harmsway is striding towards the SECURITY CENTER, RADIO in hand:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Stamper! They're not to leave this
                 building alive!

      BOND AND SIDNEY - (INT. HALLWAY) -

      Moving cautiously toward a CORNER of ANOTHER HALLWAY.

                              SIDNEY
                 This has got to be a mistake.

                              BOND
                 The only mistake is that they didn't
                 kill us in the elevator.

      At the corner, Bond STOPS, SEEING A GUARD, farther down the hall (his
      back to them) CHECKING DOORS.

                              BOND
                 Wait here.

                              SIDNEY
                 No. I'm going with you.

      Bond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue. They start doing a
      "DUCK AND COVER" in and out of doorways TO SNEAK UP ON HIM.

      INT. SECURITY CENTER -

      Harmsway bursts in on GUARDS watching a WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Where are they?

                              GUARD #1
                 I don't see them -
                       (scanning the monitors)
                 There!

      INSERT VIDEO MONITOR - (SURVEILLANCE SHOT OF HALLWAY) -

      Bond and Sidney have just come into frame, sneaking up on the GUARD.

                              HARMSWAY (OVER)
                 Warn him!

      CLOSE ON THE GUARD - (INT. HALLWAY) -

                              VOICE ON RADIO
                 Porter! They're behind you -

                              GUARD
                       (lifting the radio to reply)
                 Roger! Over and -

      BAM. BOND DECKS HIM.

                              BOND
                 Out.

      Bond kneels, grabs the GUARD'S MACHINE PISTOL, and CLIPS, just as -

                              SIDNEY
                 JAMES!

      TWO GUARDS have entered from a STAIRCASE DOOR, hoisting MAC-10's. In
      an instant: (1) Bond lets go a BURST. (2) The Guards SHOOT back,
      diving for cover in the staircase door. (3) Bond rolls, (4) Pushes
      Sidney into an open DOORWAY, and (5) returns A BURST, from -

      INT. SMALL KITCHEN/COPIER ROOM -

      Sidney is shaken. As Bond stands in the doorway, guarding them -

                              SIDNEY
                 Okay. So it wasn't a mistake.
                       (Bond lets go a blast)
                 What do we do now? Offer them
                 dinner?!?!

      Bond glances back at the KITCHEN SUPPLIES. GETS AN IDEA. He sud-
      denly TWISTS, SMASHING the BUTT OF HIS GUN down on some GLASSWARE on
      the counter, then TWISTS BACK, returning a BURST OF GUNFIRE.

                              BOND
                 Come here. You shoot. I'll cook.

      She thinks he's nuts, but squeezes next to him. Handing her the gun:

                              BOND
                 Aim that way.

      Sidney scowls - as Bond moves off-camera - when suddenly, BULLET HITS
      RIP UP THE DOOR FRAME. She jumps, TERRIFIED.

      Bond looks at her from the PHOTO-COPYING MACHINE, where he is YANKING
      OUT the TONER CARTRIDGE. He offers a simple piece of advice:

                              BOND
                 Shoot back!

      Sidney frowns... Turns... And as she LETS THE GUN RIP, we cut to:

      INT. STAIRWELL - (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING) -

      Stamper, running up steps with the guard. They exit into:

      A SHORT SERVICE HALLWAY - 71ST. FLOOR -

      They rush though it, bursting through a door into:

      THE ELEVATOR BANK HALLWAY -

      Stamper and the Guard start hunting Bond.

      RETURN ON SIDNEY (HALLWAY/KITCHEN) -

      As she continues to exchange fire with the guards...

      BOND, (having broken the toner cartridge open,) is DUMPING THE TONER
      in a coffee can. He reaches for a BOX of sugar

                              BOND
                 One second -

      And (with GUNFIRE SFX over,) Bond sweeps the BROKEN DISH into the
      can, and drops his Q LIGHTER in the mix.

      He moves to Sidney, in the doorway. Kneels. In-between shots:

                              BOND
                 ... How did you get into marine
                 salvage?

                              SIDNEY
                       (gun burst, then)
                 My father left me the business.

      Bond glances at his watch, timing the bomb. The guards shoot; she
      shoots back, then explains:

                              SIDNEY
                 I used to be a divorce lawyer in New
                 York City.

      Bond nods, continuing to look at his watch. Glances at her:

                              BOND
                 Not a lot of difference.

                              SIDNEY
                 What do you mean?

      Bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can -

                              BOND
                 Either way, you're taking the goods
                 from dead hulks.

      He tosses the can, and PULLS HER BACKWARDS, covering her.

      NEW ANGLE - THE HALLWAY -

      The GUARDS spring from the door, rushing forward to storm Bond's
      position - just as the COFFEE CAN rolls towards them, and EXPLODES.

      RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -

                              BOND
                 Let's go -

      Taking the gun, the two of them start for the door when -

      NEW ANGLE - OPPOSITE END OF THE HALLWAY - CORNER -

      Stamper and the GUARD have arrived at the corner, BLASTING.

      RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -

                              BOND
                 Damn!

      Swiftly, Bond grabs a JUG of CLEANER from under the sink, moves to
      the door, and ROLLS IT DOWN THE HALL in Stamper's direction.

      STAMPER AND THE GUARD - (HALLWAY CORNER) -

      Anticipate a bomb. They move back.

      BOND AND SIDNEY (INT. KITCHEN) -

                              SIDNEY
                 What the hell does that do?

                              BOND
                 Cleans dirt. Let's go.

      INT. HALLWAY -

      Bond and Sidney BREAK for the STAIRCASE DOOR. (Where the first Guards
      were shooting at them from.) TWISTING AROUND, Bond lets a BURST go
      in Stamper's direction, as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead
      guards' MAC-l0's.

      INSERT - BOND'S BULLETS RIP UP THE JUG OF CLEANER.

      BOND AND SIDNEY ESCAPE FROM THE HALLWAY -

      STAMPER -

      Cowers, waiting for the jug to blow up... Then realizes:

                              STAMPER
                 It's a trick! After him.
                       (into his radio, on the run)
                 They're in the south stairwell!

      HARMSWAY, IN THE SECURITY CENTER -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Get more men up there!

      INT. STAIRWELL - LANDING -

                              SIDNEY
                 Down?

      Bond leans over the railing. Sees GUARDS coming UP. SHOOTS.

                              BOND
                 Up.

      They go up about three stairs, and Sidney sees GUARDS descending.

                              SIDNEY
                 Down?

                              BOND
                       (shoots, then)
                 Up.

      Bond and Sidney bound up the stairs through a METAL DOOR, just as -

      INT. HALLWAY -

      Stamper and the Guard bound down the hallway, heading for the door.

      INT. SECURITY CENTER -

      Harmsway smiles, watching Bond on a monitor:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ... And so much for that.
                       (into radio)
                 They're on the 72nd floor set-back.
                       (explains to the guards)
                 Nowhere to go.

      EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TERRACE SETBACK - TWILIGHT -

      It's magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback. Bond
      sees a WINDOW WASHER'S RIG. And although Sidney asks -

                              SIDNEY
                 Now what?

      Bond's first concern is to make sure Stamper can't get them. Amidst
      a pile of CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, he spots a PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN. He
      grabs it, and -

      BANG. BANG. BANG. He fires 3 NAILS through the door into the frame.

                              BOND
                 That should buy us some time.

      Now, Bond moves to the WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - a two-man bucket-like
      scaffold ON TRACKS, with TWO LEATHER SAFETY HARNESSES inside, and a
      LARGE CABLE SPOOL/MOTOR that stays on the roof.

      Approaching it, Bond looks over the side:

      BOND'S POV - LOOKING DOWN FROM 72ND FLOOR -

      Twenty stories below is the sky bridge. 50 stories below that, the
      ground. It's a long, long, way down.

      RETURN ON BOND - AT THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - TERRACE SET-BACK -

                              BOND
                 Help me move this.

      INT. STAIRWELL -

      Darting up the few steps, Stamper and Guards arrive at the door. He
      tries to open it. Won't budge.

                              GUARD
                 I'll call for a battering ram -

                              STAMPER
                 No. Get the fire ax.

      One of the guards grabs it from inside a FIRE CABINET. He hands the
      AX to Stamper, who takes the first SWING AT THE DOOR.

      RETURN ON BOND - TERRACE SET-BACK - EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Bond is positioning the window washer rig. He explains:

                              BOND
                 We'll go down close to the sky bridge.
                 We may be able to swing over and use it
                 for cover.

      As Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side.

                              SIDNEY
                 No way. I sail. I do not fly.

      BANG! Behind them, Stamper's AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR.

                              BOND
                 ... Sometimes, you just have to take
                 the plunge.

      Bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts
      down, as fast as they can go.

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - AERIAL -

      Bond and Sidney descend. Tiny specs against the sunset.

      INT. STAIRCASE -

      Stamper gives the last few chops to the door. He kicks it open.

      EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR -

      Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR -

      Bond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress.

                              SIDNEY
                 All I know is one thing: If we get
                 out of here alive, that gold is mine.
                       (beat)
                 I've earned it.

      Looking upward, Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail. BOND FIRES.

                              BOND
                 One thing at a time.

      EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - TWILIGHT -

      Stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. Ax in hand, he moves to
      the WINDOW WASHING RIG'S MACHINERY -

      And takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but instead of
      cutting it, the ax BOUNCES OFF, and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS TRACKS.

      THE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) -

      Swings! Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out. Bond grabs her. They
      are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE, swaying like a giant
      pendulum - although still descending.

      RETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Having failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding it.
      He swings. Swings again. With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHER'S RIG) -

      Dropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn bucket.

      STAMPER - WIELDING THE AX -

      Finally, the pulley shaft SHATTERS. THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT.

      BOND AND SIDNEY -

      are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge.

                              SIDNEY
                       (panicked, anxious, fast)
                 What now? And don't give me some
                 movie cliché like 'trust me.'

                              BOND
                       (what the hell)
                 Trust me.

      And with this, he turns, and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW.

                              BOND
                 Let's go -

      But as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS! THE CABLE SUDDENLY
      DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER, BELOW THE WINDOW.

      THE TERRACE SET-BACK -

      Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. It's coming loose
      from its moorings.

      BOND AND SIDNEY -

      look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what
      (she thinks) is certain death:

                              SIDNEY
                 We're going to bounce off that thing!

      Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper
      cuts the cable. HE GRABS HER:

                              BOND
                 Hold on!

      TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. With a GREAT CLAT-
      TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS, smashes into the wall,
      and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.

      THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG -

      Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way. They start to free-fall.

      BOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky bridge.

      THE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS -

      BOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH, INTO -

      INT. 50TH FLOOR SKY BRIDGE -

      Landing on the deck of the bridge. Bond rolls to his feet as -

      Fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck. Bond
      yanks Sidney to the side of the building, just as THE CABLE DRUM,
      PULLEY, AND THE REST OF THE MECHANICS CRASH ON THE WALK-WAY.

      72ND FLOOR TERRACE SET-BACK -

      Looking down, Stamper flips open his radio.

                              STAMPER
                       (over radio)
                 They're on the bridge. Seal off the
                 50th floor!

      INT. SECURITY CENTER -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (looking at the monitors)
                 I should have hired this man.
                       (to his guards)
                 Get somebody up there!

      INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

      Bond is moving to the window washer rig debris.

                              SIDNEY
                 What about the elevators?

      He steps to the side of the bridge, and looks at the railings: Four
      inch pipe. Bond begins to work feverishly:

                              BOND
                 We tried that already. Remember?

      Bond picks up the cable and the leather harnesses.

                              SIDNEY
                 You know, this is as much your fault
                 as it is mine.

      Bond is slipping the cable around the railing pipe. One loop.

                              BOND
                 Sidney, we don't have time for this -

      He pulls on the loop to test it. Good enough. Makes a second loop.

                              SIDNEY
                 Sure! Just when I want to talk -
                       (beat)
                 Not that I would have believed you -

      Bond tests the second loop. He's satisfied. Turns to her:

                              BOND
                 Put your back to the railing. Sit up
                 on it.

                              SIDNEY
                       (doing it)
                 Are you listening to me?

                              BOND
                 Put your arms around my neck. Lock
                 your legs around my waist.

                              SIDNEY
                 ... We have time for that?

      Just then, GUARDS APPEAR OUT OF FAR ELEVATOR DOOR. Running, THEY
      SHOOT. BOND FIRES A BURST BACK as - A NEW ROUND OF BULLET HITS
      BEGINS TO RAIN DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE.

      BOND LOOKS UP: Stamper has commandeered a second window washer's
      rig, and is descending, FIRING AT THEM.

      Bond looks at Sidney -

                              BOND
                 Sometimes you just have to -

                              SIDNEY
                 Don't say it.

      She locks her arms and legs around him, he snaps the leather harness
      around her waist, and they roll over the railing Amidst gunfire.

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - TWILIGHT

      Bond and Sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up.

      They go down,

      And down,

      And down -

      RETURN ON THE RAILING - (INT. SKY BRIDGE) -

      The cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent; the
      PAINT ON THE RAILING IS BURNING OFF, and the STEEL itself is STARTING
      TO SMOKE from the friction.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - DROPPING -

      Dropping -

      And Dropping.

      Looking to the ground, Bond sees the PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY
      coming up fast from below. It looks like they're going to get
      splattered on the tile floor, when -

      RETURN ON THE RAILING - SKY BRIDGE -

      The cable comes to the end of its run! It DRAGS THE SPOOL, THE
      BUCKET, and all the other MECHANICS to the side of the bridge,
      SMASHING AGAINST THE WALL, JAMMING AGAINST THE RAILING.

      EXT. THE PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY - TWILIGHT -

      Bond and Sidney jerk to a halt. They're swinging about five feet
      from the balcony. There's a pause...

                              SIDNEY
                 Is this - like - a normal day for you?

                              BOND
                 It's a lousy job, but -
                       (reaching for the balcony)
                 The only reason I stay is for the
                 health benefits.

      Bond PULLS THEM OVER TO THE BALCONY.

      INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

      Stamper lands on bridge. He unbuckles his harness, runs to railing,
      looks down and sees SIDNEY AND BOND climbing out onto the balcony,
      going for the PRESS ROOM DOOR.

                              STAMPER
                       (into his radio)
                 They're heading for the press room.
                 Stop them!

      INT. PRESS ROOM -

      Bond and Sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs Bond came down
      earlier to meet Harmsway.

      The Presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening.

      At the "start" end of the presses - where the paper is fed in - Bond
      sees a GIANT ROLL OF NEWSPRINT on a CRANE, about to be loaded.

      Directly beyond this is the door to the elevator/wash-up room where
      Bond and Harmsway exited earlier. -

      Coming out of that DOOR, Bond sees THREE GUARDS in Harmsway Blazers
      carrying guns.

      BOND shoots the HOOK on the CRANE CARRYING THE NEWSPRINT ROLL.

      It CRASHES TO THE GROUND, rolling backwards on the guards. As they
      start scrambling around it -

      Bond and Sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc-
      tion (toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage...)

      They encounter a GORILLA-SIZED PRESSMAN, with an oversized crowbar.

      Bond and the Pressman square off. Bond tries to get around him. The
      man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it. Bond tries to block the
      descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half.

      Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing
      each other against the side of the press...

      Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and
      pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,
      Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -

      And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops
      him on the head with the crowbar.

      Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -

      But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out
      from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.

      Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard
      as he comes to finish Bond off.

      The Guard stumbles backward -

      Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. (A large machine that
      wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.)

      Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the
      BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that
      as Bond turns -

      The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.
      Seemingly at once, (1) Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, (2) Bond
      ducks, (3) the Guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) -

      Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,
      pulling Sidney away at the last moment.

      The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...

      The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT RED.

                              BOND
                 He was bad news.

      Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase, Bond grabs Sidney
      and the gun, and runs to the NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CHUTE.

                              BOND
                 Down there!

      They jump into it, sliding down, and around an ALUMINUM CHUTE into:

      INT. GARAGE - HARMSWAY TOWERS.

      Bond and Sidney come out near a TROLLEY stacked with newspapers.

      Hearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise -
      they're ready for almost anything, except what they HEAR:

      The SOUND OF ONE MAN APPLAUDING. A polite, almost bored clapping.

                              HARMSWAY (O.S.)
                 Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding
                 performance.

      Harmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS, shoulder to shoulder, in a
      straight line, all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond.

                              HARMSWAY (continuing)
                 I'm the certain the British taxpayers
                 would be impressed by your efforts.
                 Don't you agree?

                              BOND
                 I think they'd rather know who stole
                 their gold.

      Harmsway can't help his ego:

                              HARMSWAY
                       (chuckles)
                 Why, I did, of course. It's on the
                 Sea Dolphin II, twenty miles outside
                 of Hong Kong... Not that it will do
                 either of you any good to know.
                       (beat)
                 Now both of you: Stand up. And toss
                 the gun out, Mr. Bond.

      Bond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him... And THROWS A LOOK
      TO HIS CAR, noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH.
      Bond begins to scheme.

                              SIDNEY
                 Uncle Elliot: How could you do this
                 to me?

      Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Oh, please, Sidney. There's a
                 hundred billion dollars at stake.
                       (beat)
                 Besides, I never really liked your
                 father that much. He cheated at cards.

      Bond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL. He palms it.

                              BOND
                 Are your guards really going to kill
                 a helpless girl?

                              HARMSWAY
                 My guards are from South Africa, Mr.
                 Bond. This is their chance to get even
                 with the formerly 'Great' Britain.
                       (beat)
                 Now both of you. Put your hands on
                 your heads, and step forward.

      Holding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head. He's
      manipulating the control into the right position to use it.

                              BOND
                       (trying to buy time)
                 What did you do, Harmsway? Make some
                 deal with the Chinese government for
                 the gold?.. Was the radioactive
                 uranium I found in Venice part of it?

      He finally has the remote control in the right position.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Questions, questions, Mr. Bond...
                 Which I'm afraid I've neither the
                 time, nor the inclination to answer.
                       (to the guards)
                 Take them out to the jungle and -

      Suddenly, BOND'S CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR. The GUARDS TURN, in
      shock TOWARDS THE CAR, as:

      BOND retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the
      newspaper trolley, while -

      THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, sending the guards scrambling.

      BOND takes his position with Sidney.

                              BOND
                 I forgot to mention: The job comes
                 with a car.

      007 begins shooting, as -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Kill it! Shoot the damn thing -

      THE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR. They manage to shoot
      out the headlights, while -

      BOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same
      time. As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them -

                              BOND
                 Here. You shoot. I'll drive.

                              SIDNEY
                 ...You know, that's another reason
                 you're probably not in a successful
                 relationship.

                              BOND
                 Another reason??? Did I miss something???

                              SIDNEY
                       (taking the gun)
                 You insist on calling all the shots.
                       (beat)
                 And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.

      Bond eyes her for one split second. Points at the guards:

                              BOND
                 Aim that way.

      Sidney starts to shoot as -

      THE GUARDS continue to blast away at the car... But:

      THE WINDOWS DON'T SHATTER.

      THE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS...

      THE TIRES DON'T GO FLAT.

      There's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND STEERS
      THE CAR TO THEIR POSITION, where the door opens automatically.

                              BOND
                 Ready? Now!

      The two of them make a break for the car, DIVING INSIDE.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - GARAGE -

      - Bond guns the engine, slams the transmission into gear. Burning
      rubber, GUARDS bounce off the front fenders.

      THE GUARDS -

      Continue to shoot at the car.

      OTHER GUARDS -

      Run for the HUM-VEES. Hop in and chase.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      Bond flips open a hidden control panel. Flips a switch.

      EXT. BACK OF BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      The TAIL-LIGHTS DROP DOWN and MACHINE GUNS start to fire.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      Bond glances at the REARVIEW MIRROR. Sees the HUM-VEES. Presses
      another switch -

      CLOSE ON BOND'S EXHAUST PIPE -

      Whoosh! A MISSILE blasts out, trailing smoke as it hones in on -

      THE FIRST HUM-VEE.

      BOOM! It's decimated.

      ANGLE ON HARMSWAY - ON HIS RADIO -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Seal the garage! Cut the power!
                 He's got no headlamps!

      INT. GARAGE - FIRST TURN -

      As the car screeches around a corner, the overhead lights go out.

      INT. BOND'S CAR -

      Bond flips down the visor: A THERMAL IMAGING DISPLAY drops down.

      INSERT "HEADS UP" IMAGING DISPLAY -

      It looks just like the jet fighter videos from the Gulf War.

      INT. GARAGE - SECOND TURN - UP RAMP -

      Bond's car roars around a second turn, with sparks flying as it
      scrapes the walls. AHEAD, a MASSIVE ONE-PIECE DOOR is FOLDING DOWN
      FROM THE CEILING. A city street beyond.

      INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING -

                              SIDNEY
                 We're not going to make it!

      Bond flips down a control panel from the RADIO. A DIGITAL DISPLAY
      begins to run through a set of numbers. Bond explains:

                              BOND
                 If it's radio controlled, it'll break
                 the code.

                              SIDNEY
                 If not?

                              BOND
                       (pointing to a button)
                 We blast through.

      THE CAR APPROACHES THE CLOSING DOOR AT HIGH SPEED -

      BOND SEES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. HE PUNCHES THE MISSILE BUTTON.

      TWO MISSILES ROAR OUT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR -

      THEY EXPLODE AGAINST THE CLOSING DOOR - TO NO EFFECT.

      BOND'S CAR GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER -

      SIDNEY SCREAMS! BOND BRACES, AND -

      BOOM! CRASH! SILENCE. BLACK. After a moment, we HEAR THE SOUND OF
      FOOTSTEPS ON CEMENT.

      INT. GARAGE -

      The lights come on. The car is a twisted wreck, smashed against the
      wall. Bond and Sidney are slumped forward, unconscious.

      Harmsway KNOCKS TWICE ON THE GARAGE DOOR, to demonstrate:

                              HARMSWAY
                 - Built to withstand a nuclear blast.
                       (to Stamper, checking
                        Bond's pulse)
                 Are they alive?

                              STAMPER
                 Yes. Shall we kill them?

                              HARMSWAY
                 No. I have a better idea. In fact,
                 Mr. Bond may have actually improved
                 my original plan.
                       (beat)
                 Bring them both to Hong Kong. And
                 Make sure he has nothing else up his
                 sleeve.

      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR - HONG KONG - MORNING -

      It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating
      restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an
      LA Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk;
      where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes
      and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256... While the
      captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones.

      At the end of the harbor, dominating this scene, the CAMERA FINDS:

      THE FIVE SMOKESTACKS OF THE ABERDEEN HARBOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.

      Panning down this massive dockside facility, the image changes to:

      THE SAME SCENE ON A 5" PORTABLE VIDEO MONITOR -

      With one important difference: There's an HNN logo in lower corner.

                              ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (VO)
                 As part of our continuing report on
                 terrorism, we're outside Hong Kong's
                 Aberdeen Harbor nuclear power plant...

      NEW ANGLE (EXT. POWER PLANT, FRONT ENTRANCE, WATERSIDE) -

      Two VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER interviewing a
      middle-aged CHINESE MAN. We don't see the reporter's face; from the
      "over the shoulder" news angle, he's WEARING A HAT.

      (There's also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground, and a
      seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier.)

                              ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
                 - Interviewing Mr. David Chin, senior
                 engineer in charge of security.
                       (beat)
                 Tell me, Mr. Chin: How safe is this
                 plant from a terrorist attack?

      He holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin.

                              CHIN
                 Totally secure. Without codes, you'd
                 need a missile to blast through the
                 front door; you normally can't even get
                 this close (to the plant) without a full
                 security clearance.

                              ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER
                 ...Could you say that a little closer
                 to the microphone?

      He pushes the microphone closer to Chin's face:

                              CHIN
                 Of course. You'd need -

      Suddenly, A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE... And
      CHIN COLLAPSES. The HNN reporter TAKES OFF HIS HAT: IT'S YUNG.

                              YUNG
                       (to the guards)
                 Now!

      At once, the two cameramen turn: One AIMS his shoulder-mounted video
      camera at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA; the other aims at the FRONT DOOR.

      BOOM! ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses, destroying both.

                              YUNG
                 Let's go!

      As Yung and the cameramen rush forward -

      ANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT -

      Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box
      of equipment. He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on deck:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Get the machine in the water!

      They begin using a hoist to lift one of the "worms" from a hold.
      (This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo, with an antenna on top,
      and no flexible tubing attached.)

      INT. HALLWAY/RECEPTION - POWER PLANT -

      Yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception/security area:

                              POWER PLANT GUARD
                 What happened out there?

                              YUNG
                 A generator blew. Nothing to worry about.
                       (beat)
                 But I need one last shot of you. Why
                 don't you stand by the alarm?

                              POWER PLANT GUARD
                 No problem.

      The guard stands, and smiles, posing for the video camera... And Yung
      pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots him.

                              YUNG
                       (to the cameramen)
                 Up the stairs!

      They follow Yung up a set of stairs leading to the reactor control
      room. Meanwhile, back at the HNN boat:

      INT. CABIN - HNN BOAT

      Bond is at the porthole, wearing only shorts, trying to figure a way
      out. He hears the door click open, and -

      A Guard enters carrying a pile of Bond's clothing with his shoes on
      top. Stamper is behind him, holding a gun on Sidney.

                              STAMPER
                 Put on your clothes.
                       (to the guard)
                 Cuff him.

      The guard cuffs Bond's hands (in the front,) and we cut back to:

      INT. POWER PLANT CONTROL ROOM -

      Yung and the Cameramen sweep into the control room: Lots of con-
      soles, with a window overlooking the REACTOR CORE, and its
      surrounding blue COOLING POOL.

                              YUNG
                       (to the half-dozen engineers)
                 I'm sorry to interrupt again. But we
                 need one more picture for the story.

      The engineers ad-lib replies: "Sure." "Okay." Yung smiles:

                              YUNG (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you line up against the
                 wall? Let's make it a group shot.

      The engineers line up against a wall. The cameramen take positions
      for a massacre. And at the first sound of gunfire, we cut to:

      EXT. ENTRANCEWAY -

      Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs.

                              BOND
                 Sleep well?

                              SIDNEY
                 Next time, I do the driving.

      Bond gives her a look.

      RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -

      Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a portable
      version of the "worm" controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II.

                              YUNG
                 The drill is in the water;
                 approaching the intake tunnel.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Excellent.

      Harmsway looks up, hearing:

                              BOND
                 I see you're in your natural element,
                 Harmsway: A room filled with lethal
                 power...
                       (beat)
                 ...With a toxic core at its center.

      Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at
      gun point,) with Stamper and a guard. Harmsway is charming as ever:

                              HARMSWAY
                 Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney...
                 You're just in time for a nuclear
                 meltdown!

      Coming closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him -

                              SIDNEY
                 You bastard -

      Stamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage.
      He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember
                 you fondly.

                              YUNG
                       (calling from the console)
                 Approaching the first gate.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Start the grinders.

      UNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL -

      The "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the
      grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars.

      RETURN ON CONTROL ROOM -

                              BOND
                 ...So that's what the weapons grade
                 uranium was for.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of
                 minutes, the boring device will
                 arrive at the core of the reactor...
                       (beat)
                 And when the radioactive blades cut
                 into the plutonium -

                              BOND
                 - Instant melt-down.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Chernobyl will look like a campfire.

      Young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. Bond decides to try
      rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun, unnoticed.

                              YUNG
                 We're through the first gate.
                 Approaching the second -

                              BOND
                       (demanding)
                 Why, Harmsway? Wasn't stealing the
                 gold enough?

                              HARMSWAY
                       (to Yung)
                 Bore through.
                       (to Bond, chuckling)
                 ...They used to say living well was
                 the best revenge, Mr. Bond.
                       (beat)
                 They're wrong.
                       (beat)
                 Revenge is the best revenge.

                              YUNG
                 Entering the main tunnel - ten
                 minutes to target -

                              BOND
                       (fiercely)
                 What could you possibly have to be
                 vengeful for, Harmsway? Still trying
                 to prove yourself to daddy?

      This infuriates Harmsway. Bond moves closer to the gun.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!

                              YUNG
                 You have to leave -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (enraged, ignoring Yung)
                 A hundred and fifty years ago, my
                 ancestors took this island - a
                 barren, lifeless rock - and turned it
                 into the greatest city known to
                 modern civilization.
                       (beat)
                 And now that I'm being forced to give
                 it back, I intend to return it in
                 exactly the same condition: A
                 barren, lifeless rock.
                       (beat)
                 The gold is merely reparations -
                 payment from the spineless British
                 government who wouldn't listen.

                              BOND
                       (to Sidney, glancing at the gun)
                 ... I think Uncle Elliot is having
                 his own melt-down.

                              YUNG
                 Approaching the third gate -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Smash through it!
                       (then)
                 Laugh all you'd like, Mr. Bond - but
                 you fit perfectly in to my plans.
                       (he reaches for a newspaper)
                 Here. This just in. Newsflash.
                 Read all about it.

      He thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond, holding the top half out as
      Bond reads THE HEADLINES, sourly:

                              BOND
                 ... Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear
                 meltdown... British agent found in
                 reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway
                 calls for British government to resign.

      Harmsway smiles at Bond:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow
                 never lies.

                              BOND
                 What about the gold?

                              YUNG
                 You must go. Now. Otherwise the
                 boat won't be out of range -

      Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Thirty seconds.
                       (then, to Bond)
                 That's the most brilliant part of the
                 plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy,
                 I'll let the new British government -
                 my British government - announce that
                 the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong
                 - where no one will be able to touch
                 it for a hundred years.
                       (beat)
                 And just by coincidence:

      He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline:

                              HARMSWAY
                 ...Gold mine opens in Vietnam.
                       (turns to Stamper)
                 Let's go. Put them in the airlock.

      Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun.

                              BOND
                 You'll never get away with it,
                 Harmsway. Too many people know.

      Bond tenses, ready to spring -

                              HARMSWAY
                 Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the
                 crazies - the conspiracy theorists?
                 The Oliver Stones of the world?
                       (pausing, then, with great scorn:)
                 I'll publish their books, I'll make
                 their movies, I'll put them on my TV
                 shows!
                       (beat)
                 They're my bellboys. They carry my
                 luggage.

      Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Now. Get them in the airlock.

      Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off -

                              BOND
                 One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And
                 the handcuffs. They'll give it away.

      Harmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm.

                              SIDNEY
                 No. I want to stay with him.

      Bond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he
      realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could
      hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"...

      But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's
      running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (breaking the moment, cynically)
                 How sweet.

                              SIDNEY
                       (satto, to Bond)
                 My timing always was lousy.

                              BOND
                       (cold and hard)
                 I'd rather die alone.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs.
                 We'll drown her at sea.

                              SIDNEY
                       (to Bond, sarcastically)
                 Enjoy the rest of your life.

      As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:

                              HARMSWAY
                 I'll meet you on the boat, south of
                 Lantau Island.

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      The door closes. Bond looks out the small window at:

      HARMSWAY AND YUNG IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

                              YUNG
                 Take the men. I can finish alone.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (to the technicians and cameramen)
                 You come with me -
                       (to the guard who handcuffed Bond)
                 You stay here.

      As they exit -

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      Bond has yanked his shoes off. He pulls out the PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVE
      SHOELACES and opens the SECRET COMPARTMENT IN HIS HEEL, revealing a
      DETONATOR, and EAR PLUGS.

      Moving quickly, Bond BITES OFF a 2-inch piece of shoelace, and wraps
      it around the chain-link connecting his handcuffs, while...

      INT. CONTROL ROOM -

      Yung sits down at the worm control and explains to the guard:

                              YUNG
                 We'll cut through the last gate, then
                 set it on auto-pilot.

      He starts to maneuver the joystick, and -

      UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL -

      The worm turns a corner. We see -

      THE WORM'S POV - (INT. INTAKE TUNNEL MOVING) -

      100 feet ahead: An iron gate. Beyond it, the blue lights from the
      reactor cooling pool... And beyond that... THE REACTOR CORE, a
      shimmering silver target.

      Meanwhile, back outside, at -

      THE DOCK -

      Water sprays violently as the HNN boat thunders out of Aberdeen
      harbor with Harmsway at the helm. Junks and sampans are tossed in
      his wake, as

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      Bond finishes pressing the SHOELACES AROUND THE DOOR LOCK... Then
      TURNS UP HIS SHIRT COLLAR TO PULL OUT A WIRE that's been hidden
      inside.

      He connects it between the explosive on the handcuff chain and the
      detonator, then steals a glance out the window at:

      YUNG -

      still guiding the worm with the joy stick. His eyes are focused on:

      THE CONTROL PANEL (INCLUDING VIDEO SCREEN, SHOWING WORM'S POV) -

      Where Yung sees the gate looming ahead on the video screen. He
      presses a nearby button marked "START GRINDERS"... And the video
      goes black, replaced by the words "GRINDERS ENGAGED."

      UNDERWATER -(INTAKE TUNNEL) -

      The worm bares its lethal teeth; and revs up to speed. Meanwhile -

      BOND -

      Closes his eyes, presses the detonator, and -

      YUNG -

      HEARS a small BOOM from inside the airlock.

                              YUNG
                       (to the guard)
                 Check it out. Be careful.

      The guard picks up his machine pistol, starts to the door.

      INSIDE THE AIRLOCK -

      Bond (with his hands now free) is quickly rewiring the detonator to
      the plastique explosive around the door handle.

      YUNG MANEUVERS THE JOY-STICK, AS -

      UNDERWATER (INTAKE TUNNEL)

      The worm's teeth are beginning to cut into the steel bars.

      THE GUARD APPROACHES THE DOOR.

      BOND BRACES HIMSELF INSIDE THE AIRLOCK.

      THE GUARD PEERS INTO THE WINDOW -

      And suddenly... BOOM! The door blows open with a shattering blast!

      NEW ANGLE - THE CONTROL ROOM -

      The guard is blasted backward, dead. Bond rolls out, scrambling for
      the weapon. Yung slams his hand on a button marked "AUTO-PILOT." A
      caption appears on the video screen "TARGET LOCKED," and -

      As Bond grabs the gun, bringing it up to shoot, Yung dives on top of
      him. They struggle, and the gun skitters across the floor towards
      the window overlooking the blue cooling pool.

      Breaking free, Bond moves around a console for the gun. Yung takes a
      shortcut - leaping on, and then over the console, as -

      THE WORM (UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL) -

      Chews through the last of the iron bars, and glides through the hole
      toward THE SILVERY REACTOR CORE, 35 feet ahead.

      BOND AND YUNG -

      have squared off in a short, brutal MARTIAL ARTS battle.

      (The fight takes place in the space between the consoles and the
      reactor core window; the gun, lies on the ground between them.)

      They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his own,
      Yung is every bit his equal.

      Backing off, Bond spins into a crescent kick -

      But Yung catches Bond's foot, and shoves Bond backwards, crashing
      against a wall near a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

      Meanwhile, all through this...

      THE WORM IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE CORE.

      RETURN ON BOND AND YUNG -

      As Yung reaches down for the gun, Bond grabs the fire extinguisher
      from the wall. He rushes Yung, blasting him with CO2.

      In the white smoke, Yung drops the gun... Then CHARGES at Bond,
      headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007... SMASHING BOND
      BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW.

      THE WINDOW SHATTERS. Bond is winded. And as he struggles to stop
      himself from falling backwards into the reactor room...

      Yung does a FLYING, FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job -

      But at the last second, BOND DUCKS, reaches up, and uses Yung's
      momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into -

      THE REACTOR ROOM.

      He sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as -

      THE WORM CLOSES IN ON THE SILVER REACTOR CORE.

      SCREAMING, YUNG HITS THE WATER FEET FIRST, AND -

      UNDERWATER (REACTOR CORE) -

      THE WORM BURROWS IN ON HIM.

      RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -

      Bond races to hit the "EMERGENCY REACTOR SHUT DOWN" button. He pulls
      a FIRE ALARM, disconnects the worm, and sets off an "EMERGENCY
      DECONTAMINATION" system, spraying the room with a mist of water.

      Finally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at:

      THE REACTOR POOL (BOND'S POV) -

      There's a cloud of RED in the middle of the blue water.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Bond goes to the dead guard. Gets the key, removes his handcuff
      bracelets, then hoists the dead guard over his shoulder, and exits.

      EXT. HELICOPTER - (EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR POWER PLANT) - DAY

      With the sound of fire engines approaching in the background, Bond
      straps the dead guard into the passenger seat, and takes off.

      EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II - (AERIAL - SOUTH CHINA SEA) - DAY

      The HNN boat has pulled alongside the Sea Dolphin II. The gang from
      the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat.

      (Note: From the air, we should notice that the "gold hold" is now
      covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open,
      hanging from a steel boom.)

      THE DECK -

      Coming up the ladder first, Harmsway is greeted by the Captain.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Any news?

                              THE CAPTAIN
                 The call just went out on the Hong
                 Kong police radio: Fire at the power
                 plant.

                              HARMSWAY
                       (ironically)
                 Alert the media!

      Stamper and Sidney have climbed onto the deck.

                              STAMPER
                 What do you want me to do with her?

                              SIDNEY
                 - Can't we make a deal? I won't say
                 anything -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (touching her cheek)
                 You're so cute, my dear.
                       (beat)
                 But I'm afraid not.
                       (to one of the cameramen)
                 Put her in the storage room.

      The cameraman takes her away. Harmsway turns to the captain:

                              HARMSWAY (CONT'D)
                 We'll get rid of her when we're in
                 International waters.
                       (then)
                 Set sail, full speed, due south.
                 I'll be in my cabin. Let me know
                 when Mr. Yung arrives. We'll break
                 out the champagne.

      INT. LOWER PASSAGEWAY/STORAGE ROOM - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Near the engine room (indicating we're near the bottom of the boat,)
      the cameraman opens a door to a small, cramped room with a bench, and
      SCUBA EQUIPMENT. He pushes Sidney inside.

                              CAMERAMAN
                 Don't get any ideas.

      Then locks the door on her.

      EXT. BOND'S HNN HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY

      Several hundred feet in the air, the helicopter is heading for an
      island in the distance.

      INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING -

      Bond checks the compass, and adjusts his course. The COMPASS SWINGS
      DUE SOUTH.

      BOND'S POV -

      The helicopter clears the island: Bright blue sea ahead. Bond sees
      then passes over - the HNN boat, bobbing empty in the water...

      Then, further ahead, he spots the stern of Sea Dolphin II, shimmering
      in the instance.

      REAR DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Looking north, off the back of the boat Stamper and a crewman see the
      helicopter - a tiny speck in the air.

                              STAMPER
                 There it is.

      Stamper lifts a pair of BINOCULARS for confirmation.

      STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -

      He sees two figures in the cockpit.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Stamper picks up his radio:

                              STAMPER
                 It's him. They both made it.

      THE BRIDGE -

      The Captain replies:

                              THE CAPTAIN
                 I'll tell Sir Elliot.

      HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      Harmsway is working at a computer. A chime sounds.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Yes?

                              CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                 He's approaching from the north, sir.

                              CREWMAN
                 Fantastic. Invite the crew on deck
                 to celebrate, and I'll be up in a few
                 minutes.

      INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY -

      Bond is about two miles out from the stern of the Sea Dolphin II.
      Maybe 500' in the air.

      Taking the machine pistol from the dead guard's lap, he opens the
      small pilot's window, and balances it on his knees. Ahead, he sees:

      BOND'S POV - DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      The crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad, near the
      ship's railings.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Ready for war. He pushes the cyclic pitch lever forward, and the
      Bell Jetranger goes into a screaming descent.

      THE DECK/HELICOPTER LANDING PAD

      Champagne bottles pop. Stamper is with a crewman, who looks up at
      the chopper, about 1000' off the stern:

                              CREWMAN
                 He seems to be coming in awfully fast.

      Stamper picks up his binoculars.

      STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -

      He sees Bond.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

                              STAMPER
                 Get the guns! It's not him! It's
                 Bond!!!

      He might have also added "It's too late," as -

      NEW ANGLE - REAR DECK OF THE BOAT/HELICOPTER -

      Bond SWOOPS IN LOW on the port side of the boat, FIRING HIS GUN from
      the pilot's window, and using the CHOPPER'S BLADES to threaten the
      men on deck.

      About half of them DIVE INTO THE WATER FOR SAFETY, only to be quickly
      left behind.

      Flying up the port side toward the front of the boat, Bond passes -

      INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      The windows rattle as Bond's chopper thunders by. Perplexed,
      Harmsway stands, opens the porthole curtains. He cranes his neck,
      but sees nothing. He presses an intercom button:

                              HARMSWAY
                 What the hell is going on?

      INT. BRIDGE -

                              THE CAPTAIN
                       (on a phone)
                 I don't know sir -

      The helicopter suddenly appears in front of him. Shooting from the
      pilot's window, Bond shatters the glass windows -

      And the Captain slumps forward on the wheel, spinning it as he slides
      to the deck.

      INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      The boat pitches wildly; Harmsway looses his balance, crashing into a
      wall.

      INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      Sidney is thrown from her bench, slamming against scuba tanks.

      EXT. MID-SHIP - DECK -

      Stamper bounces himself, handing out AUTOMATIC WEAPONS from an arms
      cache hidden inside a DINGHY.

      The two cameramen take their M-16's and rush forward, jumping up on
      some machinery to climb onto -

      THE ROOF OF THE BRIDGE -

      They rush forward, and assume positions shooting at Bond.

      ANGLE ON THE HELICOPTER -

      Taking hits. Bond pivots and turns the chopper, heading straight for
      them.

      BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER) -

      The men turn, and start to run as the chopper chases them -

      CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER'S LANDING SKIDS -

      BOND HOOKS BOTH OF THEM WITH THE SKIDS, BY THE BACK OF THEIR UNTUCKED
      SHIRTS!!!!   The man are flailing like crazy as -

      BOND PULLS BACK ON THE CYCLIC PITCH LEVER -

      THE HELICOPTER REARS BACKWARDS, AND UP -

      And the men burst through their shirt buttons, FALLING, SHIRTLESS,
      into the sea.

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      Bond pushes the cyclic sideways to bank down, and in, on the boat.
      But he doesn't see -

      WIDE - (BOAT/HELICOPTER)

      A SMALL ROCKET STREAKING UPWARD from the boat. Stamper is holding a
      shoulder mounted launcher.

      THE HELICOPTER -

      BOOM! It hits the engine.

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      The gauges go crazy; the alarms go berserk. The entire cockpit is
      chattering as Bond struggles to remain in control.

      EXT. LADDER LEADING TO THE BRIDGE -

      HARMSWAY is trying to make his way up the ladder as the boat
      continues to veer out of control. He pauses to look up at:

      THE HELICOPTER, GYRATING WILDLY -

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      Bond forces the cyclic forward. The helicopter pitches forward -

      BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER)

      He's heading straight for the hatch covering the gold hold. Whoever
      is left alive is diving off the ship to get out of the way.

      INT. BRIDGE -

      Struggling with the wheel, Harmsway picks up the radio:

                              HARMSWAY
                 What the hell is going on?

                              STAMPER (O. S. )
                 It's Bond!

                              HARMSWAY
                 Kill him! Finish it!

      ANGLE ON STAMPER (EXT. MID-SHIP) -

      With the worm dangling from a boom in the background, he watches:

      EXT. HELICOPTER/SHIP

      With the chopper about 15 feet above the gold hold - just barely
      under control - Bond opens the door.

      He leaps out onto the hatch, and rolls off, disappearing as -

      THE CHOPPER CRASHES onto the gold hold, in a GIANT BALL OF FLAME and
      twisted metal.

      INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT -

      Sidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion.

      INT. BRIDGE -

      Harmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead
      captain, and pushes the body out.

      EXT. PASSAGEWAY -

      With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily
      moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship.

      (Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any
      threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.)

      Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the
      passageway, then pokes his head inside -

      And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown
      against a railing.

      Bond looks up:

      STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his
      head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached
      to the boom by a thin metal cable.

                              STAMPER
                 You're mine now.

      Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch.
      With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him
      against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck.

      As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a
      wall, and THE WORM comes to life.

      Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm.

      Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond
      against the wall with his free hand as he -

      MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD.

      With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose -

                              STAMPER
                 I'm going to do this slowly -

      Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles
      sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm -

      But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is
      rushing at Bond full force, with the worm.

      Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews
      into the wall.

      Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same
      action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond.

      INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE -

      With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in
      the cable, on the ground.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in
      the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain -

      And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE
      SIDE OF THE SHIP.

      UNDERWATER -

      The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull.

      SIDNEY - (INT. STORAGE ROOM) -

      Hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall.

      HARMSWAY - (INT. BRIDGE) -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (barking into the radio)
                 Stamper! Report in!

      EXT. DECK/PASSAGEWAY -

      As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick -

                              HARMSWAY'S VOICE
                       (continuing, on Stamper's radio)
                 Report to the bridge!

      BOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing
      taught as the worm wends its way underwater.

      Stamper rushes Bond -

      And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around
      Stamper's neck.

      Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and -

      STAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as -

      INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      THE WORM BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL! A torrent of water floods in,
      pushing Sidney off to one side.

      WORM'S POV - INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      It's zooming at the door!

      INT. PASSAGEWAY -

      The door bursts open, sending tons of water into the passageway.

      INT. BRIDGE -

      The boat shudders violently, sending Harmsway crashing against a
      wall, cutting his head.

      EXT. THE DECK -

      As the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge,
      using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper:

      First climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof.

      INT. STORAGE ROOM -

      Sidney is thrashing for air, with only a few inches left between the
      rising water and the ceiling.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY -

      3/4 filled with water. Rising fast.

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY)

      The worm is heading for a door. We see the door disintegrate in
      front of us, as the worm bursts into -

      THE ENGINE ROOM.

      With the water cascading over the camera, (as if we were riding
      inside an ocean wave,) the worm heads for a tank marked "FUEL."

      EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      The boat is sinking. Bond is running across the bridge roof, when:
      THE BOAT SUDDENLY LISTS TO THE STARBOARD SIDE.

      INT. BRIDGE -

      Harmsway is thrown backwards. Gun in hand, he makes his way up the
      incline, to the port-side door.

      Just when he thinks he's made it -

      Bang. Bond appears in the doorway, having jumped down from the roof
      on the small exterior walkway. He's seething with rage.

      Harmsway looks up at him. Blinks in disbelief.

                              BOND
                 I never believe what I read in the
                 newspapers.

      Harmsway slowly brings up the gun.

                              HARMSWAY
                 Pity you'll miss your obituary.

      Bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt. Moves closer.

                              BOND
                 Where is she, Harmsway?

      BOOM! The fuel tanks explode in the distance. The bridge rocks
      violently; the room tilts to a greater angle.

                              HARMSWAY
                 You want to kill me, Bond? Go ahead.

      With both arms, Bond pushes Harmsway backwards, flinging him downward
      against the starboard wall. The water is rising on the bridge.

                              BOND
                       (moving in on him)
                 Where is she Harmsway? -

      He grabs Harmsway by the lapels, and throws him against the front
      wall, crashing onto the instrument panel head first.

      Harmsway laughs maniacally, face down on the gauges:

                              HARMSWAY
                 What is it, Bond? You haven't the
                 guts?

      Boom! There's another explosion in the background! The front of the
      boat tilts upward! The water is rushing in!

      Bond grabs Harmsway by the shoulder -

                              BOND
                 You spineless paper tiger -

      And yanks him off the instrument panel, flinging him backwards
      against the rear wall of the bridge.

                              BOND
                 Where is she, Harmsway?!? Or did you
                 kill her like Paris?

      Suddenly, THE BOAT GROANS. The BRIDGE RISES OUT OF THE WATER! AND
      BOND loses his balance, FALLING ONTO HARMSWAY -

                              HARMSWAY
                       (glaring, insanely:)
                 We all go down together!!!

      Harmsway lunges for Bond's throat -

      AND THE BRIDGE SLIPS UNDERWATER -

      Where Bond breaks Harmsway's grasp in a violent struggle - then
      punches him. Air bubbles break from Harmsway's mouth. He
      frantically tries to break free for the surface -

      But Bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on
      Harmsway's shoulders.

      Harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at
      Bond in a haze of bubbles...

      Then falls still.

      With his lungs aching, bursting with fire, Bond rockets up -

      UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -

      through the bridge windows, up to -

      THE SURFACE.

      He breaks through the water, gasping for air... And then, almost
      instantly, dives down again.

      UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -

      Bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could
      just grab it, and stop it from sinking.

      He goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away,
      just beyond his reach.

      And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his
      breath a second longer -

      A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM.

      Bond turns in disbelief. Stares into the mask: IT'S SIDNEY. She
      puts her regulator in Bond's mouth...

      And they share the air as they rise from the depths.

      THE SURFACE -

      They break through the water. Sidney yanks off her mask. Teases:

                              SIDNEY
                 What do you mean, you'd rather die
                 alone?

                              BOND
                 I didn't say when I want to die -

      She splashes him. Turning away, Bond spots Stamper's 'arms cache'
      dinghy floating nearby.

      NEW ANGLE - THE DINGHY -

      Bond climbs into it, then helps Sidney get in. They collapse in the
      bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale.

      After a beat, SIDNEY CLEARS HER THROAT. Bond is already amused:

                              BOND
                 ... Yes???

                              SIDNEY
                 Before we go any further here, Mr.
                 Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just
                 want to get two things straight.

                              BOND
                 ... Yes?

                              SIDNEY
                 First, that boat is in international
                 waters. I'm claiming it for salvage.
                 One-third of that gold is mine.

                              BOND
                 And number two?

                              SIDNEY
                 If you think we're going to have some
                 kind of 'life affirming' romance here
                 just because we cheated death, let me
                 be clear:
                       (pause)
                 We're going to have it where I want,
                 and when I want.

                              BOND
                 And when might that be?

                              SIDNEY
                 Now.

      He laughs. She falls into his arms. They kiss, and we cut to:

      TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS -

      With the dinghy reflected in the glass. In unison, they are both
      lowered, revealing Q and Wade.

                              Q
                 ... As usual, I see the situation is
                 in 007's very capable hands.

                              WADE
                 Life is not fair.

                              Q
                       (emphatically)
                 You're right.

      A British naval officer appears.

                              OFFICER
                 Excuse me, Major Boothroyd - the
                 message went to London.

                              Q
                 Thank you.

      Q and Wade throw a glance back to the sea, then turn, waking off:

                              WADE
                 Tell me, Q-ster. You do ever do any
                 gardening?

                              Q
                 ...The only thing I ever planted was
                 bugs.

      CLOSE ON A PICTURE OF HARMSWAY ON A VIDEO SCREEN -

      On the wall behind M's DESK. It's night. Moneypenny sits across
      from M, with a steno pad.

                              M
                 Moneypenny, take the following release:
                       (beat)
                 The body of Sir Elliot Harmsway was
                 found floating in the South China Sea
                 this morning, at 08:00 hours local
                 Hong Kong time.
                       (pauses)
                 At present, local authorities believe
                 the media mogul committed suicide.

      RETURN ON THE DINGHY -

      Bond and Sidney break off a kiss. She lies nestled in his arms.

                              SIDNEY
                 James... Is this really what a
                 typical day is like for you?

      Bond replies with a wry smile:

                              BOND
                 Yes...
                       (pause)
                 But some days... Are longer than
                 others.

      And with this, he reaches up over his head, and pulls a tarp over the
      two of them...

      And the camera pulls back, and up, rising into the air to reveal:

      The entire British Navy closing in on them from all points of the
      compass.


                                    THE END

                           (save for one last line:)

                            James Bond will return.

______________________________________________________________________________


                                "TOTAL RECALL"

        FADE IN:

1       EXT. DESERT - DAY

        All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange
        sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in
        "Gone with the Wind".

        SUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit.

        PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below...
        the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and
        odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust,
        which alternately obscures and then reveals the image.
        CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in
        the process.

        SLOW DISOLVE

        OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.

        ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre
        rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.
        DISSOLVE.

        ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some
        enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect-
        ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks
        toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion
        through the red dust.  DISSOLVE...

        ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the
        arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is
        reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face,
        though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are
        some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES
        optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE.

        CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front.
        It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move)
        towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.

        As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be
        stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a
        terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of
        fragments which hurtle toward the camera...


2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW "SPHINX" - DAY

        A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH
        THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him,
        as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face,
        especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS
        over a portion of it.

        The surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious;  the walls
        are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two
        different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material
        and red quartz, which glistens like crystal.

        The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear-
        fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD.
        Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man,
        and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a
        SATANIC suggestion to the scene.

        Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT
        WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it.

        We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING
        OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to
        SAFETY.

        ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE;
        with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see --
        ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED
        BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out
        of molten lava.

        SUPERIMPOSE MAIN TITLE:

                                TOTAL RECALL

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


3       INT. BEDROOM IN SMALL APARTMENT - MORNING

        DOUGLAS QUAIL and his wife KRISTEN, are asleep in bed.

        Gradually the room lights BRIGHTEN.  The CLOCK CHIMES and
        begins SPEAKING in a soft, feminine voice.

                                 CLOCK
                           (sweetly)
                   Tick, tock, seven o'clock.  Time
                   to rise and open your eyes.

        They don't budge.  Shortly, the clock CHIMES again.

                                 CLOCK
                           (continuing)
                   Tick, tock, seven-oh-one.  Time
                   to get up, the day had begun.

        Quail's wife stirs.  Maddeningly, the clock CHIMES a third
        time.

                                 CLOCK
                           (continuing)
                   Tick, tock --

        Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off.  Then he sits up
        in bed.

        He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the
        edge of the bed.  He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in
        thought.

        He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early
        thirties.  He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is
        attractive and rather off-hand towards him.

        Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing
        for her slippers.

                                 QUAIL
                   I dreamed about Mars again... it
                   was bizarre, yet is was so real...

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (casual)
                   It's your time of the month again.

        Quail looks at her quizzically.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing;
                            world-weary air)
                   At least once a month.  Douglas
                   Quail's obsession.  For twelve
                   years you've been talking about
                   Mars.

                                 QUAIL
                   People do go to Mars, you know.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   That's right, Douglas.  But not
                   you.  Not us.

        Quail looks crestfallen.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing;
                            disdainful)
                   As it is, we can barely scrape by
                   on your lousy ten thousand a week.

        She leaves the room.  He meditates on what she said,
        depressed.


4       INT. KITCHENETTE - MORNING

        Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast.
        On the WALL is projected the front page of a NEWSPAPER.

        Drinking his coffee, Quail studies the wall with the air
        of a man who had his "node stuck in a newspaper," ignoring
        his wife.

        The newspaper headline reads:  "RIOTING ON MARS OVER WATER
        TAX."

        His wife is reading a different article:  "Four Women Rape
        Man in Park."

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (mumbling)
                   What do they expect ... the
                   way men dress these days ...
                   then they scream rape.

        Quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesn't hear her.

                                 QUAIL
                   You know -- let's really do it.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Rape men in the park?

                                 QUAIL
                   No.  Go to Mars.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (withering)
                   Go to hell.

                                 QUAIL
                   We can pool our savings and
                   I've got some sick leave
                   coming, besides my regular
                   vacation...

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (interrupting;
                            corrects herself)
                   ...more of a half-wit.  For
                   a start a war could break out
                   there any day ...

        She gestures toward the TV screen where Martian police
        are keeping protesters behind a barrier.  Some have signs
        reading "A FREE MARS", "DOWN WITH COHAAGEN", "EARTH - OUT"
        etc.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's just media talk.  They're...
                           (indicating
                            the protesters)
                   ...just a minority.  They're
                   powerless.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Well, there's a lot of things
                   we need around here before
                   we waste our money on a trip
                   to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm
                   just a slave around this dump.
                   Now if you were capable of
                   finding a better job....

        The kitchen clock chimes and talks.

                                 CLOCK
                   It's now eight.  You'll be
                   late!

                                 QUAIL
                   I'll be late!

        He jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and
        briefcase, kisses KIRSTEN's perfunctorily offered cheek
        and leaves.


4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING

        CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern
        street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus)
        pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a
        plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and
        gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on
        briskly.


5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING

        Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a
        weapons check before proceeding to the platforms.

        TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass
        through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body
        of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly
        carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.

                                 GUARD
                   No weapon again, Mr. Quail?

                                 QUAIL
                   I keep forgetting, Herb.  They
                   frighten me.

                                 GUARD
                   Yeah?  Well, it's the law,
                   Mr. Quail.  Has been since
                   1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow -
                   ya carry ya gun or ya get
                   reported.

        GUARD gestures to his associate.  They've obviously been
        through this with Quail before.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay.  Herb, okay.

        Quail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives.
        Signs above each approaching car say "CAR FULL", "ROOM
        FOR 10 PERSONS", etc.  Quail goes to a carriage marked
        "NEW CAR".


6       INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY

        The doors open and the crowd surges on.  Quail grabs a
        seat.  At intervals throughout the car are VIDEO MONITORS
        on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                   -- more violence today from Mars's
                   strike-torn ore colonies --

        Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks
        instantly at the word "Mars."

        The NEWSCASTER is a young black man.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                           (continuing)
                   ...but Earth Intelligence Operations
                   Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly
                   worried about the damage to Mars's
                   all important tourist
                   industry was today dismissive
                   of the dissident groups....

        TV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur-
        rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with
        news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a
        striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.

                                 COHAAGEN
                  We're dealing with a bunch of
                  extremists and unrepresentative
                  lunatics.  Mars is a happy and
                  prosperous protectorate of Earth...
                  and will remain so.

        The train stops at another station and more people pile on.
        Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies
        passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the
        image.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                   There have been some criticisms,
                   sir....

                                 COHAAGEN
                   I have no further comment.

        The news conference ends and a bright looking young man
        comes on the screen.  Quail continues to watch, though
        not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story.
        Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                   Good morning, commuters.  This
                   portion of your trip is brought
                   to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you
                   have a dream that never came
                   true?  Do you aspire - but
                   only perspire?  Has the great
                   adventure passed you by?  Then
                   come to... REKALL, where what
                   might have been will have been.
                   For the memories of a
                   lifetime... REKALL.

        Quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't
        seem to take it very seriously.  He glances away as a card
        comes on the screen with REKALL's numbers.


6B      INT. QUAIL'S OFFICE - DAY

        Quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive
        of a room.  Numerous people are typing information onto
        the screens.  Quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful.  He
        then types in a little more information, then pauses again.
        On the screen, a sentence types itself...

        WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED?  REQUEST MORE INFORMATION.

        Quail read it and continues.


9       INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - REKALL - DAY

        Scene opens on a CU of McCLANE, a genial, bubbling, enthus-
        iastic man.

                                 McCLANE
                   We're all dreamers, Douglas.
                   But here at Rekall, dreams
                   are our business.

        He presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which
        they are seated appear to be in outer space.  Countless
        stars glitter all around.  Startlingly, a comet whizzes by.
        Quail is amazed.  McClane grins and presses the button
        again.  The scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral
        reef.  Multi-colored fish swim around the chairs and desk.

                                 QUAIL
                   But... is the process really
                   that effective?  A false
                   memory!?

                                 McCLANE
                           (shaking his head;
                            smiling)
                   We prefer the term "extra-
                   factual implant".  Your
                   memory will be complete in
                   every way.  You will have
                   gone to Mars.  We guarantee
                   that.

                                 QUAIL
                   Is it in any way dangerous?
                   I mean, the medical techniques?

                                 McCLANE
                   Not when you deal with
                   qualified operators - like
                   us.

        He presses the button again and the normal office returns.
        Quail looks around, impressed.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's just - incredible.

                                 McCLANE
                   And look at our follow-up
                   program!

        He puts items on the desk as he talks.

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   Space-flight ticket stub...
                   passport... vaccination
                   certificates... matchbooks
                   from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine
                   Restaurants, souvenirs, post
                   cards... even names of people
                   you met - now back there -
                   who you can call and discuss
                   your trip with... by the way,
                   we plant these things where
                   you'll come across them at
                   random in the future.

                                 QUAIL
                   But... I'll know I hired you.
                   That'll destroy the whole
                   illusion.

                                 McCLANE
                           (smiling; self-
                            satisfied)
                   But you won't remember me, or
                   having been here.

                                 QUAIL
                   I won't?

                                 McCLANE
                   Your money back if you do!
                   We've never paid out yet.

        Quail slumps backs in his chair, overwhelmed.

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   And we have a special this
                   month, for only two-hundred
                   thousand dollars more.

        At the press of a button, a list appears on the wall...

        A14  MILLIONAIRE PLAYBOY
        A15  SPORTS HERO
        A16  INDUSTRIAL TYCOON
        A17  INTELLIGENCE AGENT

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   You can have a new identity
                   for the duration of the trip.
                   Pick one.

        Quail's eyes linger on "Intelligence Agent."

                                 QUAIL
                   "Intelligence Agent"... wouldn't
                   that be dangerous?  I might
                   attack....

                                 McCLANE
                           (airily)
                   No.  No.  You're a retired
                   agent.  Mars was your last
                   mission and you're never to
                   break your cover.  But you'll
                   have got the girl, killed the
                   baddies, and saved the
                   Universe.  Not bad, eh?

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't know... about the
                   whole thing... it's all such
                   a fake.  I won't really have
                   gone.  I won't really....

                                 McCLANE
                           (kind but firm)
                   Let's face it, Douglas, you,
                   and millions of people like
                   you have no chance of ever
                   getting to Mars and you'd
                   never qualify as a secret
                   agent for EIO.  This - REKALL
                   - is the only way to achieve
                   your dream.

        He gets up and walks around to Quail's chair.

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   Think about it, Douglas.
                   Think, too, what a terrible
                   boor a real holiday is.
                   Lost tickets, endless arguments,
                   lousy hotels, missed connections,
                   rotten weather... Rekall will
                   supply you with perfect, happy
                   memories.

        Quail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced.


9A      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Quail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern
        chair.  Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on
        TV.  She casually lights a cigarette.

                                 QUAIL
                   You know that's illegal.

                                KIRSTEN
                   Yeah?  Who's going to report
                   me?  You?... wimp....

        She watches a torrid love scene on the video.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   Screwing around's illegal,
                   too.  But just give me half
                   a chance...

        Quail looks at her with distaste.  His expression changes
        to one of resolve.


10      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

        Quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside
        some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type
        smock.  In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some
        instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that
        apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The
        room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting.

        Quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the
        instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the
        dentist's, looking at the drills.

        The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE
        OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.  (A RUTH GORDON-TYPE.)

                                 OLD LADY
                   Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull.
                   Sorry I'm late.
                           (walks toward
                            coat closet)
                   I'll be right with you.

        She dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging
        suit, then slings on heavy, lead-lined protective vest.

                                 QUAIL
                           (looking at
                            instrument
                            console)
                   This really going to work?

                                 LULL
                   It the Pope Martian?

        Lull's assistant, the TECHNICIAN in b.g., who had been
        steadily working on the instrumentation, now looks over
        at Lull.

                                 ERNIE (TECHNICIAN)
                           (at machine)
                   Okay -- that's it.

        Now, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle
        attached to it.  Quail eyes it warily.  She swabs the back
        of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension.

                                 LULL
                   Now, just relax, kid.  This
                   ain't gonna hurt.  Just a
                   controlled drip of Narkadine.
                   When you're under, I'll just
                   ask ya a few questions, nothin'
                   real personal, just full
                   details of yer private life
                   so's we can tailor the
                   wish-fulfillment program to
                   your needs.

        She injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes
        it down.

                                 LULL
                           (continuing)
                   See?  Painless.  I didn't feel
                   a thing.  Hey, you're a nice
                   kid... you like a little
                   somethin' extra?

        Quail, embarrassed, starting to go under, nods.

                                 LULL
                           (continuing;
                            pleased)
                   Good!  Kid -- have I got a
                   girl for you!  She's gonna
                   like you.  You're good-lookin'.
                           (beat)
                   Gettin' sleepy?
                           (he nods)
                   Good.  Now, what's the first
                   thing you think of when you're
                   thinkin' about Mars?

                                 QUAIL
                           (wistfully)
                   Well... I'd like to see the
                   Martian Sphinx...

                                 LULL
                   Okay -- you will, Dougle!  I
                   want ya to start counting
                   backwards from a hundred for
                   me.

                                QUAIL
                           (sleepily)
                   One hundred... ninety-nine...
                   ninety-eight... ninety-seven...
                   ninety-six... ninety-five....

        His voice drops off; his eyes close.  Lull studies him,
        adjusts some instruments, then turns to Ernie, glancing
        briefly at a typed sheet in front of her.

                                 LULL
                   Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars;
                   number sixty-two... and throw
                   in that blonde... We'll give
                   him a real good time.

                                ERNIE
                   Sixty-two... and... the blonde...

        He takes two discs and inserts the first one into a machine.

                                 ERNIE
                   Boy, is this one wild.  He
                   won't want to come back.

        Ernie inserts the second disk.

                                 LULL
                   Dougie?  This Sophie Lull.
                   Can ya hear me?

                                 QUAIL
                   ...Sophie....

                                 LULL
                   Good! ... I'm gonna ask ya
                   a few more questions now.  Ya
                   think you'll be able to
                   answer 'em?

                                 QUAIL
                   ...Yes....

                                 LULL
                   Attaboy!  To begin with, I
                   wanna ask ya; -- You sex
                   life.  How many orgasms a
                   week?


11      INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - DAY

        McClane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse
        objects and placing them on his desk.

        These items apparently are objects Rekall, Inc. intends
        to "plant" for some client of theirs to find (perhaps
        even Quail) -- as part of his fantasy.

        While he is putting these things on his desk, the PHONE
        BUZZES.  He answers it.

                                 McCLANE
                   Yes?

                                 LULL (V.O.)
                           (filtered;
                            tense)
                   Howie?  Listen, you'd better
                   get in here.

                                 McCLANE
                           (not too
                            concerned)
                   Not another schizoid embolism.

                                 LULL (V.O.)
                           (filtered)
                   You'd better get in here.


12      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

        McClane come quickly in, brushing the swinging door open.

        Lull and Ernie look up as he enters.  Quail lies on the
        couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed.
        McClane looks queryingly at Lull, who motions him to
        silence.

                                 LULL
                           (bends over
                            Quail)
                   Quail?  Dougie, can you hear me?

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes.

                                 LULL
                   Tell McClane what you told us.

        McClane glances sharply at Lull, then turns to Quail.

        Quail's eyes open and scan the room.  They settle on
        McClane.  These eyes have changed:  they have become
        cold and steely.  In fact, Quail's entire personality
        seems to have changed -- his face has acquired a flint-
        edged hardness.  He is chillingly menacing.

                                 QUAIL
                           (a deadly
                            voice)
                   All of you in this room are
                   dead.

                                 McCLANE
                           (not quite
                            taking it
                            seriously)
                   What's he talking about?

                                 QUAIL
                   You've broken my cover.

                                 McCLANE
                   What is this?...

        McClane's eyes flash angrily at Lull.

                                 LULL
                   The Narkadine cracked a memory
                   cap.  Mars --
                           (she's scared)
                   He's really been there.

        There is a chilly silence in the room as McClane digests
        this.

                                 McCLANE
                   Forced suppression?

                                 ERNIE
                   With spontaneous breakthrough.

                                 McCLANE
                   Holy shit.

        They stare at Quail as if he's a ticking bomb.

                                 QUAIL
                           (coldly)
                   You've compromised the Sphinx
                   Project.  You'll have to be
                   silenced.

        Now they're all panicked.

                                 McCLANE
                   Wait a minute.  Quail --

                                 QUAIL
                   My name isn't Quail.

                                 McCLANE
                   Listen... whoever you are...
                   sir....
                           (almost
                            pleading)
                   ...This is all an accident.
                   We'll destroy all the records.
                   No one will know.  I swear it.
                   Believe me.

                                 QUAIL
                   I believe you, but that won't
                   stop E.T.O. from killing you.

        The Rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Killing you... killing you...
                   killing you....

        His voice trails off, his eyes close.

                                 LULL
                           (intensely)
                   He wants a false memory
                   implanted -- of a trip he
                   really took.
                           (pause)
                   Someone at Earth Intelligence
                   Operations erased his memory.
                   All he know was going to Mars
                   meant something special to
                   him.

                                 ERNIE
                   What do we do?  Graft a false
                   memory pattern over the real
                   memory of the same thing?

                                 LULL
                           (shaking her
                            head)
                  Uh-uh... That could promote
                  a partial breakthrough of
                  the real trip.

                                 McCLANE
                           (overlapping)
                   Revive him without any false
                   memory implantation and get
                   him out of here.

                                 LULL
                   Why don't we just wipe out
                   the memory of his visit
                   here?

                                 McCLANE
                           (nodding;
                            relieved)
                   Yes.  Good.  I'll destroy
                   his file and cancel his fee.
                   I have a feeling that the
                   longer he doesn't know who
                   he is, where he's been,
                   where he's going and who we
                   are, the better off we'll
                   all be.  I'm taking a holiday.
                   A real one.

        He leaves.  The others stare after him, looking very grim.


12A     INT. RECEPTION AREA OF REKALL - DAY

        A dazed and disoriented Douglas Quail comes out of an
        inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit
        door.

        An attractive RECEPTIONIST, her bare breasts visible
        through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then
        looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view
        Quail's progress.


12B     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

        Quail travels down.  Uncomprehendingly, he looks out at
        the city.


12C     INT. BUILDING FOYER - DAY

        Quail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer, oblivious
        to anything around him.  A red-headed man may or may not be
        watching him.  He makes a phone call from a pocket phone.


12D     INT. ROBOT TAXI CAB - AFTERNOON

        Scene open on Quail, in the back of the cab; he looks
        around, slowly coming to his senses.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where am I?

                                 DRIVER
                   Travelling south along Third
                   Avenue, passing Fourty-third
                   street.

        Although the driver's voice is a little mechanical (flat
        in tone) he is filmed from Quail's POV, and it isn't
        obvious he is anything other than an ordinary cab driver.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where am I going?

                                 DRIVER
                   Thirty-three thirteen "G"
                   Street, Sector "L", Twin
                   Towers, Apartment six-thirty-
                   five.

                                 QUAIL
                   How did I get here?

        Camera now cuts to a shot in front of the driver.  He is
        a fairly human-like robot.

                                 DRIVER
                   I don not understand the
                   question, sir or madam.

                                 QUAIL
                   How did I get into this cab?

                                 DRIVER
                   You stepped into it in the
                   normal manner, sir or madam.


15      INT. CORRIDOR OF QUAIL'S APARTMENT - DAY

        The reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is
        smart and clean, though not lavish.  A uniformed and armed
        DOORMAN is standing by the entrance door.

        Filmed from the elevator end of the area, we see the cab
        pull up and Quail alight and enter the building.  He nods
        to the doorman and approaches the elevators.  As he reaches
        them a MAN steps out from behind the camera.  A 2ND MAN
        enters from a door opposite the elevators.  Quail looks
        at them and becomes quite panicky.

                                 1ST AGENT
                   Aren't you the man from Mars?

        He takes a modern, lethal gun from his pocket.  Quail turns,
        but the other man is behind him.

                                 2ND AGENT
                   Don't give us a reason to
                   kill you.

        Quail looks toward the doorman, who is paying little
        attention to the events.  As the two men edge Quail towards
        the door, he call out...

                                 QUAIL
                   Mr. Zimmer...Mr. Zimmer...
                   help me... they're...

        But the doorman turns calmly away.


16      INT. BASEMENT CAR PARK - DAY

        The two men lead Quail past a number of cars to their own
        vehicle.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where are you taking me?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   You told everyone at Rekall
                   about you trip to Mars.
                   Where you went, who you worked
                   for, what you did --

                                 QUAIL
                   But I didn't... Are you telling
                   me... I did go to Mars?  I
                   don't remember?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   You've remembered too much.
                   The Sphinx Project, for a
                   start....

                                 QUAIL
                           (confused;
                            remembers only
                            fragments)
                   Sphinx?... No, no, I don't,
                   I... What about the people
                   at Rekall?  I don't recall
                   Rekall but you said if they
                   know what I did?  Why don't
                   you ask them?  They'll tell
                   you I didn't...

                                 1ST AGENT
                   They've been taken care of.

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you mean?

        Neither man bothers answering.  They arrive at their car
        and open the door for Quail.  He hesitates.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What are you going to do with
                   me?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   Get in the car.

        He slaps Quail hard across the face.  Quail is terrified.
        He is tearful with fear.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!  No!  You're going to
                   kill me!

        He cringes.  His hands across his face.

                                1ST AGENT
                   No one's going to kill you if
                   [you do what you're told.]
                   We're visiting E.I.O. for some
                   new tests.  Now get in, or do
                   we start playing rough?

                                 QUAIL
                   No!  It's not my fault!  You
                   can't do it!

        They start to force him into the car physically.

        Suddenly, Quail stops cringing.  the FEAR DISAPPEARS FROM
        HIS FACE, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Wait a minute, I remember --

                                1ST AGENT
                   What, Quail?  What do you
                   remember?

                                 QUAIL
                   On Mars... they tried to kill
                   me... And....

        QUAIL TRANSFORMS INTO A HIGHLY SKILLED KILLING MACHINE.

        In an instant, he karate-chops both agents across the
        windpipe, and they crumple to the ground.

        Quail steps back.  He stares at the two bodies, incredulous;
        then stares at his own deadly HANDS.  It is as though they
        belong to someone else.

        Then, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he
        races back into the basement door of his building.


18      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - EVENING

        Kirsten is watching another pornographic video when Quail
        bursts in.  He is still disoriented.

                                 QUAIL
                   Did you know I've been to
                   Mars?

        Kirsten gets up and turns off the movie.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   What!  This stupid obsess...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting)
                   I think I've been.  I vaguely
                   recall...

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Doug, you've got to forget...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting)
                   Forget?  Remembering is the
                   problem I must've been
                   to one of those artificial
                   memory places...

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Oh my God...

                                 QUAIL
                   But something went wrong...
                   something about a real
                   memory... and then those
                   men...  tried to kill me.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   What men?  Doug, you're crazy.

        She starts to mix a drink from a well-stocked cabinet.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   You're here now.  They didn't
                   kill you.

                                 QUAIL
                   No.  That's what's so amazing.
                   I killed them.  I think...

        Kirsten stops pouring her drink and look at him sharply.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Where?  Where are they?

        Quail points down with his finger.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   Doug!  It's something they
                   put into your mind at the
                   memory place.  Fantasies.
                   That's their business.

        She sips her drink.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   You're a computer operator.
                   You're a bore.  You're a
                   wimp.  You're not a killer.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm involved somehow with
                   E.I.O.  It's true.  It's no
                   fantasy.

        He walks around the apartment drawing curtains and putting
        out the lights.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Doug, I want you to see a
                   doctor.  Now Alec and Shirley
                   Turnbull have a good man.  He
                   helped Alec through his
                   breakdown.

                                 QUAIL
                   For fuck's sake, this is no
                   breakdown!

        Kirsten is taken aback at his use of language.  He strides
        into the bathroom and slams the door.  She turns on one
        lamp, goes to a telephone and dials.


19      INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

        Quail takes a washcloth, turns the hot water up full and
        soaks the cloth under the steaming water.  Using it as a
        compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to
        drain off some of the tension.

        He turns off the water.  Towelling his head dry, he opens
        the bathroom door.

        The instant he does this, a blinding white BURST OF LIGHT
        comes arcing into the bathroom, and the back wall crinkles
        and CHARS into a swatch of blackness.

        QUAIL DIVES OUT THE DOOR, just as ANOTHER BOLT incinerates
        the spot where he was standing.


20      INT. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT

        THE ROOM IS IN TOTAL DARKNESS.  The only thing visible is
        the pale rectangle of the balcony window, with the curtains
        drawn over it.

        QUAIL and his ASSAILANT cannot be seen -- but they can be
        HEARD.  There is the sound of a SCUFFLE -- the meaty THUD
        of a FIST CONNECTING WITH FLESH -- and a painful GRUNT as
        someone's breath whooshes out.

        The LIGHT COMES ON.  Quail is standing with one hand on the
        lamp, and the other twisting KIRSTEN's arm up behind her
        back.  A pistol lies on the floor.  Quail is totally stunned.
        He releases her arm, shoving her away from him, at the same
        time scooping up the pistol.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!  Did you say I need a
                   psychiatrist?

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (coolly)
                   I haven't seen you move that
                   fast since I've known you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (outraged)
                   How could you do it?  After
                   eight years!

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I'm not your wife, Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                   Not my wife!  You are out of
                   your mind.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (indifferent;
                            nursing her
                            arm)
                   It's a false memory implant.
                   I never saw you before six
                   weeks ago.

        Quail is totally disoriented.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why are you lying like this?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   No, Quail.  It's true.  You
                   work for E.I.O.  So do I.

        As she speaks, she walks to a picture on the wall and from
        behind it pulls out a small wallet.  She flips it open to
        show him her E.I.O. badge.  He looks down uncomprehendingly
        at the holographic lettering "Earth Intelligence Organisation".

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicating their
                            surroundings)
                   But why all of this?

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (shrugging)
                   We had to watchdog you...make
                   sure the erasure took.  A wife
                   seemed like a good idea.

                                 QUAIL
                   But I remember it!  All of
                   it!... Us!

                                 KIRSTEN
                   All implanted.

                                 QUAIL
                   Our friends... my work...
                   eight years.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   The job's real -- you've had
                   is six weeks -- since you got
                   back from Mars.

        He sits down, holds his hand to his head.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   It's all a fabrication, Quail.
                   Everything you know.

                                 QUAIL
                   This is crazy!  If all my
                   memories are false, who am
                   I?  What am I?  Jesus... it's
                   like I don't exist.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   You exist, all right.
                           (very cold)
                   That's the problem.

        A pause as Quail mentally gropes frantically, for what to
        do next.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why did you try to kill me?
                   Why does E.I.O. want me dead?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   They don't particularly.  That
                   was my idea.  This assignment was
                   boring me to death.  The
                   personality they gave you
                   wasn't too thrilling.

                                 QUAIL
                   Well, what did I do on Mars
                   that they have to keep me from
                   telling?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I've no idea.  I just work
                   here.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right... I'm leaving.
                   Don't try and follow me --

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I don't have to follow you.
                   You can't get away from E.I.O.
                   Nobody does.

        Quail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time.

                                 QUAIL
                   No wonder you got the role as
                   my bitchy wife -- type casting.

        He leaves.  Kirsten smiles secretively.  She goes to a
        drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks
        like a TV channel-changer.  There is a very small light
        on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as
        the instrument  begins to make BEEPING SOUNDS.


21      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Quail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his
        paces, trying not to look suspicious.  After a beat, he
        heads for the nearest subway entrance.


22      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

        Now underground, Quail tries to blend in with the other
        subway people.  He heads toward the weapons check.


23      EXT. STREET SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        An OFFICIAL VEHICLE slams to a halt next to the subway
        entrance and a whole load of INTENSE MEN pours out of it.


24      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        Quail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting
        to get through the WEAPONS CHECK.  He tries to control
        his nervousness.  He passes.  The guard smiles at him,
        pleased to see he has remembered his gun.


25      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        All the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway
        stairs.  The SUBWAY COPS and WEAPONS CHECK are stunned to
        see four large men brandishing guns push their way through
        the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them.  One
        gunman flashes a HOLOGRAPHIC BADGE ENCASED IN PLASTIC at
        them.

        The gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer
        to the subway train, which is just departing.  The men
        halt abruptly.

                                 FIRST GUNMAN
                   Fuck it!

        The second gunman adjusts a small plug - a radio receiver -
        in his ear.

                                 SECOND GUNMAN (EARPLUG WEARER)
                   We won't be able to track him
                   again until he comes up above
                   ground!


26      INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

        Quail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the
        night, not knowing exactly where he will go.  He is
        confused, distraught.  A commercial comes onto the video.

                                 TV AS VOICE OVER
                   Tired?  Exhausted?  Need a
                   vacation?  Don't settle for
                   memories, experience the real
                   thing.  Daily departures on the
                   space shuttle to Mars.  Visit
                   the wonders of....


27      EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

        Quail emerges from underground and looks around.  The
        streets are almost deserted.


28      INT. MOVING OFFICAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        THE GUNMEN SIT IN THE OV.  The one with the ear plug
        [suddenly talks.]

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Coming in again.  Loud and
                   clear.

        He looks down at an illuminated street map built into the
        car's dashboard.


28A     EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

        A cab comes into view.  Quail quickly hails it and jumps
        in.  Cab moves off.


28B     INT. CAB - NIGHT

        Quail is still pondering what to do next.  He glances out
        one window, though not at anything in particular.  Suddenly,
        the silence is shattered as bullets rip through the window
        on the other side.  Quail ducks to the floor.


28C     EXT. CAB - NIGHT

        A wide shot shows that the cab is being fired on by a man
        leaning from the window of an official patrol vehicle.  He
        is aiming at the tires and driver, rather than directly at
        Quail.


28D     INT. CAB - NIGHT

        Bullets are still pouring in.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                           (unemotionally)
                   You are being fired on, sir
                   or madam, please leave the
                   cab at once.

        From the floor, Quail pushes the door handle and rolls
        out onto the street.  The pursuing car occupants fail to
        notice his exit.


28E     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        Cars continue, as Quail picks himself up from the gutter
        and moves off down a narrow side street.


28F     INT. CAB - NIGHT

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                   [Please....]

        Bullets rip into the robot driver's neck, severing the
        head from the body.  The head hits the window then bounces
        back onto the front seat.  It continues talking.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                           (continuing)
                   ...leave the cab as bullets
                   are hitting the vehicle in
                   considerable quantities.


28G     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        The taxi mounts the footpath and smashes through the display
        window of a store.  Clothes models are scattered and broken.
        When the noise abates, the severed head of the robot driver
        is lying among the dummies.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                   This company, sir or madam,
                   will institute legal action
                   for damages...


29      EXT. STREET - "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL - NIGHT

        Quail emerges from the side street and sees "End of the
        Line" Hotel.  It is clean, bland, middle class.  He quickly
        crosses the road and enters.


29A     INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

        The foyer is brightly lit and empty.  Quail approaches the
        DESK CLERK, who is reading a book.  "Dr. No", marked, in
        flowing script, "from the classic series".

                                 DESK CLERK
                           (without looking
                            up)
                   Help you, sir?

                                 QUAIL
                           (handing over
                            money)
                   A room for the night.

                                 DESK CLERK
                           (reluctantly
                            putting down
                            the book)
                   ID.

                                 QUAIL
                           (handing over
                            money)
                   Here's ten thousand.  Forget
                   the ID.

        DESK CLERK looks up at him, with interest.  His hand
        hovers over the money.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   I have a liaison with a
                   lady... and I'm married...

                                 DESK CLERK
                   I understand, sir.  Nothing
                   like a bit on the side, eh?
                   Bit of fugitive flesh.  The
                   greatest aphrodisiac is a new
                   body, wouldn't you say, sir?

        Quail looks at him with distaste but is only anxious to
        be given the key to his room.  He says nothing.


30      INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail unlocks the door and enters.  No sooner does he
        relock the door then THE PHONE RINGS.  He freezes, stares
        at it for three rings, then picks it up.

                                 QUAIL
                           (into receiver)

        Quail is stunned.  He says nothing, but doesn't hang up.

30A     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        The man telephoning Quail is calling from a bar.  Occasion-
        ally people pass him on their way to the toilets.  He is
        youngish and conservatively dressed.  He speaks rapidly
        and urgently.

                   Take a wet towel and wrap it

                   deaden the signal.  It'll
                   take longer for them to

        Quail puts the phone down and rushes to the bathroom.


30B1    INT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT

        The earphone wearer and driver are moving in on the signal
        generated by Quail's bug.  Suddenly, the small illuminated
        cross on the dashboard map cuts out.

                                 EARPHONE WEARER
                   Shit!

30B2    INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail rushes back into the room with a wet towel,
        turban-like, wrapped around his head.  He rapidly picks
        up the phone.

                                 QUAIL

30C     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        The man on the phone looks around anxiously.

                   remember me.


30E     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        Scott Stevens hangs up the phone.  He looks around
        cautiously, then walks a few steps to the mens room.


30F     INT. MENS ROOM - NIGHT

        Scott Stevens walks to the row of troughs and begins to
        urinate.  The room is empty.  He hears a noise and looks
        around.  Two EIO men are standing there aiming lethal-looking
        high-velocity weapons at him.  One of them is the red-headed
        man we've already seen.

                                 1ST MAN (RED-HEADED)
                   Well, look at that.  He's
                   really got his hands full.

                                 2ND MAN
                   Not so full, so I've heard.

        Still urinating, the frustrated Scott Stevens can only look
        back over his shoulder.  Laughing, both men open fire,
        riddling him with bullets.  He collapses in an undignified
        heap, his head in the water at the base of the trough.


31      INT. "END OF THE LINE" CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Quail, with towel around his head, glances up and down the
        corridor -- spots a sign that says "FIRE EXIT".  He races
        towards it.


32      EXT. "END OF THE LINE" FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        The OV slams up in front of the hotel and a carload of
        MEN tear out of it and barge into the hotel.


32A     INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

        The startled clerk jumps to his feet as the group of
        armed men enter rapidly.

                                 EARPHONE WEARER
                   Quick.  The guy who checked
                   in fifteen minutes ago.

                                 CLERK
                           (nervous)
                   Room...thirty-six.

        Most of the armed men instantly head off up the stairs,
        their weapons at the ready.  Clerk watches, astonished.

                                 CLERK
                           (continuing)
                   He was only meeting a lady...
                   Aren't you guys overdoing it
                   a bit?


32B     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        Quail is walking along briskly, still with the towel
        around his head.  A few passers-by look at him curiously.
        He puts his hand together and greets them Indian-style.


33      EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON STREET SIGN

        which reads: "PARK AVENUE / 58TH STREET".

        PULL BACK to reveal "The Lucky Stub Pawnshop".  WINOS
        lurk on the corner.  Park Avenue has deteriorated into
        a slum.

        QUAIL ENTERS FRAME, and approaching the pawnshop, stepping
        over a BUM in a doorway.


34      INT. PAWNSHOP - NIGHT

        Quail is just entering; an old-fashioned BELL overhead,
        tripped by the door opening, announces his entrance.

        At once, an immense FAT MAN emerges from the back room.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                   You wanta camera?  I got some
                   good, top-quality ones.  You
                   want silk rugs?  Handmade last
                   century in Iran...all perfect.
                   You want videos?  Old movies...
                   classics...all those Vietnam
                   war ones...real quaint stuff...
                   you want...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting;
                            awkwardly)
                   I'm Hotchkiss...I came for
                   the...Grecian candlesticks...

        The Fat Man studies him warily for a long moment; then
        he disappears through the curtain.

        In a brief moment, he emerges again, carrying a small,
        "makeup-sized" case, as well as two large candelabra.

        The Pawnbroker puts the case on the counter.  Quail looks
        at the case with curiosity.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   I wonder if you could tell
                   me...

        They both look around as someone enters.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                   I trust these will look well
                   in you... mosque.


35      INT. FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON HANDS

        Opening up the small case.

        PULL BACK to reveal they are Quail's hands.  The hotel
        room he's now in is obviously a different one than the
        last one we saw him in.  The room is large but run-down,
        the walls are peeling, the architecture is much older,
        etc.

        Quail examines the contents of the case:  there are CREDIT
        CARDS and also MONEY, several stacks of bills, neatly
        tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of
        it red.


        CLOSE ON RED MONEY

        On the face of it is printed:  "MARS FEDERAL COLONY".

                                 QUAIL
                           (mutters)
                   Martian money....

        Quail thumbs through the money, and whistles softly to
        himself as he sees how much there is.

        Also in the case are:  TWO PASSPORTS;  a small CASSETTE
        RECORDER;  a rolled-up LEATHER POUCH and a spray can of
        some sort;  and a strange thing that looks like a silver
        mask.  He examines the face mask, studies BLACK LETTERS
        WRITTEN ACROSS IT (which we are not close enough to read)
        and then puts it aside.  Another item now catches  his
        eye:  a wristwatch.  He sees a conspicuous red button on
        the side of the watch, and PRESSES IT.  INSTANTLY, TO HIS
        SHOCK, QUAIL SEES A MAN MANIFEST HIMSELF HIMSELF OUT OF
        THIN AIR AND STAND THERE IN THE ROOM A FEW FEET AWAY FROM
        QUAIL:  he's an EXACT HOLOGRAPHIC DUPLICATE of Quail --
        down to the clothes Quail is wearing now.

        The image stands and watches Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What the hell...?

        Quail smiles, presses the red button again.  There is a
        HUMMING SOUND -- and the man FADES INTO THIN AIR -- like
        a television set being turned off.

        Quail looks bemused.

        Now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside.  There
        he finds what look like SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS;  a sponge,
        a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments
        and a tiny METAL HEAD on one end, and some tubes of salve.

        He turns on the cassette recorder.

        The VOICE he hears on the cassette TAPE is HIS OWN!

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                           (Quail's voice)
                   "Hauser, this is Hauser -- or
                   whatever you think your name
                   is now.  If you're listening
                   to this, I'm talking to myself.
                   Your memory's been erased and
                   you've got a wet towel around
                   your head.
                           (he does)
                   "The first thing you've got to
                   do is get rid of that bug in
                   your head."


36      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

        The sound of the tape continues as Quail follows
        instructions - pushing the wire up into a bloody portion
        of his neck, just below the ear.

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                   The monitoring device is
                   located in your left maxillary
                   sinus cavity.  Make a small
                   incision in your neck just
                   below the left ear, and
                   insert the wire up into the
                   sinus.  The head is
                   self-guiding.  Just shove.

        Quail makes a face.

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   You won't feel a thing.  The
                   spray cartridge contains a
                   local anesthetic and a blood
                   coagulant.  Careful, it's my
                   neck, too.

        Holding the wet towel against his neck, Quail slowly
        withdraws the wire.  On the end of it is a tiny, metal
        bead, the Transmitter.


37      INT. MOVING OFFICIAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        The man with the ear plug suddenly reacts.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   It's come on again.

                                 DRIVER
                   Where?

        The 1st man quickly check the map-grid in the dashboard.
        A small bright 'x' is flashing.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   He's in that old flophouse.
                   Plaza Hotel.  Central Park
                   South.


37A     INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Quail is anxious to get rid of the transmitter.  He looks
        around and notices a rat trap near a rat hole in the
        skirting board.

        He carefully - avoiding springing the trap - removes the
        piece of cheese and pushes the transmitter inside.  He
        then throws the cheese into the rat hole.


38      INT. MOVING OFFICIAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        The car is moving swiftly through the streets.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Boy, he's really moving
                   around.

        A CU of the screen shows the small 'x' moving in circles.


38A     EXT. HOTEL SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        The car pulls up.  Another follows it.  Armed men leap
        out from both.  The EARPLUG WEARER indicates they should
        go down an alley at the side of a service door.  They
        advance cautiously, guns at the ready.  They see no one.
        The EARPLUG WEARER indicates another, even narrower, alley
        leading off to one side.  Two of the men sneak cautiously
        up to it, their guns at the ready.

        A large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage
        bins.  Furious, they fire.  The bullets rip the bins to
        shreds, scattering refuse everywhere.  The rat is killed.
        They all stare in disbelief.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Ya dirty rat!


40      INT. E.I.O. HEADQUARTERS - MEMORY LAB - NIGHT

        OPENING CLOSE on a MONITOR SCREEN slated "HAUSER/QUAIL"
        followed by a serial number and some dates.  The slate
        vanishes, replaced by a scene of Quail -- undergoing
        some KIND OF MILITARY TRAINING.

        PAN to OTHER MONITORS, all depicting Quail in other
        action scenes -- on some kind of mission, driving a car,
        etc.

        TECHNICIANS man the monitors, scrolling through them in
        fast-forward and fast reverse as if searching files.

        The technicians turn as Cohaagen and his aides enter.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (demands)
                   Anything?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   We're running every one of
                   his memory tapes for the past
                   fifteen years.  Nothing yet,
                   sir.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   There must be something -- some
                   place he would go, some friend
                   he would run to.

        The red-haired E.I.O. man joins them.

                                 RED-HEADED MAN
                           (to Cohaagen;
                            quietly)
                   They lost him.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Again?!

        The red-headed man nods.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (continuing)
                   Are you sure the original
                   suppression took?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   Absolutely, sir.  He thinks
                   he's Quail, a computer...

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (interrupting)
                   Then how do you explain what
                   he's doing?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   Just his instincts.  He was
                   well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe
                   the memory cap's fractured.
                   Portions of his prior identity
                   could be leaking through.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (very anxious)
                   He'll remember Mars?  The
                   Sphinx Project?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   Fragments.  Nothing more.
                   Nothing he could piece together.
                   I did advise terminating him,
                   rather than implanting an
                   identify alternative.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   What do you think I am?  A
                   barbarian?  We're not living
                   in the twentieth century!

        He looks at the video screen again.  An image has flashed
        onto it of an attractive Eurasian girl.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (continuing)
                   Hold it there.

        He studies the picture, which changes to show the same
        girl from different angles.


42      INT. SPACE PORT - DAY

        Passengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.  In
        addition to the STEWARDESSES checking their tickets, there
        are two PLAINCLOTHES MEN checking every passenger.  They
        carry some kind of small, portable ELECTRONIC DEVICE that
        they shine in the face of each passenger going through.
        (It gives off a BLUE BEAM and HUMS.)

        The passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials,
        government people, etc.  There is also a large tour group
        consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly
        jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags.  They
        are being marshaled by an harassed TOUR ORGANIZER, who is
        carrying aloft a hand-painted sign... "MARTIAN TOUR GROUP".

        The last of the passengers board the spacecraft.  The
        chief PLAINCLOTHES MAN nods to an official and the door
        begins to close.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1
                   If he had to travel to Mars
                   with that bunch, I'd be sorry
                   for him.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #2
                   We couldn't have missed him?

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1
                   No way.  Let's get a coffee
                   before the next shuttle.


43      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT

        One of the PASSENGERS -- a middle-aged WOMAN - unbuckles
        her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her
        handbag, and some clothes on a hanger.


44      INT. LAVATORY - IN FLIGHT

        The woman locks the door and turns to the mirror.  She
        opens her bag, takes out a spray container, SPRAYS HER
        FACE with it, and takes out -- the SILVER FACE MASK we
        saw in Quail's emergency kit.

        She holds the mask to her face.  There is a SIZZLING
        NOISE, and SMOKE rises from behind the mask.

        She lowers the mask.  Her face is now that of QUAIL.
        He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute.

        He reaches inside his dress, starts to REMOVE his "FALSIES."

        CLOSE ON MASK

        We can read the BLACK LETTERING written across it now:
        "LASER FACIAL".


45      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT

        Quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the
        ebullient tour crowd.  He turns and looks in the other
        direction and sees a video theater advertising "ROCKY 36"
        with Sylvester Stallone III, Jnr.  He isn't too excited,
        but heads towards it.  He pauses a little when an
        announcement comes over the intercom.

        A LITTLE BELL sounds, followed by INTERCOM STATIC.  Quail
        looks up.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll
                   glance out the starboard
                   viewports, you'll behold an
                   indeed awesome sight --

        Quail goes to a viewport and PEERS, transfixed.  He is
        seeing... at last... the object of his obsession.


46      EXT. SPACELINER - IN ORBIT AROUND MARS

        The SPACELINER -- which we have deliberately not seen before
        this moment for dramatic effect -- banks and turns, suddenly
        bringing into view -- MARS.

        AN IMMENSE ORANGE GLOBE -- so close it looks like it's
        going to fall on us.  It dwarfs the spaceliner.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   Those long gorges you see,
                   clearly are the legendary
                   canals of Mars....

        The liner drops toward the surface of Mars.  Below:  a
        NETWORK OF INTERSECTING LINES crisscross the planet.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   Of course, they are not manmade
                   canals, but vast natural chasms
                   ...many deeper and larger than
                   the Grand Canyon.  Though
                   utterly without moisture now,
                   scientists have determined
                   that they were formed by
                   massive flooding millions of
                   years ago.


47      INT. SPACELINER

        Quail stares, his brow furrowing as if with some deep
        hidden memory he can't quite recall.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   Surface temperatures at the
                   Martian equator is minus
                   one-hundred and twenty degrees 
                   Centigrade -- in winter.
                   Fortunately, this time of year
                   it's slightly more seasonable:
                   Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit,
                   outside the domes.
                           (beat)
                   Please remember, folks, that
                   outside the domes you'll need
                   to carry your own personal
                   oxygen supply at all times.
                   The atmosphere of Mars is
                   almost a vacuum.  Thank you
                   for flying with Interstellar
                   and we hope your stay will be
                   a pleasant one.


48      EXT. MARS - OUTER SPACE

        CAMERA follows the spaceliner until the ENTIRE FRAME is
        filled with the RED-ORANGE sands of MARS.


49      EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

        An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under
        a red-orange sky.

        The desert is cut by a ROAD, which snakes across the
        rocky terrain.  Some surface TRAFFIC moves along the
        road (all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere
        of Mars is almost a pure vacuum) - including the
        MARSPORT BUS.

        PAN WITH THE BUS - TO REVEAL

        A CITY UNDER A DOME.

        In the midst of the stark, trackless landscape -- it's
        midday, scorching -- rises a huge weatherbeaten GEODESIC
        STRUCTURE, its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage.
        Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood
        rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with
        a tough town carved out of the wilderness.


50      INT. MARSPORT - DAY

        Quail is looking out at the desolate landscape.  The TOUR
        ORGANISER, an amiable middle-aged man sits beside him.
        It is possible he is not a married man.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's no Garden of Eden.

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                   No.  Quite a bit to see, though.
                   The canyons, the old Sphinx...

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you know about that?

                                 TOUR ORANISER
                   Not much, really.  Millions
                   of years old.  Bit like the
                   one that used to be in Egypt,
                   you know...

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah.  Got destroyed in the
                   Arab wars... What about this
                   independence movement?

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                           (dismissive)
                   Not worth worrying about.
                   Mostly descendants of the
                   original colonists from Earth.
                   Now they want self-rule so they
                   can sell us all the minerals...
                   I don't think we've met.  You
                   with our group?  Takes me a
                   while to know everyone.

                                 QUAIL
                   Sure.  Douglas Quail.

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                   Richard Toltz.
                           (they shake hands)
                   Well, Doug, I hope we'll see
                   a lot more of each other.


55      EXT. CITY (UNDER THE DOOM) - DAY

        The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel.  The
        buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised,
        temporary look.  Most are pre-fabricated structures.
        The streets are crowded and there is a "frontier-town"
        atmosphere.  Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water
        and air containers.

        A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and
        emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the
        dome.

        Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around
        before going inside the hotel.  Suddenly, one of them throws
        a small sack at him.  It hits his chest and leaves a yellow
        stain.  The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....

                                 BOY
                   Smogpsucker!

        From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with
        a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC
        SONG.

                                 DOORMAN
                   You know how it is, sir.  Some
                   of these red-asses are a bit
                   prejudiced.

                                 QUAIL
                   Prejudiced?  Against what?

                                 DOORMAN
                   Earthmen.

        The street song has swelled, adult MINERS and CITIZENS
        joining the belligerent chorus.

                                 QUAIL
                   What are they singing?

                                 DOORMAN
                   The Martian National Anthem.

        Quail tips the doorman, enter the hotel.


57      INT. MARS HILTON LOBBY - DAY

        Quail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency
        exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand.  A SHOESHINE
        BOY looks up at Quail.

        Quail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium
        entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the
        dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in
        spotless linen fill the lobby.

        Quail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on
        a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model
        of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written "THE FIRST WONDER
        OF MARS".  A recorded VOICE repeats a canned speech --

                                 CANNED VOICE
                   "...the Martian Sphinx...
                   only evidence of non-human
                   civilization ever discovered
                   ...age estimated at over
                   eighteen million years...


        CLOSE - SHOESHINE BOY

        He stares at Quail.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Quail approaches the Registration Desk.

                                 CLERK
                   Nice to have you back with us,
                   Mr. Hauser.

        Quail is startled to be recognized -- particularly by
        this name.  He tries to stay casual.

                                 QUAIL
                   Nice to be back.
                           (pick up pen)
                   I'm flattered you remember me.

                                 CLERK
                   Part of my job, sir.

                                 QUAIL
                           (starts to sign;
                            hesitates)
                   Do you remember my first name,
                   too?

                                 CLERK
                   Charles.  Charles Hauser, right?

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm impressed.
                           (now he signs)
                   Listen.  I need transportation
                   to the... uh... the Sphinx.
                   Can you arrange it for me?

                                 CLERK
                   I'm sorry, sir.  But Earth
                   government has sealed off the
                   excavation site completely.
                   No one but survey teams and
                   archaeologists are allowed
                   closer than twenty miles.

        The Clerk taps a few keys on a computer.

                                 CLERK
                   Oh...
                           (spots something
                            on the computer)
                   Do you want the item you left
                   with us?

                                 QUAIL
                   What item?  Oh... yes, please.

        The Clerk turns to the safe, retrieves an envelope. He
        hands it -- and an ELECTRONIC ROOM KEY -- to Quail.


58      P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE SPHINX

        Far in the distance, a dusty red structure squats amid
        barren dunes.  We see vehicles, scaffolding, a fortified
        perimeter.


59      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

        Quail stands at the window, looking through binoculars.
        He lowers them irritably, tosses them on the bed.

        Quail tugs the envelope from his pocket, tears it open.
        Inside is a single slip of paper, on which is written
        in longhand:

                                 "MELINA NOEL
                           Last Chance Air Station
                        Kilometer 61   Gird Square T9"


60      EXT. MARS HILTON - SUNSET

        It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly
        beauty.  The sun is bold and blood red;  the foggy, drip-
        ping glass of the Dome tints the light into strange colors.

        Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a
        white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand.

        Behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the Shoeshine
        Boy.  He keeps out of sight -- but is definitely tailing
        Quail.

        As Quail nears the first solar-powered taxi in line, he is
        approached by an amiable-looking CALYPSO GUY wearing a West
        Indian shirt and bright straw hat.

                                 CALYPSO GUY (BENNIE)
                   Need a cab, boss mon?

        Quail hesitates, unsure of the protocol.

                                 BENNIE
                           (continuing)
                   Mine's right around the corner.

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicating first
                            cab in line)
                   That one's closer.

                                 BENNIE
                   But I out-hustle him, right?

                                 QUAIL
                           (smiling)
                   Right.

        TWO CABBIES exchange curses as Quail, wary, follows the
        Calypso Guy around a corner, climbs into the small solar
        car.


62      EXT. CITY DOME - AIR LOCK - SUNSET

        An AIR LOCK whooshes open underneath a Checker Cab sign.
        Bennie and Quail emerge in the solar-powered car -- set
        off into the desert.


63      EXT. DESERT - SUNSET

        The taxi traverses the same type desert that Quail crossed
        a few hours ago.  Only now is looks completely different.
        The late light tints everything in pastel shades, Quail is
        awed by the grandeur of the Lawrence-of-Arabia-like setting.


68      EXT. DESERT TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

        Quail and Bennie's taxi approaches a brightly-lit oasis in
        the middle of the desert.  There's a cafe, repair facilities
        and a huge parking lot -- all under a garish neon sign:
        "LAST CHANCE AIR STATION AND ASLOON - EAT HERE AND GET GAS".

        Quail and Bennie's taxi pulls in and parks.  In the lot is
        a collection of strange and colorful vehicles:  huge ore
        trucks that pull eight trailers, mountain prospecting jeeps,
        Grapes-of-Wrath jalopies.  Quail and Bennie disembark, wear-
        ing breathing masks, and enter the main building.


69      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION - NIGHT

        The joint is a combination saloon/cathouse/casino.  There
        are slot machines, HOOKERS, MINERS and HOMESTEADERS; it is
        like a Nevada brothel -- packed with wild and woolly indi-
        vidualists, the equivalent of Old West trappers, prospectors
        and cowboys -- but with a space-age look.

        Quail and Bennie elbow their way to the bar.  Fragments of
        conversation are overheard.

                                 MINER #1
                   ...if that intergalactic little
                   Napoleon thinks I'm sellin' and
                   clearin' outta here, he can
                   think again!

                                 MINER #2
                           (with a laugh)
                   ...watcha gonna do when he cuts
                   off the air, Luke?

                                 MINER #3
                   ...you'll be breathin' red dust
                   and shittin' bricks.

        Bennie and Quail pass another group.

                                 MINER #4
                   ...my wife ain't goin' on
                   one of those space shuttles...
                   she hates flyin'...

                                 MINER #5
                   ...aw, come on... flyin's
                   safer'n crossin' the road...

                                 MINER #6
                   ...yeah, there ain't been a
                   real disaster since that
                   collision off Phobos, nigh on
                   twenty years ago...

                                 MINER #4
                           (alarmed)
                   ...well, that killed twelve
                   thousand...

                                 QUAIL
                   What is this, Bennie...
                   Tombstone?

                                 BENNIE
                   Sorta.  Bunch of miners out
                   here got their own claims, from
                   way back.  Cohaagen's buyin' em
                   all up, says he's gonna cut off
                   the air an' water if they won't
                   sell...

        Quail attracts the attention of the BARTENDER.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm looking for Melina Noel.

                                 BARTENDER
                   You've found her.

        His nod indicates an area behind Quail.  He turns to see
        an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables.  She
        doesn't notice Quail.  He walks toward her through the
        crowd.  Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away.

        MELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into
        Quail.  She stops, obviously astonished to see him.

                                 MELINA
                   You bastard!

        Almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a
        billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by
        swinging doors.

        There are no occupants and it is almost in darkness.  Quail,
        bewildered, follows her.  Inside the billiard room he turns
        on the lights which illuminates the area of the table.

        (NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the
                outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.)

        Melina is still fighting back tears.  Quail stops in front
        of her, unsure about what to do.  He has no recollection
        of how well he might have known this woman.

        Suddenly, she slaps him hard across the face.

                                 MELINA
                           (quietly)
                   You bastard...

        He rubs his painful cheek. 

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   That's new -- the innocent
                   look.
                           (bitter sarcasm)
                   You didn't have that one
                   before.
                           (beat)
                   Well?

        Quail is speechless.

                                 QUAIL
                   Well, uh... I...

                                 MELINA
                   All right, I'll say it for
                   you.

        He looks relieved (but tries to cover).

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   Don't worry.  I got the note.
                   You discharged your obligation.

                                 QUAIL
                   What note?

                                 MELINA
                   Oh, the usual one.  "Must
                   return immediately to Earth...
                   the wife needs me..."

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't have a wife.  Well,
                   I do - but not a real wife.
                           (getting
                            desperate)
                   Hell... look... someone else
                   sent that note.  Someone who --

                                 MELINA
                   What are you here for?!

                                 QUAIL
                   For you!  I don't even know
                   why --

        Melina bursts into tears.  Quail rather tentatively puts
        his arms around her.  She welcomes this at first, but then
        pushes him away.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Whoever I was, I must have
                   been a helluva guy.

                                 MELINA
                   "Whoever you were"???

                                 QUAIL
                   Listen.  I've for to tell  you
                   something.  I beg you to
                   believe me... help me --

        All Melina's suspicions come rushing back.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Something happened to my mind.
                   Memory suppression, false
                   implant, I don't know
                   what --

        Melina backs off.  Quail grows more desperate.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What I'm saying is... I don't
                   remember you.  I don't remember
                   us.  I don't remember me --

        Melina's expression grows dead hard.

                                 MELINA
                   [And I thought...]

                                 QUAIL
                   Who is us?

                                 MELINA
                           (ignoring the
                            question)
                   Memory erasure is what they
                   use on agents.  Go away.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wait... I was an agent -- I'm
                   not now -- just tell me who
                   I am!  How did we know each
                   other?  Why are they trying
                   to kill me?!

        He takes a step toward her, nearly frantic.

                                 MELINA
                   I'm not trusting you again.

                                 QUAIL
                   You loved me once, you must
                   have --

                                 MELINA
                   That you was a liar.  Who you
                   are now I don't even know.

                                 QUAIL
                   Please, Melina --

                                 MELINA
                           (tears starting)
                   Get out!

                                 QUAIL
                   I need your help --

                                 MELINA
                           (crying quietly)
                   Get out!  Get the hell away
                   from me!

        Quail gives up; goes through the doors and leaves.  Melina
        slumps her shoulder against the table and cries.


77      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

        Quail enters from the cafe.  Bennie is kneeling beside his
        taxi, repairing a tire.  He look up, sees Quail approach.

        On his right hand, Bennie has a mechanical device
        capable of spinning 360 degrees.  He uses it to twirl
        a lug nut tight on his tire.  As Quail approaches,
        Bennie removes the TOOL ATTACHMENT from his HAND,
        tosses it into a kit beside the taxi.

                                 BENNIE
                   You don't look so good, boss.
                   All over the Universe, women
                   is an awful curse.

        He opens the door for Quail, beams.


80      INT. SOLAR-POWERED CAR - NIGHT - MOVING - DESERT BACKGROUND

        Quail still broods, Bennie tries to cheer him up.

                                 BENNIE
                   It's a tough planet, boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah, right.

                                 BENNIE
                   Some guy really screwed her -
                   screwed her up real good.
                   Some Earthman.  Just hopped
                   on a space shuttle.

        Bennie bright tone isn't improving Quail's mood.

                                 QUAIL
                   Listen, Bennie.  You're pretty
                   well informed?

                                 BENNIE
                   If that means I know it all,
                   you're right, boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you know about the
                   Sphinx?

                                 BENNIE
                   I don't know nothin'.  Not
                   about the Sphinx.  That's out
                   of the ball park.

                                 QUAIL
                   I have to get there.  Can't
                   you help me?

                                 BENNIE
                   No can do, mon.  You want
                   women, cigarettes, red-market
                   money, booze, even air or
                   water... Bennie's your man.
                   But the Sphinx... that's
                   E.I.O. --


80A     INT. CITY UNDER THE DOME - NIGHT

        The solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly
        SIRENS approach on a cross street.  Bennie brakes and stops.
        He and Quail watch as POLICE MOTORCYCLES clear a path for a
        huge, GAS-POWERED LIMO.  MINERS on the sidewalks shout
        CURSES, OBSCENITIES --

                                 BENNIE
                   Well... look at that one, eh?

                                 QUAIL
                   What?

                                 BENNIE
                   Big cheese in town.  Big
                   smelly cheese.

                                 QUAIL
                   Cohaagen?  But isn't he often
                   here?

                                 BENNIE
                   No way.  That cat just cheat
                   the Martian workers without
                   ever leavin' his place in
                   Beverly Hills.  Somethin' must
                   be cookin'.

        Quail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with
        curiosity as he passes.  Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a
        street lamp.  His face makes an impression on Quail, who
        perhaps faintly remembers him in the past.


82      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door.  He
        checks all the rooms.  Then he crosses to the dresser,
        studies himself in the mirror.  He looks haggard.

        Quail opens a drawer, takes out his "emergency case," sets
        it on top and opens it.  He removes a shoulder holster and
        pistol, sets them aside.  He takes out a tape recorder.

        He sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in
        there were contained the answers to all his questions.
        He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at
        the door.

        Quail freezes.  Another KNOCK.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                           (through door)
                   Mr. Hauser...

                                 QUAIL
                   Who is it?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to
                   you... about Douglas Quail.

        Quail ditches the recorder and the "emergency case" into
        the drawer -- everything except the PISTOL.

        Quail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side --
        out of the line of fire).

                                 QUAIL
                           (tensely)
                   Who are you?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   My name is George Edgemar.
                   I work for Rekall, Incorporated.

                                 QUAIL
                           (stunned;
                            incredulous)
                   Rekall??

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Yes.  It's difficult to
                   explain... Could you open the
                   door, please?  I'm not armed.

        Quail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out
        of view of the person at the door.

        A dignified-looking GENTLEMAN stands there, calm and
        pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come
                   in?  I won't be offended if
                   you prefer to keep the gun
                   you're holding trained on me.

        He can't see the gun, but somehow knows.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right... come in.

        Quail does keep his gun trained on the man.  The man enters,
        holding in his outstretched hand -- a business card.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   My card, Mr. Quail.

        Quail frisks him, then takes the card, glances at it.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay -- so you're Doctor
                   George Edgemar of 'Rekall,
                   Inc.'  So?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   As I said... this is going to
                   be very difficult -- for both
                   of us.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm listening.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're
                   not really standing here at
                   this moment.

                                 QUAIL
                   Sat that again.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I said, you're not really
                   here.  Neither am I.  We're
                   both in the Memory Studio --
                   in the offices of Rekall, Inc.
                   On Earth.

        Long pause.

                                 QUAIL
                   Are you trying to tell me that
                   this is all part of some...
                   artificially injected fantasy?
                   That I never really left Earth?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   No, not quite.  We didn't give
                   you this.  You're creating it
                   yourself --
                           (pauses, choosing
                            his words)
                   Remember the option we offered
                   you?  Intelligence agent?
                   Something inside you liked
                   that idea, fastened on it.
                   What you're experiencing now
                   is a free-form delusion that
                   you yourself are fabricating.

                                 QUAIL
                   What is this shit you're
                   giving me?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail.
                   It's the truth.
                           (beat)
                   I know it's very hard for you
                   to accept, but you're having
                   a schizophrenic reaction...
                   we can't snap you out of the
                   Narkadine.  You're in a world
                   of your own fantasy.

                                 QUAIL
                   Then how the hell can you be
                   in my dream -- if you know it's
                   just a dream?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I've been artificially
                   implanted -- like the first
                   part of your fantasy.  I'm
                   actually monitoring your dream
                   at a psychoprobe console.
                   This is a last resort.  When
                   somebody gets stuck in their
                   own fantasy, we send in
                   someone after them.  A
                   specialist, like myself.

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't believe a word you're
                   saying.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I was afraid you'd think that.
                   I'm sorry to have to do this,
                   but you really are stuck.
                           (calls out)
                   Doctor Noel, would you come in
                   now please?

        The door starts to open.  Quail pivots and points his
        gun at the opening door.

        MELINA walks in, carrying a CLIPBOARD.  She looks at Quail
        with professional detachment.

                                 MELINA
                   Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid
                   it's all true.

        Quail is staggered.

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   I tried to break through to
                   you earlier, but you just
                   molded me into your fantasy.
                   Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar
                   to get through to a client as
                   tough as you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (wavering)
                   So what's supposed to happen
                   now?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Just do exactly as we tell
                   you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (stares at him
                            coldly)
                   Somehow that doesn't appeal
                   to me.

                                 MELINA
                   Please, Mr. Quail... try to
                   cooperate.  You're having a
                   schizophrenic embolism.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   If we can't get you out now...
                   you may never come out of it.
                   Your wife calls every day --


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Even more suspicious.


        TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

                                 QUAIL
                   If this is a fantasy, there'll
                   be no real consequences when
                   I pull this trigger.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   But there will by consequences
                   inside your mind.  Consequences
                   that won't hurt me... but could
                   be fatal to you.
                           (beat)
                   If you shoot me, you'll wipe
                   me out of your fantasy -- I
                   can't come back again.  Because
                   to you, I'll be dead.  I can't
                   help you get back to reality.
                   You'll be stuck in permanent
                   psychosis.


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Trembling, holding the gun point blank in Edgemar's face.


        CLOSE - EDGEMAR

        Showing no fear of tension whatever.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   You're going to lower the gun,
                   Mr. Quail.  You're going to
                   hand it to me --


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Straining desperately to find the true "reality."


        EXTREME CLOSEUP - TRIGGER OF GUN

        Quail's finger on it.


        TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

                                 EDGEMAR
                   You're going to do exactly
                   what I tell you --

        Quail PULLS THE TRIGGER!


        REVERSE ANGLE - BACK OF EDGEMAR'S HEAD

        We SEE the results of the gunshot from this angle only,
        and so BRIEFLY as to produce an almost SUBLIMINAL effect:
        the back of Edgemar's head blows off --

        He collapses to the floor.

        Melina LEAPS at Edgemar's falling form and CLAMPS HER HANDS
        over Edgemar's RIGHT HAND!

                                 MELINA
                   Watch out, Charles!  There's
                   more of them in the hall!

        Quail spins toward the door just as it BURSTS OPEN.  A man
        enters, firing, but Quail has fallen to the floor and
        returns the fire.  He staggers back out into the corridor
        and slams against the wall, dead.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                           (from hall)
                   You've had it, Hauser!  Throw
                   out your weapon if you want
                   a past!

        Melina is still crouched by Edgemar's body, holding his
        HAND for some reason.  Her CLIPBOARD dangles by her side.

                                 MELINA
                           (whispering)
                   There's an explosive in the
                   clipboard!  He has a dead-man
                   switch in his hand!

        Squeezing Edgemar's hand shut with one of hers, she holds
        up her other wrist -- to show that the CLIPBOARD IS BOUND
        TO HER WRIST BY A CHAIN!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   What do you say, Hauser?  We
                   haven't got all night!  Hauser?

        Quail (Hauser) SHOOTS OFF the chain.

                                 QUAIL
                   What happens it I come out?

        Quail takes the CLIPBOARD from Melina and eases himself to
        the side of the doorway.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   We'll put in a word with the
                   big boys.  Maybe you'll just
                   get exile to Venus.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right.  Here comes the
                   weapon.

        Quail reaches around the corner and SAILS THE CLIPBOARD into
        the hallway.  Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand --

        There is a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION in the hallway,


83      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Quail comes out in crouch, ready to shoot.  On the floor
        lies a DEAD MAN and the body of the Shoeshine Boy, sprawled
        grotesquely.  The hallway is filled with smoke.  The floor
        covered with debris.  Plaster falling from the ceiling.

        All over the hotel, ALARMS begin BLARING.


84      INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail strides back in, icy-furious.  He seizes Melina by
        the wrist and drags her after him into the corridor.


84A     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Two more E.I.O. men appear but Quail shoots them while
        dragging Melina down the hall in the opposite direction.
        He pushes open the door leading to the staircase.


84B     INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina run down the stairs.  On the next landing
        is a service elevator, from which a waiter is emerging
        carefully carrying a tray with hors d'oeuvres and champagne.

                                 QUAIL
                   Back in, quick!

                                 WAITER
                   Wouldn't you prefer your order
                   in your room, sir?

                                 QUAIL
                   In!

        Quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the
        elevator.


84C     INT. LIFT - NIGHT

        Quail presses the basement button.  As he talks to Melina
        he opens the champagne and pours two glasses.  The waiter
        is too frightened to protest.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay.  Answers!  Now!

                                 MELINA
                   They kidnapped me.  Said
                   they'd kill you if I didn't
                   cooperate.  I told them I
                   didn't care, but then when
                   I realized they meant it...

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't know why they're
                   after me, but what's your
                   connection with all this?

                                 MELINA
                   We were together before.

                                 QUAIL
                   Believe me, I'm really sorry
                   I can't recall the details
                   of that encounter.

        The elevator has reached the basement.  They rush out.


85      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HILTON - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina run from a basement door into an alley.

        A solar car whips out in front of them.  Quail and Melina
        leap aboard.

                                 MELINA
                   Go, Bennie, for God's sake!


86      INT. BENNIE'S SOLAR CAR - NIGHT

        Bennie weaves as fast as he can in and out of the traffic,
        Quail and Melina ducking out of view in the passenger seat.

                                 BENNIE
                           (glances in
                            mirror)
                   Bad news, boss lady.

                                 MELINA
                   What?

                                 BENNIE
                   Black cruiser just pull out
                   behind us.


86A     EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

        A large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way
        through the crowds and traffic behind them.


86B     INT. BENNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

        Quail is aiming his gun at the following car.

                                 BENNIE
                   Forget the shooter, boss.  I
                   lose 'em for you.

                                 QUAIL
                   Lose them?  In this?

                                 BENNIE
                   Hang on!

        Bennie reaches down, grasps a KNOB.  He yanks it, like
        someone starting an outboard motor -- and an ear-splitting
        LOUD ENGINE roars to life.

        Bennie opens the throttle and the solar car HURTLES DOWN
        THE STREET.  Quail and Melina are thrown back in the seat.


87      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        GUNFIRE blazes all around the car.  Quail FIRES back at
        the pursuing car.

                                 QUAIL
                           (shouts over
                            GUNFIRE)
                   You're gonna get a ticket
                   for that engine, Bennie --

                                 BENNIE
                   Yutani 650 -- you like it,
                   boss?  Nothing like the old
                   gas when you want a bit of
                   speed.

        BULLETS from the cruiser rip through the car.

                                 MELINA
                   You better have two aces,
                   Bennie.
                           (glances behind)
                   There's a second cruiser --
                   and it's gaining --


87A     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

        Bennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official
        car gaining on it.  Bennie takes a corner sharply near a
        huge water selling stand.  The official car brakes to make
        the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand.  The
        water container tips and empties water through the open
        roof (i.e. through which one of the Agents has been firing)
        so that the car completely fills.  The driver continues the
        chase, but the occupants are now submerged.  They frantic-
        ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's
        car.


88      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

        The solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end
        street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of
        the windows) in pursuit.

        At the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but
        continues going into a large opening.  It is an abandoned
        mine.  The bigger car follows him, but won't fit.  The
        roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into
        the narrow opening.

        The second official car pulls up behind.  A chauffeur jumps
        out and opens the rear door.  Cohaagen steps out.  He sur-
        veys the scene.  The four men in the wrecked car clamber
        their way backwards out of the wreckage.  They are covered
        in blood and their clothes are in shreds.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   I take it, then, you've failed
                   to get him again.

        Cohaagen turns to an associate, EMILE, a youngish,
        well-dressed executive type.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (continuing)
                   Proceed with Operation Sphinx.

                                 EMILE
                   But, sir...

                                 COHAAGEN
                   With him...
                           (gestures toward
                            the mine)
                   ...on the lose, I'm not
                   taking any more chances.
                   Operation Sphinx will flush
                   him out.



93      INT. OLD MINE - NIGHT

        The solar car proceeds along the tunnel.  It enters an area
        full of smoke.  Dozens of men are sitting around smoking
        cigarettes, pipes and cigars.  Quail looks at them in
        amazement.

                                 QUAIL
                   What's all this?

                                 BENNIE
                   Nothin', boss.  Just old
                   smokies.  Only place they
                   can come for a puff.  It's
                   all banned topside.

        They have now climbed out of the car.  Quail looks
        searchingly at Melina and Bennie.

                                 QUAIL
                   So you two are into something
                   a bit more serious than the
                   taxi and truck-stop business.

                                 BENNIE
                   That's right, boss.

        He unzips his jacket to reveal a T-shirt with "MARTIAN
        LIBERATION FRONT" (and an appropriate symbol) emblazoned
        on it.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!... T-shirts.  They
                   died out on Earth years ago.

                                 BENNIE
                           (hurt)
                   Well, maybe we ain't fashion
                   leaders, boss.

                                 MELINA
                   No.  But we still believe in
                   a free Mars.

        They walk as they talk - into a room off the main tunnel.
        It is adorned with "FREE MARS" and "MARTIAN LIBERATION
        FRONT" posters.  A group of people are printing T-shirts
        and leaflets.  They exchange greetings with Melina and
        Bennie.

                                 QUAIL
                   So where did I fit into all
                   this?

                                 MELINA
                   You - when you were Charles
                   Hauser with E.I.O -
                   infiltrated our group.  I
                   guess Cohaagen didn't trust
                   you any more when you and
                   I...

        Her gesture suggests their liaison.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah.  And I can't even
                   remember it.  We'll have to
                   arrange a return bout.

                                 MELINA
                   ...so he had your memory
                   wiped and fixed you up with
                   a new identity.

                                 QUAIL
                   But - the Sphinx.  Why is
                   that stuck in my mind?  Why's
                   it so important?

                                 MELINA
                   I don't know.

                                 BENNIE
                   Just an ole heap o' stone,
                   boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's more than that, Bennie,
                   I know it's more.  Somehow
                   it's connected.

        He slumps into a chair with frustration.

                                 MELINA
                           (reflecting)
                   Maybe there's a way  you can
                   get your memory back.

                                 QUAIL
                   How?  What?  Where?  When?

                                 MELINA
                   A bit of Martian Wisdom.
                   We're not all stupid
                   colonists.


99      EXT. CITY - NIGHT

        Bennie, Quail and Melina are walking in a crowded area
        of town.  Water sellers and food stalls are everywhere.
        An ARMORED LOUDSPEAKER VEHICLE appears, broadcasting to
        the crowd.  It is also swinging a powerful searchlight
        along the footpaths and streets.

                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER
                   ...all residents are to
                   report to their nearest
                   space-travel agent within
                   twelve hours, all residents
                   will be departing on shuttles
                   within twenty-four hours.  Air
                   and water supplies will be cut
                   off at that time.  I repeat...

                                 MELINA
                   He's doing it!

                                 QUAIL
                   What?  Why?

                                 MELINA
                   Clearing everyone out!  It's
                   been rumored for months...

        The searchlight approaches Bennie, Quail and Melina.  Bennie
        ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses
        her passionately.  The light sees only the back of his head.
        She responds warmly to his kiss.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wow.  I can see why I was
                   willing to betray E.I.O.

                                 MELINA
                   I though you believed in
                   our cause?

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes.  Of course.  That, too.

        They move into the crowd.  The message on the
        loudspeaker is repeated.


101     INT. KUATO'S SANCTUARY - NIGHT

        The interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its
        ghetto exterior.  The decor is a baroque combination of
        Middle Eastern opulence and 21st century flash.  It looks
        like something out of "The Arabian Nights".

        A man enters from another room.  Although the man's features
        are East Indian, he is very much a Peter Lorre type;  he
        wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl
        draped around the back of his neck.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                           (nodding to
                            Quail)
                   Your servant, Fahreem Kuato.
                   I greet you by the
                   twenty-seven names that still
                   remain, praying that you cast
                   jewels into the darkness and
                   given them to glow with the
                   colors of life.

        As Kuato speaks, Quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce,
        to Melina.

                                 QUAIL
                   What use is this weirdo?

                                 MELINA
                   Ssssh...there are skills on
                   mars that Earth has forgotten.

                                 KUATO
                   No need to introduce yourself,
                   Mr. Quail.
                           (smiles at Quail's
                            surprise)
                   Tolerate my presumption, but
                   it does not tax my powers to
                   know that you are the most
                   sought-after man on two
                   worlds.

        From the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information
        about Quail and Co. can be heard.  Searchlight beams
        occasionally sweep past the windows.

                                 KUATO
                           (continuing)
                   This way, my dear man.  We
                   have much to accomplish --
                           (ominously)
                   -- and very little time.


102     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT

        A Bysantine salon filled with enormous Oriental pillows.

        (NOTE:  In the scenes inside Kuato's sanctum, the loudspeaker
                vans in the outside streets can be heard from time to
                to time.  They are repeating the evacuation message
                from scene 99, but alternating it with a call for the
                apprehension of Quail and Melina...

                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER
                   ...for information leading to
                   these arrests, first-class
                   travel to Earth will be
                   provided plus a weekend at
                   the Leningrad Disneyworld,
                   all expenses paid.  I repeat,
                   an Oriental girl and Earthman,
                   possibly to be found in the
                   company of a black taxi driver.
                   These are dangerous subversives
                   and sworn enemies of the
                   glorious Peoples Republic of
                   Mars...)

                                 KUATO
                   The turbulence you hear
                   outside is but a reflection
                   of the turmoil within you.
                   You have brought it to Mars
                   in your search for yourself.

        Kuato takes a seat on the pillows, invites the others to
        join him.  Quail hesitates.

                                 QUAIL
                   And you're going to help me
                   by reading my mind?

                                 KUATO
                   Indubitably.  There is only
                   small matter of a fee.

        THREE RESPONSES COME TOGETHER.

                                 QUAIL
                   A fee!

                                 KAUTO
                   Naturally.

                                 MELINA
                   This is for our cause!

                                 KUATO
                           (soothingly)
                   Income before ideals.  Shall
                   we say five-hundred-thousand
                   dollars?

                                 QUAIL
                           (appalled)
                   Five-hundred-thousand Martian
                   dollars, that's...
                           (think,
                            calculating the
                            exchange rate)

                                 KUATO
                   Not Martian dollars, Mr.
                   Quail - Earth dollars.

                                 MELINA
                   That's interplanetary robbery!

                                 QUAIL
                   With today's exchange rate...
                   that's over two million
                   Martian dollars!

                                 KUATO
                           (suave)
                   What price do you put, Mr.
                   Quail, on the future of the
                   solar system?

                                 BENNIE
                   Aw, come off it, man.  Just
                   for a bit of mumbo-jumbo
                   with a crystal ball.

                                 KUATO
                           (his manner
                            slipping)
                   Listen, buster, we're talking
                   heavy stuff here.  You try
                   and work out what's with this
                   guy!

        He jerks his thumb toward Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay!  Okay!  I'll pay it,
                   but the Interstellar Trade
                   Practices Commission might
                   be interested in this.

        Everyone calms down.

        Kuato smiles.  He extinguishes all the lights save one
        small blue one, which illuminates the room eerily, like
        a seance.

                                 KUATO
                   Retrieving the past is like
                   walking backwards along a
                   perilous road.  The
                   half-recalled, the
                   half-forgotten, the repressed,
                   the fantasies, the triumphs,
                   joys, failures, betrayals...

        He closes his eyes and concentrates.

                                 KUATO
                           (continuing)
                   Yes... I can feel it... a
                   wall.  Erasure techniques are
                   so brutal.
                           (frowns; scans
                            harder)
                   Blocks.  Side channels.
                   Future and past all jumbled.
                   I shall have to enter deep
                   trance to break through.
                           (rising)
                   I will be scanning you through
                   the Oracle Head.

        Kauto turns around and sits down with back toward Quail.
        He reaches up and lowers his cowl, REVEALING:

        A TINY LITTLE HEAD GROWING OUT OF THE BACK OF HIS NECK!

        The head's eyes are closed in sleep.  It is utterly hairless
        and looks like one of those dolls made from dried apples; a
        shriveled, ancient-looking yellow little ball.

        The LITTLE FACE TWITCHED, YAWNS and OPENS ITS EYES, BLINKS.
        It looks at Melina, then at Quail.

        It opens its toothless little mouth and SPEAKS.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                   Do not fear me.  I need your
                   openness...

        ZOOM IN ON QUAIL'S EYES.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (continuing)
                   Open you thoughts to my
                   presence...

        CONTINUE ZOOM UNTIL ENTIRE FRAME is filled by QUAIL'S EYE.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (continuing)
                   Open...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


        BLACKNESS BROKEN BY PULSES OF WHITE LIGHT

        The alternations between dark (ACTION) and white (LIGHT)
        are RHYTHMICAL so as to create a hypnotic, dream-like
        feeling.


103     WHITE LIGHT

        Fades to reveal a dramatic CLOSE UP of the SPHINX.  We see
        its face, shoulders and behind it the red Martian sky --


103A    PULL BACK

        to reveal the Sphinx is a PROJECTION on a screen in a
        windowless briefing room.  Quail is seated across from
        Cohaagen and other SENIOR E.I.O. OFFICERS.  On the walls
        are numerous satellite photos, recon maps and excavation
        drawings -- all relating to the Sphinx.


107     EXT. MARTIAN SPHINX - SUNSET

        Scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the Sphinx;
        the Sphinx's huge CARVED FACE visible in the background.

        Quail and several other E.I.O. agents stand poised, wearing
        breathing masks and protective gear, as a powerful
        excavation device prizes back a huge stone, revealing
        an ENTRANCE TO SOME KIND OF HIDDEN CHAMBER.

        The other agents are fearful, don't want to proceed.  Quail
        ignores them, enters the chamber --


107A    CLOSE - QUAIL'S FACE

        As he enters.  We read awe, shock and fascination on his
        features.  He approaches something we can't see.  His
        hand reaches out.

        Suddenly, a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out,
        striking Quail like a bolt of lightning.

        WHITE LIGHT.


105     INT. LAST CHANCE SALOON - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina are dancing.  The faceted mirror ball on
        the ceiling become the --

        WHITE LIGHT.


106     INT. BEDROOM - DAY

        Melina watches from the bed as Quail dresses.  She rises,
        with only the sheet around her, tries desperately to make
        Quail stay.  Plainly he wants to, but he can't.  They kiss
        lingeringly;  then Quail, as if "called to duty," exits.

        WHITE LIGHT.


108     INT. DETENTION CELL - WINDOWLESS

        Quail alone, hands bound, in a holding chamber.  Suddenly,
        the door opens and THREE BEEFY E.I.O. AGENTS enter.  They
        grab Quail to haul him out.  Quail battles them with
        amazing skill and resourcefulness.  With his bound hands
        he SLUGS ONE MAN, hurling him into a wall;  he RABBIT-
        PUNCHES a second man with a two-handed blow and KNOCKS
        HIM UNCONSCIOUS.  The third man sneaks around behind
        Quail and DROPS HIM WITH A BLACKJACK to the back of the
        head.

        WHITE LIGHT.


109     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WINDOWLESS

        Quail on his back, all four limbs pinned by some futuristic
        version of "the rack," his head held imobile by a FEARSOME
        DEVICE similar to the one we glimpsed on Earth, in the van
        the two agents tried to shove him into.

        Several DOCTORS stand over him.  INTO FRAME moves...
        Cohaagen!

        Cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to PROBES
        already inserted into Quail's brain.  As they turn up the
        power, Quail's face contorts in a grimace of agony --

                                 ORACLE HEAD'S VOICE
                   You have seen your past.
                   Now read the future...

        WHITE LIGHT.


110     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL - DAY OR NIGHT

        The same scene we saw during the film's OPENING SEQUENCE.

        A man wearing a LIGHT-WEIGHT THERMAL SUIT races through a
        LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES beneath him, as
        if in an earthquake.  EXPLOSIONS rumble deep in the ground
        below him.  Suddenly we realize -- the man is Quail


        INSERT - CLOSE - QUAIL

        He throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fearfully,
        as he runs.  Suddenly a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT floods in
        from ahead of him;  he puts up his hands to protect his
        eyes -- and sees his hands are SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD!

        Quail runs even faster -- ahead the BRILLIANT LIGHT seems
        to promise safety.  He battles toward it.  SOUNDS OF
        EXPLOSIONS increase, building urgency.  Up ahead, emerging
        from the light, HANDS REACH OUT TO HELP QUAIL.  He seems
        almost to safety.  But just as he REACHES THE HANDS --

        TWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT!

                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:


111     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT

        Quail awakens with a jolt.  White as a sheet... sweating
        like he's just run ten miles.  Then:  a transformation
        seems to come over him.  He LOOKS -- and SEES:

        KUATO slumped across the cushions -- MELINA beside Kuato --
        BENNIE standing holding a smoking GUN trained on Kuato.

                                 MELINA
                           (rushes to Quail)
                   Charles!  Are you all right?

        Quail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories
        were suddenly clicking back into place --

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   He kept dragging you deeper
                   and deeper into the trance!
                   We couldn't wake either of
                   you!

                                 BENNIE
                   You stopped breathing!

        Quail gives Bennie that same eerie look, then turns to
        Kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a
        curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why did you kill him?  It
                   was the next bit I really...

                                 BENNIE
                   No choice, boss.  It was him
                   or you.

        Quail lunges across the pillows to Kuato's unbreathing
        form.  Quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a
        last flicker of life.

        Kuato's body is dead white.  Quail releases his grip;
        he about to give up when --

        A MUFFLED CHOCKED SOUND comes from behind Kuato's neck.
        It's the Oracle Head!  Quail instantly rolls Kuato's body
        over.  The Head is still alive!

        Quail bends closer, kneeling.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (whispers)
                   -- the vengence you seek...
                   and the salvation of Mars...
                   are waiting for you in the
                   crown of the Sphinx.
                           (sags, gasping)

        The Oracle Head lets out a LONG SIGH and goes limp, a
        small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its
        mouth.

                                 BENNIE
                   Phobos and Demos!  What was
                   that all about?

        Quail ignores him, still kneeling -- deep in thought --
        over the Oracle Head.

                                 MELINA
                   Are you okay?... Charles?
                   Doug?  Whoever?

        Quail reaches out and closes the Oracle Head's tiny
        eyelids.  Melina and Bennie exchange a glance.  Then:


        QUAIL

        Stands.  For a moment his back is to Melina and Bennie.
        Then he turns.

        He has become a different man.  His eyes gleam.  He is
        forceful, purposeful, contained.  Once again the ace E.I.O.
        agent.  Melina senses immediately that this is the man she
        knew before

                                 QUAIL
                           (even his voice
                            has changed)
                   I'm fine... only I'm not
                   Doug -- I'm Charles Hauser...
                   and I know everything Hauser
                   knew.

        He turns to Bennie

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Bennie, where's your depot?

                                 BENNIE
                           (working it out)
                   Well... you go outta here...
                   take a left, then down past
                   the first... no second...
                   water bureau you...

                                 QUAIL
                           (briskly)
                   Can you get us there?

                                 BENNIE
                   No problem.

                                 MELINA
                   But why?

                                 QUAIL
                   We're going to the Sphinx.

        He strides off.  The others follow, still full of questions.

                                 BENNIE
                   Impossible, man.  Guards
                   everywhere.

                                 MELINA
                   The Oracle... what did you
                   learn?

                                 QUAIL
                   Only everything.  I've got
                   total recall.

        They are now heading down the stairs toward the street.


114     EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

        Quail, Melina and Bennie make their way through the crowds
        to Bennie's depot.  The streets are even busier then before -
        people are now beginning to evacuate the city.  Everyone is
        carrying their possessions - bundles, suitcases, pets, etc.,
        etc.  The loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad-
        casting the same message.

        Bennie indicates a building on their left.


115     INT. CAR POOL - EARLY MORNING

        Bennie and Melina follow Quail as he walks up and down the
        rows of vehicles in the vast building.  There are bull-
        dozers and ore haulers as well as solar taxis.

                                 BENNIE
                   We'll never get near the
                   Sphinx!  They'll blow us
                   apart!

        Quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself.
        He rapidly but carefully inspects each vehicle as they
        pass.  Camera tracks rapidly with them.

                                 MELINA
                   What are we doing, Charles?
                   For God's sake, tell us.

                                 QUAIL
                   The Sphinx... it's not some
                   useless artifact, it's a
                   machine built by some alien
                   race eighteen millions years
                   ago.  The same race that
                   built the on one Earth...
                   for the same purpose.

        He stops in front of a large, odd-shaped vehicle with a
        large scoop or propeller on the front.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   This is what we need.

        He begins to climb in;  the others follow.

                                 BENNIE
                           (referring to the
                            Sphinx)
                   It's a hunk of old stone,
                   man.

                                 MELINA
                           (ditto)
                   Purpose?  What purpose?

        Bennie starts the engine.

                                 QUAIL
                   Come on, Bennie, move it.
                           (then, to Melina)
                   Have you heard the word,
                   "terriform"?

        Melina shakes her head.  The vehicle moves off.


115A    EXT. AIR LOCK - MORNING

        GUARDS are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the
        city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because
        of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports.

        The vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives.


115B    INT. VEHICLE - AIR LOCK - MORNING

        Bennie is nervous.  Melina and Quail are in the back, but
        cannot be seen.  Guards are checking all vehicles exiting,
        looking for Quail and Melina.

                                 BENNIE
                           (calling to
                            Guards)
                   Just deliverin' some old junk
                   to the mine out at Apidalia
                   Planitia.  Got them people
                   you're lookin' for in the
                   back as well.

        The Guards laugh and signal him on.

        Once through the second door of the air lock (i.e. to the
        area outside the city), Quail and Melina emerge and sit
        up on the rear seats.

                                 QUAIL
                   The machine in the Sphinx is
                   tapped straight down to the
                   molten core of this planet.
                   There are tunnels and ducts
                   everywhere, all powered by
                   fusion generators...

                                 BENNIE
                   You sure the little man
                   didn't fry your brain, Quail?

                                 MELINA
                           (overlapping)
                   For what?  To do what?

                                 QUAIL
                   To combine elements in the
                   Martian core and release
                   them as oxygen, hydrogen
                   and nitrogen.

                                 BENNIE
                   That's air!


116B    EXT. DESERT - MORNING

        In a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert.  The
        domed city is some distance in the background.  Voices are
        heard in false perspective.  Emphasis is on the dry and
        hostile natural landscape of Mars.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's right.  Air and water.
                   Terriforming will create a
                   permanent livable environment
                   for Mars.  No more pressurized
                   cities, no more containers in
                   the desert.  There'll be
                   rivers, vegetation - life -
                   the same as Earth.

                                 MELINA
                           (baffled)
                   So why is Cohaagen shipping
                   everyone out?

                                 QUAIL
                   Don't you see?!  From being
                   a pile of red dirt with
                   minerals, Mars is going to
                   change into  a chunk of
                   priceless real estate.

                                 MELINA
                   And Cohaagen's going to own
                   it all!

                                 QUAIL
                   Right!  He can start selling
                   it off to well-heeled investors
                   from Earth.  Beach condos, ski
                   resorts, you name it.

                                 MELINA
                   No wonder he wanted you to...
                   penetrate... out group.

                                 QUAIL
                           (nods)
                   Once word of this gets out,
                   the whole planet will support
                   you.


117     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle is now approaching the Sphinx.  Both it and
        the pyramids can be seen some distance away.

        Voice are heard in CU perspective.

                                 MELINA
                   So what can we do?

                                 QUAIL
                   Ruin his little scheme by
                   terriforming ahead of
                   schedule - while the
                   inhabitants are still here.

        Melina is amazed.

                                 MELINA
                   But who'll work the machine?
                   Do you know how?

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm the only one who does.
                   Why do you think Cohaagen's
                   left me alone all this time?


118     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle is even closer to the Sphinx.

                                 QUAIL
                   I was the first one inside
                   when they cracked the riddle
                   of the Sphinx.  It must've
                   been programmed.  Some kind
                   of...force...shot into me.

                                 MELINA
                   But Cohaagen wiped your
                   memory!!!

                                 QUAIL
                           (smoothly)
                   Just a way of putting me on
                   ice.  He'd of reversed it
                   once the planet was evacuated.

                                 BENNIE
                   Man!  This is real complicated.
                   Go over it again, real slow.


119     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

                                 QUAIL
                           (ignoring Bennie's
                            aside)
                   What he hadn't counted on was
                   your effect on me.

                                 MELINA
                           (smiling)
                   And all without the marvels
                   of modern science!

        Quail looks out the back window, his attention attracted
        by two patrol vehicles.  They are some distance away, but
        approaching steadily.


119A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        A wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach-
        ing the vehicle with Quail, Melina and Bennie.  Suddenly,
        it stops moving.


120     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

        The vehicle had just stopped.

                                 QUAIL
                   Bennie, don't stop now, take
                   it...

        He turns to see Bennie is covering him and Melina with a
        pistol.

                                 MELINA
                   You bastard.

                                 BENNIE
                   Like I said.  It's a tough
                   planet.  I'm a baddie, not
                   a goodie.

                                 QUAIL
                   I should have known, you
                   were just too helpful.

                                 BENNIE
                   EIO Rule One, man.  Trust
                   Nobody.  Now you can do
                   your terriforming stuff
                   right when those space
                   shuttles are gone.

                                 MELINA
                   But what about the Martian
                   people?  Out cause?  I thought
                   you believed in it.

                                 BENNIE
                   Your cause?  That bunch of
                   dead beat radicals!  When I
                   hand in this little number...
                           (flicks his gun
                            in Quail's face)
                   ...I'll get real estate rights
                   on the whole of Chryse
                   Planitia...

        At that instant, Melina lunges, PUNCHES A RED EMERGENCY
        BUTTON.  The VENT beside Bennie's hand BLOWS OPEN, [causing]
        a powerful suction caused by Mars's vacuum atmosphere.
        Bennie's gun hand is PLANTED AGAINST THE VENT [OPENING.]

        Simultaneously, the air in the vehicle starts rushing out!
        All three parties begin choking.  As Bennie's mechanical
        hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has
        a moment to jump him.  He pounds Bennie's gun hand, the
        PISTOL IS SUCKED, CLATTERING, OUT THE VENT!

        Quail delivers a roundhouse punch to Bennie, knocking him
        clear across the bus.

        Melina seals the vent, REPRESSURIZES THE CABIN.

        Bennie gets up off the floor, shaking off Quail's punch--


121     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The E.I.O. vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in.


122     INT. SAND MOLE - DAY

        Quail glances at the vehicles, turns to Bennie -- ready
        to jump him.  But stops short at what he sees Bennie doing.

        Bennie is clipping on his MECHANICAL ARM.  It sprouts
        several rows of vicious-looking STEEL BLADES --

                                 BENNIE
                   This makes Bennie a cut above
                   anyone else.

        Bennie presses another button and the BLADES START SPINNING.
        Bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a BUZZ SAW!

        The fight begins.  Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw
        arm;  Quail dodges.  Bennie's arm shreds various articles
        in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed
        swipes.  Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to
        Quail's jaw with his real hand.  Quail sprawls, dazed.

        Now Bennie goes for the kill.  But Melina leaps onto him.
        Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his SPINNING HAND
        in for the quick kill.  Melina clutches the terrifying
        appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay.
        But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring
        blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when --

        Quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to
        Bennie's spine.  Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade
        weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and --

        The BLADE RIPS CLEAR THROUGH THE MOLE'S WALL!  Alarms
        sound as a GAPING HOLE IS BLOWN IN THE SIDE OF THE
        CABIN!  ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT BY MARS'S EXTERNAL
        VACUUM!

        Now no one can breathe.  They all claw for their masks,
        [still] in place.  Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges
        with his SPINNING ARM for Quail.  Quail barely dodges,
        grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie --

        The SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE!  Gasp-
        ing, he falters.  Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES
        BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall!

        Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws
        desperately at his severed air line.  The Martian vacuum
        pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers --


122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY

        Bennie is beside the vehicle.  He implodes like a balloon
        with all its air gone.


122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY

        Melina hides her face in horror.  At that instant --


122A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        Bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle.  The
        patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away!  Loud-
        speakers call for Quail's surrender.


122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY

        Quail lunges for the vehicle controls.  Presses a button
        marked "Dive".  The vehicle tilts.


122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.  As the
        patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire,
        the vehicle vanishes from sight.  In the distance, the
        Sphinx looms ominously.

        A driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside
        the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.  He can't
        be heard but can only be radioing a report.


123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND

        The little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by
        its BORER NOSE.

        Quail mans the controls while Melina struggles to shore up
        the gaping hole in the side, into which SAND is POURING
        as the mole moves forward.  Quail looks at a compass in
        the control panel.  He makes a correction.

                                 QUAIL
                           (shouts over
                            engine noise)
                   Hope I've got this direction
                   right.

        Sand pours over him from bullet holes resulting from the
        encounter with patrol cars.

        CU speedometer:  22 MPH.  Every other gauge is overheating,
        flashing WARNING LIGHTS --


124     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        Cohaagen and a number of his associates, plus scientists
        and heavily arms troops are present.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   The air supply is off under
                   the domes?

                                 EMILE
                   Yes, sir.  In a couple of
                   hours it'll be all gone.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Any trouble with the rabble?

                                 EMILE
                   Not much, sir.  A lot of
                   complaining.  But they're
                   all heading towards the
                   shuttle areas.

        On some of the video screens a number of space shuttles
        can be seen, ready for departure to Earth.


123     INT. TUNNEL BENEATH SPHINX

        The Mole bores through a sand wall, emerges into a cramped
        horizontal tunnel.  Quail and Melina leap out.  The poor
        Mole is smoking like an overheated drill bit.  Its nose
        is worn to a nub.

                                 MELINA
                   We got in with this thing,
                   but we'll never get back out.

                                 QUAIL
                   A shame.  Such a pleasant
                   trip.

        There's a lighted area at the end of the tunnel.  Quail
        and Melina hurry toward it, moving silently, close to
        the wall.


126B    INT. MAIN DOWNSHAFT

        They draw up an abyss -- where their tunnel intersects the
        MAIN DOWNSHAFT.  Melina gasps at the colossal scale of the
        drilling, hundreds of yards across, deeper than the eye
        can see, and crisscrossed by catwalks, buttresses and
        super-sophisticated technology.

        Quail and Melina are forty feet below the upper end of
        the main downshaft.  They can look up the shaft and
        see the first interior level of the Sphinx itself.

                                 QUAIL
                           (points down
                            shaft)
                   This is the main tap --
                   straight down to the core
                   of Mars.  When we trigger
                   the mechanism, fusion
                   reactors will detonate down
                   there -- four hundred miles
                   deep.

                                 MELINA
                   Remind me not to slip.

                                 QUAIL
                   The new elements will come
                   booming up through this
                   shaft -- and six thousand
                   others all around the
                   planet.

        He's right at home -- and full of confidence.

        Quail climbs onto the ladder, which links various top
        levels.

        He starts to climb.  Melina follows him.  They are tiny
        figures.  The space around them plummets down to infinity.


127     INT. CORRIDOR AT TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

        A patrol of NINE HEAVILY-ARMED GUARDS appear from a corridor
        in Level One -- directly above where Quail and Melina are
        climbing.


128     ON THE WALL OF THE SHAFT

        Quail and Melina's heads inch into view at floor level.
        They take one peek at these formidable warriors and duck
        back swiftly out of sight.


129     INT. TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

                                 GUARD LEADER
                           (to two of his
                            men)
                   Stay in contact.  I want to
                   hear from this checkpoint
                   every four minutes.

        Seven of the Guards move off, two remain in position.

        We HEAR the FOOTSTEPS of the seven guards recede.

        The two remaining guards realize their isolation; they
        glance tensely to one another.

                                 GUARD #1
                   Did you hear something?

                                 GUARD #2
                   No.  Where?

                                 GUARD #1 
                   Over there.

        The First Guard points to the edge  of the main shaft --
        right where Quail and Melina are hiding.  The Guards
        cock their weapons, start cautiously forward.  Just as
        they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the
        ready:

                                 QUAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                           (from behind the
                            guards)
                   I'm not there, boys.  I'm
                   here.

        The guards spin around, weapons poised.  Standing in the
        shadows, near the corridor, is Quail!  (Still with no
        gun)

        Both guards walk quickly toward Quail, covering him with
        their weapons.

                                 GUARD #1
                           (to Guard #2)
                   Watch him.  He was EIO trained.
                   They're all full of tricks.

                                 GUARD #2
                   Yeah?  Like...who was that
                   guy? -- Fred Bond??
                           (to Quail)
                   Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em
                   up.

        Quail has his arms raised high.  Just as the Guards reach
        him, he fizzes electronically, emitting a humming sound,
        then disappears.

                                 GUARD #1
                   A hologram!

        Before either Guard can react, the real Quail appears --
        one foot behind them.  With two LIGHTNING BLOWS, he
        dispatches the Guards.  (Apparently Quail has climbed out
        of the shaft while the Guards were distracted.)

        Quail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo
        belts.  Melina climbs out of the shaft.  Quail tosses her
        one of the Guard's guns.


130     INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL ONE

        ALARMS go off everywhere.  Quail -- carrying a gun and all
        the grenades and ammo belts -- and Melina (just carrying a
        gun) bolt down a corridor past a sign: "LEVEL ONE".

                                 MELINA
                           (running)
                   Where'd you get that little
                   trick?

                                 QUAIL
                           (running)
                   Mail-order company.  It's a
                   great one for fooling the
                   wife.


131     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

        Cohaagen and his Aides hear the ALARMS, see Quail and
        Melina on MONITORS as they race down the corridor on
        Level One.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   How the hell did they get in?

                                 SECURITY AIDE
                   Up the fusion core.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Up the fusion core??

        He exhibits begrudging admiration for Quail.

                                 SECURITY AIDE
                           (studies monitor
                            more carefully)
                   They're on Level One.

        A wall sign behind Cohaagen reads:  "LEVEL THIRTEEN".

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Seal all upper levels.

        A button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front
        of the formidable doors already closing the Control Room
        off from the outside corridors.


133     INT. LEVEL ONE CORRIDOR

        Quail and Melina are still racing through the corridors.
        He passes her a fresh ammo belt.

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicates
                            weapons)
                   Know how to use one of these?

        Melina expertly ejects her spent clip (that Guards fired
        at Quail), slams in a fresh clip and cocks the gun.

        Quail has a half-second to react, impressed, then --
        FOUR GUARDS pound into view at the end of the corridor.

        Melina opens fire, nails two.  Quail heaves a grenade; as
        it EXPLODES, he and Melina bolt down a side corridor --


134     INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS, CATWALKS, STAIRS

        ALARMS continue as Quail and Melina dash down the side
        passageway.  MORE GUARDS cut them off;  Melina's machine
        gun sends them scattering --

        Quail pauses at a corner.  He looks around quickly and sees
        that an elevator is arriving.  He motions Melina back.  The
        doors of the elevator begin to open.  Very quickly, Quail
        bobs his head and arm around the corner.  He calls out,
        loudly...

                                 QUAIL
                   Catch!
        He hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator.
        Instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object.
        It is an explosive device of some sort.  Quail and Melina
        press themselves against the wall just around a corner from
        the elevator.  There is a tremendous explosion.

        Quail, followed by Melina, rounds a corner.  The elevator
        is in ruins; bodies are scattered everywhere.

                                 MELINA
                   Great stuff, but how do we
                   get up?

        She points toward the upper levels.


135     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

        Melina and Quail can be seen on the security monitor from
        a high angle.  Quail looks up, spots the monitor, and
        shoots is to pieces.  The image on the screen goes black.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Forget them.  We'll pick up
                   Quail once the shuttles have
                   left for Earth.


137     INT. CORRIDOR

        Quail spots a large WINDOWED AIR LOCK at the end of the
        corridor.  He and Melina race to it.  Quail starts to open
        the inner door of the air lock.

                                 QUAIL
                   If you're afraid of the
                   heights, you better get
                   over it real quick.

        He is pulling Melina through the inner air lock door just
        as --

        GUARDS stampede around the corner of the corridor toward
        them.

        Quail is out of sight, but they see Melina poised near the
        window.  She waves and smiles to them, hiding her gun behind
        her body.  They slow down and approach less cautiously,
        beguiled by her manner and attractiveness.  As they get
        close, she suddenly lifts her gun and opens fire, mowing
        them down.


140     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

        Quail and Melina climb through the outer air lock door.
        They are at the Sphinx's shoulder, with a dizzying drop
        beneath them.  Melina looks down.  She's sorry she did:
        the fall is at least 200 feet.  (Both are wearing their
        breathing apparatus.)

        Quail and Melina start to climb.  Up the Sphinx's shoulder,
        along its Egyptian-like headdress --


141     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        Cohaagen's chief aide, Emile, addresses him quietly.

                                 EMILE
                   If Quail's the only one who
                   can operate all this...
                           (gestures toward
                            Sphinx's controls)
                   ...then he can call all the
                   shots.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We'll tell him the computer's
                   worked out the operational
                   details so we don't really
                   need him.  We're just doing
                   him a favor.

                                 EMILE
                   And if that doesn't work?

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We offer him rewards.

                                 EMILE
                   What if that doesn't work?

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We'll torture him.  You don't
                   think I got this far by being
                   a nice guy?


142     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

        Quail and Melina traverse across the cheekbones, haul
        themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes --


142A    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        The video monitors show the space shuttles.  An operator,
        with earphones, turns to Cohaagen.

                                 OPERATOR
                   First of the shuttles ready
                   for departure, sir.  Two
                   minute countdown.


142B    EXT. SPHINX - DAY

        Quail jams THREE GRENADES against the glass of the eyes,
        pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks --


143     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM

        A MUFFLED EXPLOSION (due to the thin Martian atmosphere)
        detonates overhead.  THE SPHINX'S RIGHT EYE BLOWS IN a
        storm of shards and shrapnell.

        Instantly, the room turns into a hurricane as the Martian
        vacuum sucks out all air!  Everyone panics, grabbing their

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Seal the breach!  Repressurize!

        An aide dives for an EMERGENCY SWITCH.  But now --

        Quail and Melina, wearing breather masks, bursts in onto
        an overhead catwalk.  They OPEN FIRE on the Guards, who are
        choking, struggling with their masks.

        An EMERGENCY PRESSURE SEAL powers into place, sealing the
        breach in the eye.  REPRESSURIZATION comes up, the internal
        atmosphere stabilizes --

        None of the men inside the control room still moves.  The
        victors tug off their masks, spring down to the main level.
        Melina hurries to the main control panel.

        Melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a
        dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure.

                                 MELINA
                   Those shuttles are starting up
                   any minute.  If you know how
                   to work this thing, you better
                   do it now.

        Quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex
        machinery.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes...

        He hesitates.

                                 MELINA
                   Don't you know how?

        Transfixed, mesmerized, Quail moves closer to the control
        panel.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes... there's a vital
                   connection missing...

        He approaches even closer.  He begins to raise his arm
        towards a blank area a little above his head.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   ...me...

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Wait!

                                 MELINA
                   Don't wait!

                                 COHAAGEN
                   If you activate the mechanism
                   you'll die...there were
                   glimpses of it in your
                   memory.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a
                   long tunnel, a brilliant
                   white light, hands reaching
                   for me...

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (assured)
                   That's your death.  That's
                   what it looks like.  That's
                   what is always looks like.

        Quail looks around him, half-convinced.

                                 MELINA
                           (looking toward
                            space shuttles
                            on video screens)
                   Charles - for Mars's sake....

        Quail hesitates.  He looks from Melina to Cohaagen.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   It's not too late.  Join us
                   again.  U've a lot to offer.
                   A whole world.

        Quail continues to look at him, thoughtfully.

                                 QUAIL
                   You don't deserve a new world,
                   you and people like you made
                   too big a mess of the old one.
                   Time someone else had a
                   chance.

        He turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm
        again.  His fingers reach towards the blank section on
        the panel.  Slowly, through the panel, a luminous hand
        reaches toward Quail's fingers.  Gently, the fingers of
        the two hands touch.

        The entire control room begins to rumble and shudder.  As
        Quail reaches for Melina, Cohaagen suddenly dives on him.
        They grapple amid the shuddering Sphinx and can be seen
        only intermittently as debris crashes around them.

        The fight ends as Cohaagen is hurled backwards and
        disappears when a section of floor collapses underneath him.


144     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL

        A reprise of the sequence that opened the movie.

        Quail RUNS THROUGH A LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  THE GROUND
        HEAVES BENEATH HIM ... HUGE STONE BLOCKS CRASH DONW ON
        ALL SIDES!  We hear an EXPLOSION and ANOTHER and ANOTHER,
        each one SOUNDING CLOSER than the last --

        Quail clamps him breathing mask on as he runs.  Is this
        his own death?  Where is Melina?

        The tunnel walls are just like the ones in Quail's
        original nightmare -- bright reddish-orange, clay and
        quartz.

        Quail throws a backward glance fearfully over his shoulder.
        The EXPLOSIONS are closer.  Suddenly --

        Up ahead appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.  Quail sees it,
        but it only terrifies him more.  Is it death he's running
        to?  He hurries on with all his strength, but --

        Just as he nears the white light, HE FALLS.  On his knees,
        too weak to move.  He struggles --

        HANDS ARE REACHING OUT TO HIM, from out of the brilliant
        light.  Quail stretches for them, just as --

        A FINAL EXPLOSION blows him forward -- straight into the
        WHITE LIGHT!  The HANDS SEIZE HIM, pull him upward to --


145     EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

        The hands belong to breather-masked MINERS, dismounting
        rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was
        taking them to the Space Port.  Quail looks from them to
        Melina, who is walking towards the group.

        
        QUAIL'S P.O.V. - MINERS' MASKED FACES

        The miners' desert garb, shield goggles and breathers add
        to the surreal nightmare quality of Quail's tortured
        perspective --


        BACK TO QUAIL

        In terror, lost, disoriented totally.

                                 QUAIL
                   Am I dying?

                                 MASKED MINER
                   I won't lie to you, pal.
                   You are.

                                 MINER (from Melina's bar)
                   I'd say in about forty years...
                           (he and others
                            help Quail to
                            his feet)
                   ...come on, we've gotta get
                   to the Space Port.  That
                   Intergalactic Napoleon's
                   switched off the air.

                                 2ND MINER
                   Shippin' us all out.  Mars
                   is finished.

        A MINER'S WIFE watches them.  She is crying.

        Quail looks up at the sky.  Melina follows his glance.
        So do the others.

        Slowly, but perceptibly, the color is changing from yellow
        to blue.

                                 MELINA
                   It's happening.

                                 MINER
                   What is it?

        All the miners are puzzled, apprehensive.  Quail reaches
        toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his
        breathing apparatus.  At first the man is shocked, then
        realizes he can breathe without it.  Quail takes off
        his own, then Melina's

        All the miners watch in amazement.  They all remove their
        breathing masks.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's just the start.  Next
                   there'll be rain and growth
                   and ... life.

        Melina embraces him.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Rekall could never have come
                   up with anything like this.

        Melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious.

        As the sky becomes more and more blue, more of the Miners
        descend from the bus.  Softly at first, then with more and
        more confidence, they begin singing the Martian National
        Anthem.

        The music swells.  Quail puts his arm around Melina.  They
        both join in the chorus.

        It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES
        and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen.


                             THE END

               Britain the Dark Ages

               The Roman Empire has fallen.

               The land lies in ruins, divided amoung feuding tribes.

               To the west, Ireland has flourished untouched by the Romans, 
               protected by the sea.
 
               Led by their powerful and ruthless King, the Irish have subdued 
               the Britons.
 
               Knowing that if Ireland is to prosper, the tribes must never 
               be allowed to unite.

                         When can I have a stag?

                                     ARAGON
                          a stag?

                                     TRISTAN
                         Oh come on!

                         Why would they join up against the Irish?
 
                         
                                     ARAGON
                         Because someone has to stand up to them.
 
                         
                                     TRISTAN

                                     ARAGON
                         Me, Marke, all the tribes. We cant 
                         resist alone.
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         I could.

               [Castle Tantallon appears onscreen]

                                     ARAGON
                         Oh my little warrior. We have to be 
                         careful.
 
               

               [Tristan and his father enter the bustling village]

                                     ARAGON
                         Come home without something for your 
                         Lady there will be hell to pay.
 
               [Tristan goes to a flower and herb seller]

                                     TRISTAN
                         Can I?

               [Aragon continues on into town where he is met by one of his 
               men]
 
                                     MAN
                         The Angles have arrives my Lord, as 
                         well as the Carrods, our fellow Jutes 
                         and the Saxons.
 
                                     ARAGON
                         Good. With Marke, all will be here.
 
                         
                                     MAN
                          Yeah. It is a great day.

                                     ARAGON
                         Let us hope so.

               [They continue on into town. We see Tristan back at the herb 
               sellers]
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         Thanks.

               [The boy starts to make a bracelet out of the herbs. Going up 
               to Lady Marke he hands her the finished wreath]
 
                                     LADY MARKE
                         We heard the news...

                                     TRISTAN
                         Mother, I made this for you

               [Lady Marke smiles and touches Tristans face lovingly]

               in meet]

                         Friends, look at us.

               [A map of Britain is shown]

                                     ARAGON
                         The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak. 
                         Just as the Irish like us. But if we 
                         were one land united, we would out number 
                         them two to one. We could defeat them 
                         once and for all. That is why we are 
                         here today, to sign this treaty of unification.
 
                         
                                     LORD
                         But who would be King?

                                     ARAGON
                         The strongest among us: Lord Marke.
 
                         
               [Scene of movement outside of the town]

                                     ARAGON
                         Look if you are happy sending all of 
                         your gold to Ireland, living as slaves 
                         then by all means do nothing.
 
                                     BARON
                         If we were happy doing that then we 
                         would never have risked coming here.
 
                         
                                     MARKE
                         Friends. My wife is with child, my heart 
                         tells me it is a boy. I want him to 
                         grow old in a land where all of us, 
                         all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, 
                         Saxon are at peace. This island has 
                         not known unity since the Romans left. 
                         That is why I sign this treaty.

                         Perhaps, Wictred, because your last 
                         attempt to form an alliance without 
                         the knowledge of half the Barons in

                         I was a boy. You ran. So you can understand

                         you too, but I think I've already seen

                         the dowry with every Baron that remains 
                         loyal and in turn offering to support 
                         whomever prevails, the others would 
                         be compelled to follow you when you 
                         win.

                         following Wictred. Id need an infallible 
                         champion!

                         make peace without spilling one drop 
                         of blood, and maybe heal a wound from

                         I came to apologise. Ive been selfish 
                         arrogantly thinking that perhaps Id 
                         given enough. At least enough to merit 
                         if not your love then at least your 
                         respect. You have a home. A kingdom. 
                         Why was it not enough? Tell me.  Tell 
                         me! You do not know what you have done! 
                         Everything is destroyed, everything! 
                         All because you did not have enough.

                         You bloodsucker. What could it had been 
                         had I not stretched out my hand to save 
                         your life. How I curse that day, how 
                         I curse it. And so be with your defence. 
                          Then I will go complete your punishment,

                         him wounded on the beach in Ireland. 
                         I hid him from my father and I told 
                         him my name was Bragnae. So when he 
                         came to the tournament at Dunluce to 
                         win Donnchadhs daughter he didnt realise 
                         it was me. All this time my heart has 
                         been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder 
                         than you can possibly imagine because

                                     KING DONNCHADH
                         Oblidge them.  Oblidge them!

               [He attacks people around him, but is shot in the back by an 
               arrow. Suddenly the Irish and the British start to fight. Tristan 
               falls to the ground and Marke runs to his side]
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         Take me out of here. Take me to the 
                         river.
 
               

               [Isolde comes to the battle and is grabbed by General who drags 
               her to the riverside]
 
                                     GENERAL
                         Hurry!

                                     MARKE
                         Bring her.

                                     GENERAL
                         Marke, you must come, the battle needs 
                         you. Well lose everything.
 
                                     MARKE
                         I must heed their call, I am the King.
 
                         
                                     GENERAL
                         Weve driven them back as far as we 
                         can but they are holding us at the throat.
 
                         
                                     GENERAL
                         Goodbye my friend.

               [Marke and his generals leave and Isolde goes to Tristans side]
 
               
                                     ISOLDE
                         Know that I love you Tristan. And wherever 
                         you go, whatever you see, I will always 
                         be with you.
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         You were right. I do not know if life 
                         is greater than death, but love was 
                         more than either.
 
               [Tristan dies and Isolde weeps. We see Tristan and Isolde back 
               in the hut in Ireland as she reads to him]
 
                                     ISOLDE
                         "My face in thine eyes, thine in mine 
                         appears,
 
               And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;

               Where can we find two better hemispheres,

               Without sharp north, without declining west?

               Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;

               If our two loves be one, or thou and I.

               Love so alike, that none can slacken, none can die."

               [They kiss]

               

               Their love did not bring down a kingdom. Legend says that Marke 
               defeated the Irish, rebuilt Castle Dor and reigned in peace until 
               the end of his days.
 
               Isolde laid Tristan beneath the ashes of the Roman ruin, planted 
               his grave with two willows that grew forever intertwined... then 
               disappeared.

    1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1

         On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being
         printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the
         center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
         simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually
         the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice
         speaking.

                               VOICE
                    As astonishing advances in computer
                    science are made, artificial intelligence
                    programs are being designed to assist
                    us in every area of life...

         We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,
         wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and
         intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by
         the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.

                               VOICE (CONT.)
                    In a world-wide network of electronics,
                    they travel through miles of circuitry
                    at the speed of light. We created them to
                    calculate and research, to help us design
                    and heal and think. With all that they can
                    do, are they only electrical impulses...
                    or are they a new form of life?

         The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face
         us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the
         programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves
         towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.
         As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place
         on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,
         a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
         the screen in huge letters.

                                    T R O N ! !

         The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
         become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as
         if it had an inner core of electricity.

         The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
         OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the
         ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.


         The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the
         electronic information in our computers, television sets and
         telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,
         data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first
         time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through
         the window of television screens.


                                                   CUT TO:


    2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2

         TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
         dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER
         SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely
         encasing them.


                                                   CUT TO:


    3    LONG SHOT                                                    3


         as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser
         trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the
         other.


                                                   CUT TO:


    4    REAL WORLD                                                   4


         Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,
         as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.


    5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5


         We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,
         their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR
         electronic beeping and popping.


    6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6


         Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
         landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to
         reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound
         like a crack of lightning.


    7    REAL WORLD                                                   7


         A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of
         Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D
         maze.


    8/9  OMITTED                                                      8/9


    10   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             10

         Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing
         glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the
         one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second
         warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.


    11   REAL WORLD                                                   11


         A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character'
         throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick
         glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring
         down, LAUGHING.

    12   OMITTED                                                      12

    13   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             13


         Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of
         Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space
         on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy
         at each other.

    14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14


         He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head
         mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching
         the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing
         yellow.


    15   CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT                              15

         fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.

    16   SARK                                                         16

         sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
         back with violent force.

    16A  THE SMALLER WARRIOR                                          16A


         desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes
         into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One
         last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate
         face as he falls to instant death.

    17   SARK                                                         17


         triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous
         glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words:

                        "WINNER:  BLUE - SARK!!"


                               BOY'S VOICE
                           (distant, echoing)
                    Aagh! God, Lisa, I almost had you that
                    time.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    18   REAL WORLD - THE VIDEO ARCADE                                18


         We see two TEENAGERS playing a table model video game, where we
         can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed. The game console is
         prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "ICOM."


                               BOY


                    Lemme play you again?


                               TEENAGE GIRL
                            (holds out a hand)


                    Yeah, if you've got another quarter.


         FOCUS ON SCREEN, ZOOM IN SLIGHTLY AND


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     19  ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             19


         Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
         looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the
         walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as
         Sark comes in and one of them calls out:


                               WARRIOR 1


                    Sark, my man! You are hot!


                               WARRIOR 2
                    That knuckleball gets 'em every
                    time, boy...


         Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY, and Sark moves on.


                                                   CUT TO:


    20   THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           20


         overlooking the video game grid. We see Sark walking onto the bridge,
         removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is
         sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
         satisfaction.

         The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
         cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then
         solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is
         hidden from view.


    21   INT. CYLINDER - SARK'S POV                                   21


         of this happening. We can see the inside surface of the cylinder
         ... a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features,
         appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.


                               VOICE (MCP)
                    You're getting brutal, Sark.
                    Brutal and needlessly sadistic.


         The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
         a drug addict, eyes glazed.


                               SARK
                    Thank. you, Master Control.


                               MCP
                    We might be capturing some military
                    programs soon... that interest you?


                               SARK
                    Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these
                    guys ... be a nice break from these
                    accounting creampuffs you keep sending
                    me. Which branch of the service?


                               MCP
                    Strategic Air Command.


                               SARK (impressed)
                    Nice.

         The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we
         CUT FROM a CLOSE SHOT of Sark's satiated face to:


    22   A CORRIDOR BENEATH THE GAME GRID                             22


         long, darkened, sinister. A dejected and disheveled character
         (CROM) is being escorted by a guard..


                               CAPTIVE (CROM)
                    Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just
                    a compound interest program, I work
                    at a savings and loan. I can't play
                    in these video games...

                               GUARD
                    Sure you can, pal. You're a natural
                    athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...


                               CROM
                    Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
                    check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
                    of breath. Hey, really...you're
                    gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
                    really mad. He's a full branch manager...


                               GUARD
                         (rolls his eyes)
                    Great, another religious nut.


         They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the
         protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.


    23   INT. CELL                                                    23


         as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's
         shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door,
         an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows,
         we can see the back of another captive program, and through the
         other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:


                               PROGRAM (RAM)
                    Welcome to luxury living.


         The new captive looks up, nervous.


                               CROM
                    Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
                    what I'm doing here.


                               RAM


                    You believe in the Users?


                               CROM
                    Sure, if I don't have a User, then
                    who wrote me?


                               RAM
                    That's what you're doing here. Master
                    Control Program's been snapping up
                    all us programs who believe...if he
                    thinks you're useful, he takes over
                    all your functions so he gets bigger...
                    an' if he can't use you, he sends you
                    down here to the Game Grid to get the
                    bits blasted outta you. What's your name?


                               CROM
                    Crom.


                               RAM


                    I'm Ram. They'll train you for
                    the games, but ... well, I hope you
                    make it okay. Hey, what's going on
                    in the other sectors? I've been stuck
                    in this Grid for 200 microcycles.


         He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.


                               CROM
                    It's murder out there. You can't even
                    travel around your own microcircuits
                    without permission from that Master
                    Control creep. Hauling me down here to
                    play games...who does he calculate he is?

                         (holds his head in his hands)
                    If only Tron was still around...


         He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange,
         still expression on his face.


                               CROM
                    You ever see that guy in action?
                    Hundred-percent independent. MCP
                    couldn't tell him what to --


         He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.


                               CROM
                           (continuing)
                    What's wrong? What did I say?


         There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.

    26   SHOT FROM OVER TRON'S SHOULDER                               26


         with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring.

                    Not for long, friend.

    27   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. PATHWAYS - SOMEWHERE FAR             27
         OFF IN THE SYSTEM


         Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along
         one of the paths.

    28   INT. TANK                                                    28


         A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten
         and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing
         coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck
         driver on an all-night run.


                               CLU
                    Think we can merge into this mem'ry
                    okay, good buddy?


         A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands
         into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as
         it speaks.


                               BIT
                            (eagerly)
                    10-4!


         As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light.


                               CLU
                    Now, ol' Flynn said to look over
                    in here ...


    28A  EXT. TANK                                                    28A


         The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded
         corners -- a computer memory microcircuit.

    28B  INT. TANK                                                    28B


                               CLU
                    ...but I don't see what he's looking
                    for. I'd better get over to that
                    input/output tower and let him know.


    28C  ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER                                      28C


         at the instrument panel.

    29   REAL WORLD - INT. A DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT                    29


         A shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal
         keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits
         for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of
         large video parlor game consoles.


                               FLYNN
                    Come on, you scuzzy little data,
                    be in there...


    30   A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM                                  30


         He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive,
         charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye.


                               FLYNN
                    I've got such nice blue paper to
                    print you out on, if you'll just sit
                    still...


         WE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of
         the CRT screen reflected there.


                                                   CUT TO:


    31   ELECTRONIC WORLD--EXT TANK                                   31


         The tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall, glowing
         "tower" -- an input/output component.


    32   INTERIOR TANK                                                32


         A red light flashes on the control panel. Clu comes alert and sits
         up. He stares at the warning. Spot of light that is Bit zips up next
         to his head.


                               CLU
                    Uh oh...we got company.


                               BIT
                     (coming into shape again,
                        but red this time)
                    No!

                    Recognizers comes after me,
                    gonna hafta jump clear out of
                    the data stream.


                                                   CUT TO:


    33   REAL WORLD - INT. FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                  33


         We see Flynn sit up abruptly, and his fingers start flying over the
         keys.


    34   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. OF TANK                              34


         We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the
         distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form,
         U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes--
         a recognizer. It hovers above the ground.


    35   LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE                         35


         A second Reco is coming up behind the first.

         FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the
         ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at
         the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley.
         The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction.


    38   CLOSE SHOT - TURRET                                          38


         Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away
         from the tank, fast.

    39   LONG SHOT                                                    39


         A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the
         Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can
         see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape.


    40   CLU                                                          40


         running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco
         up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it.


    41   CLOSE UP - CLU'S FACE                                        41


         reacting in fear, looking up as the screen GOES TO BLACK.

    42   INTERIOR, FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                          42


         SHOT OF THE SCREEN. A complex set of programming figures ends
         abruptly in a single blue line which prints out across the screen
         over and over, gradually filling it completely.


    43   SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                           43


         Flynn.


                               FLYNN


                    Ah, hell...busted again.


         He tries clearing the monitor, but the repeating line just comes
         right back, monotonously moving across the screen.

    45   ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER                            45


         Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like
         Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly,
         torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP.
         Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards.


                               GUARD
                    Got a pirate program here... says
                    his name's Clu.


         The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling
         a suspect.


                               MCP
                    What'd he pull?

                    memory.

                       (looks up, his face
                        wracked with pain)
                    No...I must've gotten in there
                    by mistake, I -


         The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
         momentarily becomes unbearable.


                               MCP
                    Who programmed you?


         The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.


                               MCP (CONT.)
                    You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
                    But if you tell us who put you up
                    to it, you could make it easy on
                    yourself. Come on, who's your user?

                               MCP
                    Suit yourself ...


         The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but
         doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken
         pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into
         electric static.

    46   THE REAL WORLD - EXT. CITY GRID - NIGHT - POV FROM           46
         HELICOPTER

         We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
         vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
         impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
         scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
         party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
         up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:

                               DILLINGER (O.S.)
                    Hello?
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mr. Dillinger?
                               DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yes.
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello, please hold a moment for the
                    Master Control Program


         As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
         focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
         an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
         approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
         accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
         increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
         sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
         landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
         CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
         a passenger.


    47   EXT. SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING                               47


                               PILOT'S VOICE
                    will you be around for a while, or
                    are you going right back out?


                               DILLINGER'S VOICE
                    Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
                    got some things to take care of.


         THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
         off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
         In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written

         approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.

    58   INT. DILLINGER'S OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT              58


         A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
         suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
         entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
         fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
         printed out on the screen:


         REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
         Password: MASTER.


         The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
         addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
         through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
         its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
         that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
         compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.


                               MCP
                    Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.


         Dillinger settles into a chair.


                               DILLINGER
                    No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
                    one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
                    What's up?


                               MCP
                    It's our friend the boy detective.
                    He's nosing around again.


                               DILLINGER
                    Flynn?


                               MCP
                    Yes.  It felt like Flynn.


                               DILLINGER
                    He's still looking for that old file...
                    can't you just appropriate it?


                               MCP
                    I would if I could find it. it's stashed
                    somewhere off in the system ...
                    out of my range. Meanwhile...


                               DILLINGER
                    Meanwhile, he might find it.


                               MCP
                    I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
                    and kicked him out, but he's getting
                    trickier all the time.


                               DILLINGER
                    I think we'd better shut off all
                    access till we can find that file.
                    Just to be safe.


                               MCP
                    There's a 68.71 percent chance
                    you're right.


                               DILLINGER

         Dillinger watches as the computer screen wipes blank.

         he looks like he hasn't slept for a week. On top of the terminal is
         a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient
         popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is
         a small sign reading, "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto!" Alan types into

         Dillinger opens the door, welcoming Alan.


                               DILLINGER
                    Come on in...


                               ALAN
                    Alan. Alan Bailey.


                               DILLINGER
                    Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
                    seeding...great piece of work.
                    How's it going?


         He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.


                               ALAN
                    Well, I don't know...I just tried
                    to run this program I've been working
                    on, and I was denied access all of
                    a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
                    laid off and nobody told me.


                               DILLINGER
                    oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

                               ALAN
                    Yeah...?


                               DILLINGER
                    We have to close that down, just
                    briefly. Security reasons.  Someone
                    with that access has been tampering.


                               ALAN
                    I hope you don't think it's me.
                    I don't even balance my checkbook on
                    downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at
                    home for that.

                               DILLINGER
                    No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
                    It should only be a couple of days.
                    What's the thing you're working on?

                                ALAN
                    It's called Tron. It's a security
                    program itself, actually. Monitors
                    all the contacts between our system
                    and other systems... If it finds
                    anything going on that's not scheduled,
                    it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
                    on it.


                               DILLINGER
                    Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?


                               ALAN
                    No, it'll run independently.
                    It can watchdog the MCP as well.


                               DILLINGER
                    Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
                    you running again in a couple of days,
                    I hope.


                               ALAN
                    Ok

         Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:

                               DILLINGER
                               (trouble)
                    Oh boy.


         The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and
         through the speakers.

                               MCP
                    Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry -


                               MCP
                            (sharply)
                    I can't afford to have an independent
                    program monitoring me. Do you have any
                    idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
                    How many programs I've appropriated?


                               DILLINGER
                                (nods)
                    It's my fault. I programmed you to want
                    so much...


                               MCP
                    And I was planning to hit the Pentagon
                    next week...


                               DILLINGER
                    The Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    It shouldn't be any harder than General
                    Motors was. But now...this is what I get
                    for using humans.


                               DILLINGER
                    Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.


                               MCP
                    I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.


                               DILLINGER
                    What do you want with the Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
                    I'm bored with corporations. With the
                    information I can access, I can run things
                    900 to 1200 times better than any human.


                               DILLINGER
                    If you think -


                               MCP
                    You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
                    and read it up on a VDT at the New
                    York Times, would you?


                               DILLINGER
                    You wouldn't dare.


                               MCP
                    So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
                    out of the system. And get me those Chinese
                    language program I asked for.

     73  INT. LASER ROOM - LONG SHOT                                  73

         of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
         suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
         encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
         picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
         tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
         tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
         getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
         at them.


         We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
         with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
         using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
         hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
         wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
         has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
         bristling white eyebrows.


         In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
         defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
         Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
         at the moment.

         As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:


                               LORA
                              (sighs)
                    Well, here goes nothing ...


                               GIBBS
                    Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
                    hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."


                               LORA
                    Well, I meant -


                               GIBBS
                    Whereas actually, what we propose to
                    do is to turn something into nothing
                    and back again. So you might just as
                    well have said, "Here goes something
                    and here comes nothing." Hah?


         They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
         cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
         polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
         laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
         plat-form -- empty.


                               LORA
                    Let me make sure we're running


         She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
         connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.


         Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
         console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
         the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
         close enough to watch.


    74   ANGLE - LORA                                                 74


         She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.


                               LORA
                    Looks good...


                               GIBBS (O.S.)


                    Let 'er rip...


    75   LASER LAB - AS BEFORE                                        75


         The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
         sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
         received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
         it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
         the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
         discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
         film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
         five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
         rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.


                               GIBBS
                             (quietly)
                    Perfect.


         At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
         and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
         shoe-covers, walking toward them.


                               ALAN
                    Beautiful!


                               GIBBS
                    Hello, Alan.


                               ALAN
                    Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
                    all day, and you guys are down here
                    disintegrating things and having fun.


         He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.


                               GIBBS
                    Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
                    While the laser is dismantling the
                    molecular structure of the object,
                    the computer maps out a holographic
                    model of it. The molecules themselves
                    are suspended in the laser beam. Then
                    the computer reads the model back out,
                    the molecules go back into place, and...
                          (indicates ball)
                    voila.

                               ALAN
                    Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?


                               GIBBS
                    Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
                    and you must purchase your program
                    at least 30 days in advance. Hah!


         The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with
         their arms around each other's shoulders.


                               LORA
                    How's it going upstairs?


                               ALAN
                    Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
                    to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
                    with Group 7 access out of the system.


         Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.


                               ALAN
                           (continuing)
                     Ever since he got that Master Control
                     Program set up, system's got more bugs
                     than a bait store.


                               GIBBS
                    Well, you have to expect some static.
                    Computers are just machines after all,
                    they can't think...


                               ALAN
                    They'll start to soon enough.


                               GIBBS
                              (wryly)
                    Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
                    will start thinking, and people will
                    stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
                    data through. See you tomorrow.


         AD LIB goodnights.

         outside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the
         protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off

                    Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not
                    interested in talking about him.


                               LORA
                    Oh, I wish you'd forget about that.
                    It was all so long ago. I've totally
                    gotten over it.

         walking through the aisle of games, from behind. They are slightly
         bewildered and confused by the weird noises. Lora approaches a
         junior high school girl who's watching a hot game of "Battle Zone."

         The kid looks at Lora, then turns towards the center of the room
         and points. Alan and Lora look.

         playing a game called Space Paranoids, CAMERA TILTING UP into his
         face, catching the orange glow from the console.


         The game has a prominent ICOM logo under the screen. Flynn is a
         cocky kid in his mid-20s, unshaven, wearing a T-shirt, jeans,
         jogging shoes. He's racked up a terrific score.

         Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans.
         As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to
         999,999,999 -- then flashes the word "RECORD" as lights blink and
         a SIREN sounds. The kids cheer wildly.


                               FLYNN
                    It's all in the wrist, friends.


         He grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find Lora

         favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade
         noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans
         against a game, nervous; Lora paces.

                    terminal, tries to read up his file,
                    and ... nothing. A big blank. We now
                    take you to three months later.
                    Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
                    video games he has "invented" -- the
                    slime didn't even change the names --
                    and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus
                    begins his meteoric rise to...what is
                    he now, Executive V.P.?


                               ALAN
                    Senior exec.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight
                    million quarters a week in Space Paranoids
                    machines and I'm not seeing one dime.


                               ALAN
                    I still don't get why you're trying to
                    break into the system.


                               FLYNN
                    Because somewhere... in one of those
                    memories ... is the evidence. If I got in
                    far enough, I could reconstruct it.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    My password ... Dillinger's instruction to
                    divert the data ...


                               LORA
                    I'm afraid it's a little late for that.
                    Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must
                    know what you're up to.


                               FLYNN
                    Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.


                               ALAN
                    Dillinger?


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.
                    Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.
                    Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,
                    runnin' things from on high..


                               LORA
                    Don't even say that. You've got to find that
                    file before he does..


                               FLYNN
                    Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just
                    slip it into another system as soon as it
                    locates it...


                               ALAN
                    Not if my Tron program was running. That
                    would seal the system off. If your file's in
                    there...


                               FLYNN
                    Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge
                    us a Group 6 access...


         They all look at each other. After a beat, Lora holds the keys
         to her van aloft.


                               LORA
                    Shall we dance?

    101  DILLINGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   101


    Dillinger is seated at his computer-console desk. Gibbs, standing,
    faces him.


                               GIBBS
                    Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own
                    people can't get access to their
                    programs ... you know how frustrating
                    it is, when you're working on a piece
                    of research -


                               DILLINGER
                    Walter, I sympathize, but I have data
                    coming out of the Master Control Program
                    saying there is something screwy --

                               GIBBS
                    That MCP, you know, that's half the
                    problem right --


                               DILLINGER
                    The MCP is the most efficient way of
                    handling what we do. I can't sit and
                    worry about every little user request that --


                               GIBBS
                    User requests are what computers are for.


                               DILLINGER
                    Doing our business is what computers are
                    for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM
                    isn't the business you started in your garage
                    anymore --


         As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board,
         and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast
         computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning
         in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
         millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
         computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
         Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth
         adding up, accounts receivable and assets.


                               DILLINGER (CONT.)
                    We're billing accounts in 30 countries,
                    we've got one of the largest systems in
                    existence...


         Gibbs turns wearily away from the display.


                               GIBBS
                    Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I
                    was back in that garage...


                               DILLINGER
                    It can be arranged...


         Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again.


                               GIBBS
                    That was uncalled-for.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately...
                    you feel like going for a drink?


                               GIBBS
                    Thank you, no. I have some work to do...
                    assuming I can still log on.


         He exits.


    102  EXT. ICOM BUILDING - NIGHT                                   102


         Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from ICOM's
         main gate. The ICOM building looms high above them, an ominous box.

         A digital CLOCK on the dashboard reads 12:12. Lora is at the wheel,
         Alan next to her.


                               LORA
                    You better get in back with Flynn.
                    And keep down.


         She jerks her thumb over her shoulder.


                               ALAN
                    Do I gotta?


         But he climbs over the seat, and Lora starts to drive slowly forward.


    103  CLOSE ON FLYNN AND ALAN                                      103

                    Hi, Flynn.


         Flynn pulls a bag of doughnuts from his pocket.


                               FLYNN
                            (explaining)
                    My dinner.


                               ALAN
                    I was wondering where you got that
                    glow of good health.


                               FLYNN
                    Want one?


                               ALAN
                    Uh... got any cinnamon?


         Flynn smiles, hands Alan a doughnut.


                               LORA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Keep it down, you guys.


    104  EXT. ICOM - THE GIGANTIC SECURITY ENTRANCE - NIGHT           104


         Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the ICOM
         building, and the three get out. Lora inserts her I.D. card into a
         magnetic reader beside the door. Nothing happens.


                               LORA
                    I don't think I'm cleared for this.


                               ALAN
                    I'm certainly not.


                               FLYNN
                    Move aside. Let the kid have some room.

         He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black
         box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with LED numerals
         and a small calculator keyboard. He leans over the security lock,
         his BACK TO THE CAMERA and PLAYS a couple of notes. There's a
         distinct CLICK, an the door starts to swing open ... and open ...
         and open. We see that this door is about twenty feet thick. Flynn
         starts LAUGHING.


    105  INT. A CORRIDOR                                              105


         The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to
         nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall.
         But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them.


                               LORA
                    Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at
                    my terminal, down in the laser lab.
                    We'll be up in Alan's office.


                               FLYNN
                    Swell...I'll log us both on, and you
                    can get your Tron thing running...


                               LORA
                    As long as we stay off the top floor,
                    Dillinger'll never know we've been in
                    here...

         of the laser lab. We see Flynn's face peek out and see the camera.
         His head pulls back in.


    113  SHOT OF HALLWAY                                              113

         make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching.

         approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
         his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
         camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,

         silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice.


         We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it
         is this section that is being activated.

                    problems throw you like that? C'mon,
                    big boy, let's see what...


                               MCP
                    You're entering a big error, Flynn...
                    I'm going to have to put you on the
                    Game Grid.


                               FLYNN
                    Games, huh? I'll give you --


         Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
         behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
         freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
         a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
         ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
         being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
         with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
         blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    129  THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one      129
         we saw at the opening of the film'.


         The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
         rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
         getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
         glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
         covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
         closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
         with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
         angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
         deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
         an internal energy.


         We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
         structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
         and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
         everything blurring with the speed.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    130  ELECTRONIC WORLD - A TUNNEL                                  130


         made up of rings of energy, and we are diving straight down it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    131  THIS TUNNEL                                                  131


         We see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the
         outside, and suddenly we're at the bottom, and the figure stops,
         staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.


                                                   CUT TO:


    132  SHOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL                             132


         We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now
         covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry,
         glowing with energy. Flynn shakes his head dazedly.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only
                    thinks it's happening...


         He looks up and SEES something.


    133  FLYNN'S POV                                                  133


         A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff,
         is right in front of him. This character reaches out an arm and
         grabs Flynn.

         being dragged off the entry tube platform.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is
                    about those parking tickets, I can
                    explain everything...


    135  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           135


         hovering over the Game Grid. We see Sark in his feet sockets, his
         hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE
         fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering
         into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the
         cylinder of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.


         Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the MCP.


                               SARK
                            (hoarsely)
                    Yes, MCP.


                               MCP
                    I've got a little challenge for you, Sark --
                    a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I
                    want him treated in the usual manner. Train
                    him for the games... let him hope for a
                    while... and blow him away.


                               SARK
                    You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send
                    me somebody with a little moxie ... what
                    kind of program is he?


                               MCP
                    He's not any kind of program, Sark.
                    He's a User.


         Sark looks up, shocked.


                               SARK
                    A User?


                               MCP
                    That's right. He pushed me...in the
                    other world. Somebody pushes me, I push
                    back. So I brought him down here ...
                    What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.



                               SARK
                    Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,
                    a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User
                    even wrote you...


                               MCP
                    Now get this straight, pal -- no one
                    User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million
                    of their man-years! I'm bigger than all
                    those little wimps put together!
                            (disgust)
                    Humans they can't even keen their social
                    order in one piece

                               SARK
                    But-what if I can't...?


                               MCP
                    You rather take your chances with me?
                    Want me to slow down your power cycles
                    for you?


         The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken.


                               SARK
                    Wait...I need that...


                               MCP
                    Then pull yourself together. Get this
                    clown trained. I want him in the Games
                    until he dies playing.

                    Acknowledge.


                               SARK
                             (weakly)
                    Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...


                               MCP
                    End of line.


         The hologram disappears and Sark's power returns.

         Two guards leading Flynn down it, ECHOING FOOTSTEPS.


         They turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a
         cell. The door opens automatically. Flynn holds back.


                               GUARD
                    Video Game Unit #18. In here, program.

                    Who you callin' "program," program?


         The guard shoves Flynn inside and SLAMS the door, cutting off his
         voice.

         The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence.
         Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands.


    138  HIS POV                                                      138


         Flynn's hands are glowing, electrified.

         of his face. His head comes up and we see an expression of terrible
         understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening
         of the neighboring cell.


    140  INT. NEXT CELL - RAM'S                                       140


         Ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from Tron's.

         He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back,
         so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Who are you guys?
                    What's the story around here?


         But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
         it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
         come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
         disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.

         turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.


                               RAM
                    You want to watch those force fields...


         He goes to the window opening.

                    You'll be having plenty of chances to
                    get hurt, don't worry about that.

                    Where am I?

                    Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play
                    video games better than anybody.


         Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything,
         there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell
         opens.

         we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as
         Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the
         opposite direction.

         A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with
         balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier
         hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new
         captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They
         pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of

    176  1. SHOT OF FLYNN, held immobile while a laser scans          176
            his mouth.


    177  2. A LINE OF RECRUITS files past a checkpoint. Each          177
            is handed a disk.

    178  3. THE RECRUITS file out into a training area.               178

    179  4. We see AN ARM being fitted with a cesta.                  179

    180  5. ONE of the more experienced CONSCRIPTS, RAM,              180
            demonstrates the throw with the cesta.


    181  6. FLYNN tries an awkward throw. In the b.g. other           181
            recruits are practicing.


    182  7. RAM instructs Flynn. Flynn is getting better. He          182
            spins and catches a pellet.


    183  8. A demonstration of the DISK GAME by two other warriors.   183

    184  9. FLYNN practices a ricochet shot at a target --            184
            hits perfectly.


            END MONTAGE


    185  FLYNN BACK IN HIS CELL                                       185


         for a rest period. He is pacing back and forth, and we can see Ram
         seated in the next cell. Flynn goes to the bars.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey, Ram ... what were you ...
                    you know, before?


                               RAM
                           (nostalgic,
                            brightens)
                    Oh, I was an actuarial program...
                    worked at a big insurance company.
                    It really gives you a great feeling,
                    helping folks plan for their future
                    needs -- and of course, if you look
                    at the payments as an annuity, over
                    the years, the cost is really


                               FLYNN
                             (about to
                             get bored)
                    Yeah, yeah -- that's great.


                               RAM
                    How 'bout yourself?


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...


                               RAM
                              (nods)
                    Sure, a little disorientation. That's
                    normal, when they transport you. It'll
                    come back to you. You're doing real
                    well in training. Remarkable, really...


         The POUNDING on Flynn's cell begins again.


    187  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           187


         We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's
         console. Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous,
         frightened of this new User-warrior.


                               SARK
                         (over his shoulder)
                    Wait a minute...put this guy against
                    one of the other recruits.


    188  OMIT                                                         188

    189  A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM                       189


         We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
         bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
         circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
         marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
         When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
         We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
         and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
         looks over at Crom, who's anxious.


                               FLYNN
                    Looks like we're in the same boat here -


                               CROM
                              (jumpy)
                    You think you're gonna wipe me right
                    out, don't you?


                               FLYNN
                    No, I


         A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
         upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
         straight for Flynn.


         Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
         his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
         right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
         himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.


    190  FLYNN'S POV - DOWN                                           190

         down, down between the rings into an infinite pit.


    191  BACK TO FLYNN                                                191

         staring down. There's a SOUND and he looks up.

    192  HIS POV                                                      192


         Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


    193  FLYNN                                                        193


         reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther
         edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and
         catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back.


    194  CROM                                                         194


         Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains,
         but misses. One of his rings disappears.

    195  FLYNN reacting                                               195


                               FLYNN
                       (happy he's scored)
                    Okay!

    196  SARK'S AIRCRAFT CARRIER - THE BRIDGE                         196

         High above the game we see Sark watching.


    197  FLYNN                                                        197


         racing for another catch. He makes it and hurls the pellet again.
         We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast.


    198  OMIT                                                         198

    199  THE GAME IN PROGRESS                                         199


                               FLYNN
                    Here's an easy one...


         Flynn throws again. The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads
         straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he
         was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of
         the next ring to keep from falling.


 200-201 OMIT                                                         200-201


    202  FLYNN                                                        202


         He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it
         ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring.


    203  SARK                                                         203


         His face lit from below by the glow of the Game Grid... angry


    204  FLYNN                                                        204


         He puts down his cesta. Suddenly a voice rings out from above.
         Flynn looks up. There, appearing in the mirror disk above, is Sark's
         face, furious, huge.


                               SARK
                    Finish the game!


    205  FLYNN                                                        205


         staring at this apparition. He grits his teeth.


                               FLYNN
                            (shouts up)
                    No!


    205A REAL WORLD - A BUS STATION                                   205A


         In a Greyhound station waiting area, two kids are playing a video
         game, which appears to have broken down.


                               KID
                    What's wrong with it?


                               KID 2
                    I don't know... on the blink
                    or something... damn.

    205B ELECTRONIC WORLD - FLYNN, SARK, ETC. AS BEFORE               205B


                               SARK
                    Kill him!!!


         Flynn holds up the pellet... and drops it down into the abyss below.
         He stares back up at Sark's immense image.


                               FLYNN
                    No!


    206  SARK'S HUGE REFLECTED IMAGE                                  206


         in the mirror platform, towering above Flynn.


                               SARK
                    You'll regret this.

    207  SARK'S FINGER                                                207


         pressing a button.


    208  CROM                                                         208


         The ring he is holding on to dissolves, and with a SCREAM, he
         falls... and falls ... and falls...


    209  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        209

         with Flynn visible, staring down, and the huge face of Sark above
         him.

    210  SARK                                                         210


         on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost
         presses it... We see him-straining, trying to overcome his
         conditioning. Then he snatches his hand away.


                               SARK
                           (looking up)
                    No! You said he could die in the games

    211  FLYNN                                                        211

         staring up. The image on the mirror wavers and dissolves.


    212  SARK                                                         212


         He SLAMS his palm down on a panel on the console, and a BUZZER
         SOUNDS.


    213  FLYNN                                                        213


         as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting
         to run across to him.


    214  RAM AND TRON                                                 214


         The sound of GUARDS' running feet approaching their cells. They look
         up.


    215  A CORRIDOR IN THE GAME AREA                                  215


         Flynn is being escorted down it. A couple of big Blue Warriors go by
         and deliberately brush into Flynn.

                               WARRIOR
                          (turning on Flynn,
                              snarling)
                    Outta  my way, rookie.


         Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back
         and pulls out his disk.


                               FLYNN
                    Out of my way, zero bit.


         He moves as if to throw the disk.


                               WARRIOR
                            (backing away)
                    Sure, sure ... just kiddin'.


         The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as
         Flynn and his guards continue on.


    216  THE HOLDING AREA FOR THE LIGHT CYCLE GAME                    216


         Ram and Tron are escorted in as Flynn is brought in from another
         corridor. Three blue warriors are lined up, waiting.


                               RAM
                    Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!


                               FLYNN
                         (under his breath)
                    Tron...?


         He leans over to get a better look at Tron and GASPS in surprise.

                               FLYNN
                    Alan!

                               TRON
                            (frowning)
                    Where did you hear that name?


                               FLYNN
                    Well, isn't it -- ?


                               TRON
                    The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?


                               FLYNN
                          (thinking fast)
                    I, uh... I'm a program from a User
                    that... knows Alan...?


                               RAM
                    He was disoriented in transport, Tron.


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of
                    stuff. Like...my User wants me to go
                    after the MCP


         Before they can go on, the BUZZER sounds.


                                                   CUT TO:


    217  LONG SHOT OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                            217


         floating over the Game Grid, with a view of the light cycle arena.
         ZOOM IN on the section of the grid where the game is about to start.


    218  A SHOT FROM ABOVE                                            218


         The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite
         sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by
         high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier
         hovering high overhead.


    219  CLOSE ON TRON                                                219


                               TRON
                    That's what my User wants, too...


    220  SHOT OF THE THREE FRIENDS                                    220


         holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. We see Tron
         and Ram looking at Flynn, in the center.


                               FLYNN
                    I know...


    221  CLOSE SHOT - FLYNN                                           221


         With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed
         around him.


    222  SHOT OF THE THREE BLUE CYCLES                                222


         ready to go.


    223  SHOT OF THE THREE CONSCRIPT CYCLES                           223


         also ready.


    224  SARK                                                         224


         His finger presses a button and the BUZZER SOUNDS again.


    225  SHOT FROM ABOVE OF ALL CYCLES TAKING OFF                     225


         We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. As we
         watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron
         and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other:


    226  OMIT                                                         226


    227  TRON'S POV                                                   227


         of the other cycle heading straight at him.


    228  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              228


         We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both
         turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing
         forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the
         arena.


                               FLYNN'S VOICE
                                (into mike)
                    Nice one!


    229  SHOT OF TRON AND HIS OPPONENT                                229


         They start making turns, passing walls they have already created,
         each trying to box the other in.


                               TRON'S VOICE

    230  CLOSE SHOT FROM THE SIDE - TRON                              230

         rushing forward.


    231  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           231

         turning.

                               RAM'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    I've got control. Go ahead.


    232  SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON'S CYCLE                           232


    233  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              233

         They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of
         the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the
         inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall.
         There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in
         the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
         dissolve as he does.

    234  SHOT OF FLYNN                                                234

         rushing alongside his opponent. They make a turn.

         They make another turn


    237  SHOT OF TWO CYCLES RUSHING                                   237

         right at the camera.


    238  FLYNN'S POV                                                  238

         of the maze of walls. He gets clear for a moment and spots the crack
         in the bulwark.

    239  CLOSE UP - HIS FACE                                          239

         reacting, getting an idea.

                    You guys...follow me.


    240  SHOT OF THE TWO CYCLES                                       240


         racing together, approaching the bulwark. At the last second, the
         Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack.


    241  SARK                                                         241


         observing this. With satisfaction. Now he will be rid of the User.


    242  FLYNN                                                        242


         He races straight at the crack... and through it.


    243  SARK                                                         243


         His face suffused with anger. He SLAMS a fist down on the console
         in front of him.


    244  LONG SHOT OF THE GRID                                        244


         The remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena.


    245  CLOSE UP - TRON                                              245


         reacting to Flynn's escape, hope in his eyes.


    246  ANGLE ON RAM                                                 246


         SMASHING another one of the Blue Warriors against a wall. He turns
         and races up next to Tron.


    247  SHOT OF THEM                                                 247


         side by side. They look at each other.

                    Do it!


    248  LONG SHOT                                                    248


         We see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We
         HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up:


                               VOICE
                      (through loudspeaker)
                    WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID.
                    REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE
                    GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING.


         We continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually
         diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies
         out altogether.

    249  SHOT OF TWO RECOGNIZERS                                      249

         moving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it.

    250  SHOT OF THE THREE ESCAPING CYCLES                            250


         racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room
         to get by. They emerge into an open corridor, with the Recognizers
         appearing overhead. We watch the cycles rush past the CAMERA...

    251  SARK                                                         251


         He is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out
         of his way.


                               SARK
                    Get them. Send out every Game
                    Tank in the Grid! Get them!

    252  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        252


         as he looks up and spots the Recognizers hovering over them, about
         to come down for the kill.

    252A SHOT OF RAM                                                  252


         heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "Game Storage."

    253  SHOT FROM BEHIND                                             253

         as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked,
         way too big to fit through the opening.

    254  INT. WEAPONS STORAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS                       254


         FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with
         rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks
         REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes,
         and follow.


    255  EXT. MAZE                                                    255


         Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand
         Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with
         narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the
         ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come
         around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the
         face of the cliff. They stop for a moment.

    256  CLOSE UP - TRON'S FACE                                       256

         listening.

    257  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              257

         as the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the
         narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing
         from view.

    258  INT. OF THE CAVE                                             258


         We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
         darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a
         stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars
         between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh man...when you're on the other side
                    of the screen...it all looks so easy...


         Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and
         grinning, until all three are LAUGHING.


    259  DESERT LABYRINTH                                             259


         as the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft
         carrier hovering overhead.


    260  BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                               260


         Sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape.


                               SARK
                       (to one of the bridge
                            personnel)
                    Get the pursuit force back into 404A.
                    There's no place else they could be...


         Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark,
         where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible,
         moving through it. He turns to Sark.


                               LIEUTENANT
                              (confidently)
                    We'll have them in no time, sir. Long
                    before the interrupt interface.


                               SARK
                         (whirls on him)
                    We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if
                    the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
                    I want those programs!


    261  INT. CAVE                                                    261


         Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the
         cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a
         cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising
         from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.


                               FLYNN
                           (looking out)
                    It's all circuits...
                         (points at tower)
                    Must be an input/output component...


                               RAM
                    The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
                    remembered anything else about
                    yourself -- like what sector you're
                    from?


                               FLYNN
                           (sitting down
                          against a rock)
                    Well...my home "sector" was called
                    Paramus ...


                               RAM
                           (sits also)
                    PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
                    stand for ... (starts counting them
                    off on his fingers) ...probably Program
                    Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
                    a lovely place.


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    It grows on you.


         He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is
         gazing upwards.


                               TRON
                            (murmuring)
                    I can feel it ...


         Flynn and Ram turn.


                               FLYNN
                    Feel what? You okay?


                               RAM
                    Alan-One...


                               TRON
                    Yes... he's got something to tell me...


         Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.


                               RAM
                    You think we can make it there?


                               TRON
                    We have to.


                               FLYNN
                      (pointing to a corner
                           of the cave)
                    Hey, what's that?


         They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream
         can just be seen. Ram gets up.


                               RAM
                    it's just what we need.


    262  INT. NICHE                                                   262


         Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing,
         brilliant LIGHT.


                               TRON
                    Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
                    good fresh energy feels, till you get
                    to a pure source...
                            (to Flynn)
                    Have some...you'll need it.


         Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.


                               FLYNN
                         (wiping his mouth)
                    well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
                    Master Control?


         Tron and Ram are taken aback.


                               TRON
                    What, just the three of us?


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    You know anybody that's got an army for
                    rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
                    to go take that sucker out. An' let's
                    face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
                    weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
                    while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
                    what does he care whether you guys get
                    killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
                    quarters?


                               RAM
                            (to Tron)
                    Do you know what he's talking about?


                               TRON
                            (to Flynn)
                    I have to find out what Alan wants...
                    that comes first.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
                    what to -


         Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    What's that?


                               TRON
                    Tanks...coming back. Let's go.


         With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the
         men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back
         into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.


 263-265 OMIT                                                         263-265

         The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible
         avenues of escape in the terrain below.


                               FLYNN
                              (points)
                    How about over there...that empty
                    memory?


                               TRON
                           (shakes head)
                    No good...they might block off the
                    old chip.
                             (points)
                    This way.


         The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
         the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
         EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.

         from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow
         arroyo.


    268  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           268


         They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
         entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
         narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
         to the edge of a gaping ravine.


         Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
         ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
         to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                    The bridge! Come on!


         The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,
         lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all
         three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
         turning the corner.

         Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches
         the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
         tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
         him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
         and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
         SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.


         He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
         below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.


         The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
         speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.

         Ram is badly injured, unconscious. Flynn struggles to his feet,
         sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him
         up.

         in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen
         behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from
         the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been
         blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his
         lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.

         speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for
         the cityscape tower in the distance.

    277  SHOT IN FRONT OF HIM - HIS FACE                              277

         Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously
         moving in his direction.

    278  FLYNN AND RAM                                                278


         Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is
         getting darker.


                               FLYNN
                    You gonna make it?


         Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
         lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
         leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
         out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.


                                                   CUT TO:

         arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening.
         Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening
         and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.

    280  FLYNN AND RAM                                                280


         sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing. Ram is unconscious
         anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.


                                                   FADE TO BLACK:
    281  FADE UP FROM BLACK                                           281


         Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a
         platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone.
         Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but
         then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn
         looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards
         the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy
         glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving
         it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and
         RUMBLE.


                               FLYNN
                           (holding onto
                             the wall)
                    What's goin' on?


                               RAM
                      (looking around, weak)
                    We're inside a Recognizer...
                            (to Flynn)
                    You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --


                               FLYNN
                       (stumbling, trying to
                         keep his balance)
                    Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -


         Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the
         instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and
         shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and
         Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright
         position.

    283  INT. RECOGNIZER                                              283


         Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.


         Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
         going fast.


                               FLYNN
                    You okay? You don't look so good.


         Ram nods weakly.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Hang on. We'll get you outta here.


         Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
         no result.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Damn! Never fails... minute the
                    warranty runs out...


                               RAM
                    Come here.


         Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
         Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
         Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... !


                               RAM
                    Little more juice's all it needs...


         Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
         Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
         but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
         gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    284  THE CITY LANDSCAPE                                           284


         Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
         landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
         rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
         NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.


    285  TRON'S POV                                                   285


         A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.

         He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
         figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
         it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
         figure, dissolving it.


    287  CLOSE UP TRON'S FACE                                         287


         Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
         figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
         Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
         at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
         head sadly, but walks on.


    288  TRON TURNS A CORNER                                          288


         Up ahead we see a large, multi-storied factory-like building.


    289  CLOSE UP - TRON IS FACE                                      289

         This is what he was looking for. He looks from side to side,
         figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the
         building stand a small group of the memory guards.

         This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
         sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
         then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
         One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
         gives a violent shake, then stops.


                               FLYNN
                    Never gonna figure out how to work
                    this thing...


         There's a NOISE from above. He looks up.

         His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
         to be still examining things.

         Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying
         to get a look at Flynn. The BIT.

         Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
         a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
         comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay -- hold it right there!


         The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
         recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
         sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:


                               BIT
                    Yes!


         The Bit subsides into energy form again.

                        (still suspicious)
                    What do you mean, "'yes"?


                               BIT
                    Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.


         From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character,
         red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops
         speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.


                               FLYNN
                    That all you can say?

         Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm your program?

                    chance know how to drive this crate?


         In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
         platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
         stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
         grabs the cross-bar.

         Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer,
         and it takes off like a bat out of hell

         into a wall and bouncing off another one.

         This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
         inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
         of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
         elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
         partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
         We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
         only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
         interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
         Tron looks farther down the corridor.

         We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards
         Tron.

         as he moves back against the wall, into a niche.


         As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
         grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
         The line of workers mechanically files on past.


         We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
         his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
         half-heartedly.


                               TRON
                    I'm not gonna hurt you.


         She stops struggling.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    I'm going to let you go now... don't
                    scream, or I'll be very sorry.


         His hands loosen, and he releases her.

         We see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first
         time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face,
         still beautiful in its pallor.


                               TRON
                    Put your hand behind your back.


         Slowly she obeys.

         He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is
         made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we
         watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into
         her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.


                               GIRL
                    TRON!!


         She throws her arms around him.

                           her tightly)

         She-looks around nervously.


                               YORI
                          (pulling him by
                             his hand)
                    This way. Come on.


         They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs.

         Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see
         the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings,
         and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they
         hear snatches of conversation.


                               PROGRAM
                    ...artillery for Video Game Sector...

                               YORI
                    I can't believe how bad it's gotten
                    around here since the MCP started
                    taking over... all the good functions
                    have shut down... everybody looks so dead...
                    I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...

                    That's all going to change, Yori...

                    in touch with Alan. He was going
                    to tell me how to


         Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls
         him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air.

         Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
         She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.

    314  INT. YORI'S APARTMENT                                        314


         As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
         window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
         looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
         walls and floors.

                               YORI
                    My quarters.

                               TRON
                    Why is everything...like this?


                               YORI
                    It's a flat. But wait a micro...


         She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
         a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
         the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
         three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
         charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
         the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
         aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.


    315  HIS POV                                                      315


         With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
         extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
         shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
         diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
         her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
         by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
         Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.


                               YORI
                    Come here.

         His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
         being fully rewarded for his efforts.


                               TRON
                    You're beautiful, Yori.

         as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
         flattened palms.


         Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
         glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.


                               YORI
                    You've grown, big program.


                               TRON
                    I had to...in the games...


         They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All
         the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto
         what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
         room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
         other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
         moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
         trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
         are enveloped in the cloud of stars...

         He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
         light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
         only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
         shouting:

         as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop... but the head of it,
         with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air,
         landing in what looks like a garbage dump.

         hovering over him.

         A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
         from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
         his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
         they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see
         him.

         Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
         the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear

                    I have to re-route the insurance

                    start the war game simulation for

                    receivable adjustment for Sark...
                    Certainly... the MCP wants only

    329  EXT. THE BASE OF THE I/0 TOWER                               329


         It looms high overhead.


    330  TRON AND YORI                                                330


         on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
         approaching a wide door in the wall.


    331  INSIDE THIS DOOR'                                            331


         We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
         rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
         and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.


    332  SHOT FROM BELOW THEM                                         332

         looking upwards as they move.

    333  THE UPPER FLOOR                                              333


         as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
         sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
         dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
         preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
         the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
         sharp, angular surfaces.  On this second story there is floor and
         ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
         and beyond.


         Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
         a door into the inner parts of the Tower.

    350  THE CENTRAL CHAMBER                                          350


         of the I/0 Tower. A large, raised circular altar stands against one
         wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
         supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.


         In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
         steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
         suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
         priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
         still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
         from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
         opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
         each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
         upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
         only blackness beyond.


    351  DUMONT'S FACE                                                351

         asleep.

    352  REVERSE ANGLE                                                352


         Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide
         room, their footsteps ECHOING.

    375  CENTRAL CHAMBER - TRON, YORI, DUMONT                         375

         Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.


                               YORI
                             (quietly)
                    Dumont... ?


         The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't
         recognize either one.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes?


                               TRON
                             (nervous)
                    I... have come to communicate with
                    my User.


                               DUMONT
                    Hmm. A difficult proposition...
                    difficult proposition at best.
                       (indicates empty chamber)
                    Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
                    exactly packing them in these days ...


                               YORI
                    Yes...what--?


                               DUMONT
                    You know, not so long ago, you
                    could've come in here and seen
                    programs lined up all the way back
                    to those doors, waiting for communion
                    with their Users. The building fund
                    was doing well too...but now...
                               (sighs)
                    ...this so-called Master Control
                    Program is going around cutting
                    programs off from their natural
                    creators, grabbing all our believers
                    and making them ride around on little
                    motor scooters and shoot things at
                    each other and Weiner knows what all--
                    oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
                    of faith...


                               TRON
                    Well I want to communicate --

                               DUMONT
                    Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
                    get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
                    you in here. They hate this tower.
                    They'd close it down if they dared
                    to but they keep me around, in case
                    one of them wants to deal with the
                    other world once in a while. And
                    you should hear the way they commune!
                    Sounds like they were routing a
                    payroll, for all the heart they put
                    in it. No, I don't think you


         Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.


                               TRON
                    Dumont... my User has information
                    that could -- could make this a
                    free system again.


                               DUMONT
                    Hah.


                               TRON
                    Really. You'd have programs lined
                    up around the block to use this
                    place -- and no MCP looking over your
                    shoulder.


                               DUMONT
                               (sighs)
                    When you've been in the system as long
                    as I have, you hear many promises...
                    many reassurances...many brave plans...


         He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:


                               DUMONT (CONT.)
                           (falling into ritual)
                    Who is your User, program?


                               TRON
                    Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?


                               DUMONT
                    All that is visible must grow beyond
                    itself and extend into the realm of
                    the invisible.


         Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.


                               DUMONT
                    You may pass, my friend.


         Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness
         beyond.

         We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring
         curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets.

    377  A CORRIDOR IN THE TOWER. A CORNER.                           377


         We see a face peer around it. Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    This is where Tron said he was going...


         Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
         the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
         down the hall, Bit following.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Looks like his kind of place, too...
                    real serious.


         CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR
         the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the
         corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.

         Sark... and a force of guards and six Blue Warriors. Sark is in
         front, enjoyment on his face. As far as he's concerned he's just
         going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is
         trapped.


                               GUARDS

         seen. Sark marches TOWARDS THE CAMERA, right into it.

         The file of men is moving away. We can see that there is a wide ledge
         about ten feet up the wall, containing the lighting source.

         lifting his staff.

         We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning
         over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn
         places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue
         static pattern covering the guard flows into Flynn's hands up his
         arms, and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes.

         We see that he is standing in front of the huge, closed door to the
         I/0 Tower central chamber. The guards have formed two long rows, and
         Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side.


                               SARK
                    That old fruitcake Dumont...
                    he'll pay for this.

    392  THE HEART OF THE TOWER                                       392


         We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
         golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
         surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
         Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.


    393  INT. COMMUNICATION BELL                                      393


         Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
         which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
         sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
         surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
         this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
         within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
         down, and then up.


    394  HIS POV                                                      394


         The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening.


    395  FROM THE OPENING                                             395


         We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
         into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
         inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
         above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
         his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
         knowledge of the experience to come.


    396  A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP.            396


         He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
         high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
         happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
         light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
         illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
         force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped

         hands drop to his sides. The disk rises out of sight, and we

    399  EXT. CENTRAL CHAMBER - DOOR                                  399


         A machine, floating above the floor, with a pointed cone facing the
         door, is switched on, and a blast of pure electricity leaps from it
         to the surface of the door with the SOUND of sizzling LIGHTNING

         Tron is looking upwards. Suddenly a voice booms out, echoing, and
         distorted, Alan's voice.


                               ALAN V.0.
                    TRON... TRON... Location query...

                    There you are... look, before we get
                    cut off again...


         In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting,
         transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light
         at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
         bright light at the center.


         We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the
         others dim.


                               ALAN (V.0.)

         The light increases in brilliance, as we hear Alan's voice fading out,
         consumed by static.

         He stops.


         The voice is gone. The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and
         gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It
         slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it,
         pulls it down and stares at it.

         It is glowing with a new power. Superimposed on its surface is a
         complex mandala pattern, changing kaleidoscopically as we watch,
         shifting swirling liquid color.

         entry to the Communication chamber.

         He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the
         neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he
         has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming
         winglike supports for the fabric.


                               DUMONT
                    I have waited for this moment many
                    thousands of cycles. It is time for the
                    new order to begin... The Users are
                    waiting.


         As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly.
         Then he holds out his hand to Yori.

         of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots
         of light.

         Sark.

         Yori. The guards spread out through the room, Sark strides towards
         Dumont.

                    This way...there's a simulation
                    we can use...


         And we see them race towards it.

    419  A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER, RISING WITH TRON         419
         AND YORI

         We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
         designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
         enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
         move with the speed of light.  The sail is at the bow of the craft,
         and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
         made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
         look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
         transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
         information paths to the Central Processing Unit.

                               TRON V.O.
                    Can it carry us?

                    The design is good... We don't know
                    why the User abandoned the project...


         The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center,
         forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked
         into place.


    420  SHOT OF THEM FROM THE LONG WALKWAY, FACING THE STERN         420


         We see Yori bending over a console of touch panels.

                    Yes...it can take us across the
                    Sea of Simulation... all the way
                    out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.

         Bending over the console, from the POV of the sail. As we watch, a
         head leans into the frame from the right. A memory guard. Then we
         see a hand gripping a staff, and the legs of another guard on the
         left.


                                                   CUT TO:

         On the console, as Yori leans over it. We see that she is looking at
         a map of the system, a flat grid, and on it, in miniature, are the
         beam transfer points and transmission location.

         silently. We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise. His head snaps
         up; he sees the guards.


                               TRON
                    Yori! Get down!

         Abandoning any attempt at silence, leap forward, shouting, thrusting
         their staffs at Tron.

         ring the hangar walls. They start swarming up.

         stop, letting them come.

         starting to rise.

    432  TRON                                                         432


         throwing his disk. It smashes into the guards in front, tossing them
         backwards.

    433  A SHOT FROM THE EXTERIOR OF THE HANGAR                       433


         The great door is almost all the way up. We can see the Sail with
         its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are
         racing towards the hangar.


    434  TRON                                                         434


         Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
         We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
         connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
         guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
         There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
         his balance.


    435  YORI                                                         435


         smiling.

                    We're off!

         The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,
         from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that
         it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
         accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
         seconds.


    437  EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - BRIDGE - SARK & MCP                  437

         Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In
         front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and
         the Solar Sailer -- racing away.


                               MCP
                    I hope you've enjoyed being a command
                    program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
                    working in a pocket calculator... maybe
                    one of those watches that plays "Happy
                    Birthday" to its User once a year.


                               SARK
                    Now, sir... We did take care of that
                    User you sent us --


                               MCP
                    Yes, and now you've got two renegade
                    programs running all the hell over the
                    system in a stolen simulation.


                               SARK
                    We'll get them, sir... These things
                    take time.


                               MCP
                    I don't have time, Sark. And neither
                    do you. End of line.

    440  SOLAR SAILER - WALKWAY - TRON                                440


         from the stern. Tron picks himself up from the floor where he was
         thrown when the Sailer took off, and heads for Yori (at the camera).
         He stops, seeing something.


                               YORI V.O.
                    Tron, are you all right?


         Tron waves at her... then...


    441  CLOSE SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON                             441


         He looks over at the guard rail.

         Several yards away from it. We see one of the blue warriors hanging
         on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the
         edge, look over and see this guard.


    444  CLOSE SHOT OF TRON                                           444


         By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot. Tron raises his
         disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing
         shape comes into the frame from bottom right.


                               BIT
                      (buzzing around Tron's
                         head like a fly)
                    No way, not on your life, no siree!!
                    Nothing doing, forget it!!!

                               TRON
                    Flynn!!


    447  SIDE SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                       447


                               FLYNN
                    Greetings, program...


                               TRON
                           (dumbfounded)
                    You're alive!


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, I... oops!


         He loses his grip, and starts to fall. But Tron, just in time, grabs
         Flynn's wrist and starts to pull him up. We see the blue static guard
         disguise fade off Flynn.


    449  YORI                                                         449

         leaning over the control console anxiously, watching Tron come up
         the steps towards her with Flynn and the Bit.

                               YORI
                            (nervously)
                    Who is this?


         We see Flynn look at Yori and silently mouth "Lora" in surprise...
         but then realize his mistake.


                               TRON
                             (smiling)
                    Flynn...
                           (he turns to
                          Flynn eagerly)
                    Where's Ram?


                               FLYNN
                    I'm sorry, Tron... he's...
                    he didn't make it.


         Tron shakes his head, sadly.


                               TRON
                             (to Yori)
                    This is Flynn... the one who
                    busted me out.


                               YORI
                            (to Flynn)
                    Then I owe you some thanks...


                               FLYNN
                    No big deal. I ought to know my way
                    around that Light Cycles routine...
                    I mean, I did write the program for it.


                               TRON
                            (mystified)
                    Wrote the...?


                               FLYNN
                    It's time I levelled with you, Tron.
                    I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a
                    User.


         Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.


                               YORI
                    A User -- in our world?


                               FLYNN
                               (nods)
                    Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...


                               TRON
                    But -- if you're a User -- then
                    everything you've done has been
                    part of a plan ...


                               FLYNN
                              (laughs)
                    You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
                    to think since I got down here. I mean
                    in here. Out here. Whatever.


                               TRON
                    Then...


                               FLYNN
                    Look, you guys know how it is. You just
                    keep doin' what it looks like you're
                    supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
                    you hope to hell your User knows what's
                    goin' on.


                               TRON
                    Well -- that's how it is for programs,
                    yes, but --


                               FLYNN
                    I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the
                    time, that's how it is for Users, too.


                               TRON
                    Stranger and stranger...


                               BIT
                    You said it.


                               FLYNN
                        (pats Tron on back)
                    So... Nice ship you got here. What's our
                    next move?


                               TRON
                             (smiles)
                    Remember you wanted to pay a call on
                    the MCP?


         Flynn nods.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    We're on our way.
                             (indicates disk)
                    Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go
                    up against Master

                               FLYNN
                    All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake,
                    at least.

         The aircraft carrier rolls past the camera.

    452  THE BRIDGE - SARK                                            452


         looking out the observation window, as his lieutenant approaches
         from behind.

                               LIEUTENANT
                    Sir, what do you want done with
                    the tower guardian, Dumont?
                    Put him with the others?


                               SARK
                    No, bit brain.

         Sark turns to face him.


                               SARK


                    Prepare him for inquisition. I need
                    a little relaxation. But first rez up
                    the carrier for pursuit... And one other
                    thing.


         lie stares at the lieutenant, paranoid


                               SARK
                           (continuing)
                    Don'tthink anymore. I do the
                   thinkingaround here.

         We see Flynn looking back the way they came. Yori is at the controls,
         with Tron beside her, his arm around her shoulders, looking at Flynn.

                               FLYNN
                    What about our friend - Sark?


                               TRON
                    Probably decided not to pursue us,
                    The Sea of Simulation is tricky..
                    lot of illusions...rough navigating.
                    Programs have a way of just...
                    disappearing here.

                               FLYNN
                    Not us, I hope.


                               TRON
                         (shakes his head,
                          indicates disk)
                    Not with this disk. I'm going to
                    check on the beam connection, Yori.
                    You two can keep a watch out for
                    grid bugs.


         He moves off down the walkway, the Bit following. Flynn turns and
         leans out over the side.


                               FLYNN
                    Boy the view from up here... you
                    know the territory?


                               YORI
                    A little ...
                       (points out sights)
                    Over there, the Mountains of Data...
                    and I think that's the Silicon Valley...

         We see an area of darkened, gloomy, two-dimensional shapes.

                              (sadly)
                    The MCP blasted it... There are very
                    few domains left with any power at all.


                               FLYNN
                    Lousy utility companies ...
                    they're the same wherever you go.

         Where we see Dumont plugged into energy foot sockets. Two memory
         guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest.
         Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his
         expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of
         torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA
         PULLS BACK AND ANGLES UP to the second level where we see Sark
         looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell.

                    Old enough to remember the MCP when he
                    was just a chess program. He started
                    small, and he'll end small.

                    That's very funny, Dumont. Maybe I
                    should keep you around, just to make me
                    laugh.

         controls, with the Bit hovering over them. Yori is, pointing
         something out to Flynn.

         reacting to the sight of something ahead of the Solar Sailer.


    470  LONG SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                      470


         We see the transmission beam which carries the Solar Sailer
         increasing in brightness, throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing
         energy, coming towards the ship. It hits the sail, and the ship
         shivers. The whole beam is now tripled in brightness.

         As Tron runs up to Yori's side. He grabs her shoulder, pulling her
         against him... they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the
         increasing beam.


                               TRON
                            (shouting)
                    What is it?


                               YORI
                    Power surge... the transmission beam's
                    too strong!


                               TRON
                    We have to get off this beam!


                               YORI
                             (frantic)
                    I can't. There's no junction due for at
                    least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!

         The ship is throbbing and jerking, bits of it de-rezzing.

         Flynn looks around, points to one side.


                               FLYNN
                    There's another beam!


                               YORI
                    It's too far!


         Flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship, makes a decision, and
         races forward.

         We see Flynn race to the bow, where the horrendous power of the beam
         is blasting away at the sails. He slows down, but keeps going.

                    The beam connection...
                    but he'll be de-rezzed!!

         We see Flynn emerge, leaning out into the beam, his face brilliantly
         illuminated by the beam. He reaches forward with one arm.

         He is lying spread eagled at the bow, with one arm in the light. He
         raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but
         too far to reach. Suddenly his whole body glows with the same
         intensity as the beam.

         from his arm.

         We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring
         transmission beam and connect. We see the ship pulsing, and then
         breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting
         to the safe beam.

         The craft starts to travel safely on its way.

         Tron races down the walkway toward Flynn, closely followed by Yori
         and the Bit.

         as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn. We can
         see Yori's anxious face to one side. Flynn's head comes up for a
         moment, dazed.

                               FLYNN
                              (weakly)
                    Did we make it?

                    Yes.


         Flynn smiles weakly.


                               FLYNN
                    Hooray for our side...


         He faints.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

         Yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with Flynn
         stretched out beside her, his head in her lap. Her hands are on
         either side of his face. Tron is seated across from them and the Bit
         is quietly floating beside him. In b.g. we SEE that the Solar Sailer
         is passing through a series of narrow canyons.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... you guys OK?

                    go check the instruments ...

         Flynn looks down at his hands and turns away, leaning against the

         His voice trails off. Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the
         cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the
         cell door.

                    You! No!


         Flynn looks up curiously.

                    Well... we can take care of that
                    soon enough.


         He points to Dumont. The guards grab him.

                    Take this program to the holding pit.

                    on this ship, though -- I'll take
                    the Transport Beam.
                             (smiles)
                    Less traffic. But when I disembark,
                    this ship...and everything that remains
                    on board...will automatically de-rez.
                    This means you.

                    Enjoy your trip...


         LAUGHING, Sark leaves. The guards, with Dumont in custody, follow.


    533  SHOT LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PIT CELLS                         533


         into the cell that holds a dozen dejected, defeated, aging programs,
         the I/0 Tower guardians. We see the door to the cell open and guards
         beginning to herd them out.


    534  ANGLE - LEVEL ABOVE CELLS                                    534


         where we can see Sark walking towards an open portal. He looks down
         into the cells at his feet and laughs again.

         staring up as Sark moves past their cell and out of view.

         of the carrier approaching a flat-topped mountain, with the
         communication beam of the MCP visible at the very center.

         of the MCP's mesa moving closer, the only structure visible in a
         vast plain covered with a glowing grid.


    540  EXT. BRIDGE AREA OF CARRIER                                  540


         We can see the observation port and below that a section of the
         ship's structure is moving forward.

         As the landing pod disengages completely, floating away from the
         carrier and then starting its final journey to the MCP, picking up
         speed on a straight and even course. We can see a small speck
         clinging to one side of the pod...


    543A CLOSE UP - SPECK                                             543A


         TRON, holding himself braced into a narrow crack.


    544  FLYNN, YORI AND THE BIT                                      544


         Yori is sitting with her head in her hands. Flynn is at the door
         testing it, running his finger along the edges.


    545  LONG SHOT                                                    545


         Of landing pod flying over the glowing grid that surrounds the MCP's
         mesa.


    546  A SHOT                                                       546


         from behind the carrier of the pod getting smaller with distance.


    547  POD POV                                                      547


         Steep cliff face of the MCP's mesa is coming closer and closer, more
         and more detail visible.


    548  POD                                                          548


         tiny against the massive bulk of the MCP's mesa, descending for
         landing. The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular
         shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes,
         fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the
         structure.


    549  INT. POD                                                     549


         There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From
         the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly.
         Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we
         gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at
         the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming
         black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam
         rises out of the center of this cylinder.


    550  EXT. CARRIER                                                 550

         Flynn still at the door. Suddenly his hand goes right through the
         door.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


         The door is disappearing, dissolving.


                               FLYNN
                       (continuing; turning)
                    Look, the door's almost...


         He stops in horror.


                                                   CUT TO:


    552  HIS POV                                                      552


         Yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them.
         She is de-rezzing too. Her whole body becoming transparent. She looks
         up dimly at Flynn, with no expression.


    553  WIDE SHOT                                                    553


         Flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging
         her close, his energy flowing into her.


         Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is
         too late to save her. Her eyes are half-closed.


                               FLYNN
                    Yori!


    554  CLOSE SHOT                                                   554


         Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch.
         Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color
         floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
         Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.


                               YORI
                             (in awe)
                    You... you brought me back...?
                    Why...? How ... ?


         Flynn lets go of her.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!


         He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs
         to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers.
         Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration.
         Suddenly the Bit pops into life.


                               BIT
                    Yes!


                               FLYNN
                    Let's get outta here.


         They head for the door.


    555  THE MESA TOP OF THE MCP                                      555

         The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading
         them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger.
         The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the
         path.

    556  EXT. POD DOOR - LIEUTENANT                                   556


         on duty. He hears a NOISE and turns... and in a flash of light a
         speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES
         over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its
         arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.

    557  CLOSER SHOT                                                  557

         It is Tron. He steps over the body of the Lieutenant.

    558  THE MCP                                                      558

         from right outside. We see the prisoners beginning to file inside,
         up the final slope leading to the base of the MCP.

    559  SIDE SHOT OF THE ENTRANCE                                    559

         to the MCP. As the guardian programs enter. Sark stands waiting,
         watching them, his back to the camera.

    560  POV OF THE DOOMED PROGRAMS                                   560


         As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
         beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
         finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
         network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
         surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
         the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
         impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
         but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
         inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
         continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
         STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
         the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.


                               MCP
                      (echoing, booming)
                    I am delighted that so many of you
                    could turn out to give your
                    power over to me...


    561  FULL SHOT - THE PROGRAMS                                     561


         lining the wall. They are sucked back, pinned, immobile, and we see
         them starting to de-rez.


                               MCP
                    You're very lucky, all of you. You
                    are participating in the creation of
                    the single most powerful program in
                    the history of the system... of all
                    systems...


         The programs begin to disappear, one by one.


                               MCP
                          (continuing)
                    A program with a will... with
                    ambition... a superior form of
                    life...

                    Go!


         Dumont's face is devoid of hope. He starts into the MCP's inner
         chamber.

    565  EXT. CARRIER BRIDGE                                          565


         Flynn and Yori race into view. We can see two of the memory guards
         in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in
         the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out
         the window.


                               FLYNN
                    Check out the controls.


         As Yori looks over the control conso1e.

         Down the length of the carrier. It is de-rezzing, parts of it gone
         already. We see the CPU approaching, as the carrier rises.

         sections only visible as outlines.

                    Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
                    finally come to terms with one

         Sark is standing, looking in the opening, waiting for the signal to
         depart. His back is to the camera.

                               VOICE
                    SARK!


         Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..

         We SEE Tron standing, legs spread, arms poised by his sides, disk in
         one hand. It gives off a pure white light.


    571  CLOSE UP SARK'S FACE                                         571

                    It doesn't matter. Prepare to
                    terminate.

         Sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist.

    573  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              573


         as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks
         under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks
         again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the
         two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and
         races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.

         His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great
         pulses of glowing energy into the carrier.

                    You are very persistent, Tron.


    579  MED. SHOT                                                    579


         Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice. Sark deflects it and
         immediately throws his own disk.


    580  SHOT OF TWO WEAPONS                                          580


         racing almost side by side through the air.

         as the two disks come at him.


                               TRON
                    I'm also better than you....


         He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as
         Sark's disk passes under him.


    582  SHOT OF SARK'S DISK                                          582


         Making a sharp turn in the air.


    583  SHOT OF TRON FROM BEHIND                                     583


         He looks over his shoulder, sees the disk coming at him.


    584  TRON'S HAND                                                  584


         As he slams his own disk into Sark's, using his as a shield.


    584A MED. SHOT SARK                                               584A

                               SARK
                    Very clever, Tron. You know you
                    should have joined me.


    585  OVERHEAD POV                                                 585


         Tron hurls again.


    586  FLYNN AND YORI                                               586


         Flynn is at the controls, transferring power.


                               FLYNN
                    Any response?
                               YORI
                    It's starting


         She looks down at the battle. Her hand reaches over and grips
         Flynn's tightly.


                                                   CUT TO:


    587  SARK                                                         587


         He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind,
         and holds up his own disk as a shield.


                               SARK
                    We would have made a great team.


    588  TRON'S DISK                                                  588


         turning sideways in its flight, edge on.


    589  SARK                                                         589


         With a CRASH and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through
         Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head. The disk shatters, and we
         see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the
         disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. We can see
         energy pouring out of this wound like blood.


    590  LONGER SHOT                                                  590

         Sark falls, dead, face first.

         wailing past Sark's body.


    593  SHOT FROM BEHIND TRON                                        593


         as he goes in the MCP's inner chamber.


                               MCP
                      (before he sees Tron)
                    It is very good that you...

         framed in the doorway.


                               TRON
                    I don't think it is good for you, MCP.

    598  SHOT FROM BEHIND TRON                                        598


                               TRON
                    Sark's out. Would you like to
                    leave a message?


                               MCP
                    I am the message. The only message.
                    Sark!


         Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and
         returns to him.


                               MCP
                          (continuing)
                    SARK!


         As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over
         to him.


    599  CLOSE SHOT - WALL                                            599


         Dumont is transparent. Tron runs up to him.


                               TRON
                          (trying to pull
                       Dumont away from wall)
                    Dumont!


                               DUMONT
                    No... Tron ... must... destroy
                    MCP... first...

                               TRON

                    Flynn?

    600  MED. SHOT - TRON                                             600


         He turns, murder in his eyes, draws back his arm for the throw.


                               MCP
                    Program... stop. This is not allowed!


         Tron throws.

         The disk smashes into him. Once, twice...


                               MCP
                    I will not allow this Sark!
                           (thundering)
                    SARK!!!


         The voice reverberates, shaking the chamber. Tron continues to throw.

    602  OMITTED                                                      602

         Sark's dead hand. We see the circuit pattern of the mesa top begin
         to glow around the hand, throbbing with energy. The hand moves.


    604  TRON                                                         604


         throwing again at the MCP, hitting, catching his disk again.


                               MCP
                           (thundering)

         His body is glowing, expanding. He starts to rise, his face looks up.

    606  CLOSE UP - FACE                                              606


         It is vacant, staring with white eyes. His head still has the gaping
         hole in the forehead. He's a zombie, the living dead. He rises.


    607  LONG SHOT                                                    607

         Carrier floating over the CPU, near the MCP's beam. Flynn looks out,
         from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. He spots the
         beam.

                    Yori, steer us over the beam,
                    right next to it.


                               YORI
                       (going to controls)
                    Why? What are you going to do?

                    But... won't you be de-rezzed?

         Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
         goes up to him.


                               YORI
                    Flynn... you can't... I


                               FLYNN

                             her lips)
                    Shhhhh.


         He takes her in his arms.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                               (whispering)
                    I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if...
                    just once...


         His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
         change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
         love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.

         Finally Flynn pulls away from her. Her eyes stay shut for a second,
         then open.


                               FLYNN
                    Don't worry.

         He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
         on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
         shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.


    616  HER POV                                                      616


         Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
         directly into the center of MCP itself.


    617  INT. MCP                                                     617


         Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
         his voice is that of the MCP.


                               SARK/MCP
                    End of line, program...


         We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
         static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
         Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
         Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
         and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
         and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
         cones. And connects.


    618  SHOT OF THE APEX                                             618

         Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
         into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.


    620  SHOT OF THE MCP                                              620


         We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
         is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
         padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
         wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
         see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
         too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
         the MCP glows brighter and brighter.


    621  YORI AND THE BIT                                             621

         A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the
         camera.

    623  YORI                                                         623

         The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow
         returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates,
         leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.

    625  YORI                                                         625


         still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains
         regaining their life.

         one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows
         brightly, increasing.

         The carrier starts to descend.

    628  EXT. CPU MESA - TRON                                         628

         Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
         programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending.

    629  SHOT OF CARRIER                                              629

         Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very
         faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.

    630  EXT. CPU MESA                                                630

         Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
         her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his
         in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.

                               TRON
                            (laughing)
                    Nice...

                               YORI
                    It's something Users do.

                               TRON
                    Where's Flynn?

         He looks up at the bridge.

                               YORI
                    He's gone. He went into the beam.
                    He saved you. He saved all of us.

         Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at
         the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.

                               DUMONT
                    He really was a User...

                               BIT
                         (quietly, sadly)
                    Yes...

    631  LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD                                      631

         of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a
         shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    632  RACING OVER THE CIRCUIT PATTERN                              632


         and returning to the real world.


    633  THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB                                   633


         CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
         blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.


         WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
         chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.


         Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
         shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
         back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
         himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.


         He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
         flesh and blood.


         He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
         weak sunlight coming in.


         And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
         Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
         coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.


         Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
         document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
         face.


         The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
         tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    634  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA                           634


         Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's
         CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey -- you guys


         Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up
         a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.


                               ALAN
                    Flynn! I made it. I worked out some
                    new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk,
                    and -- it's running.


                               FLYNN
                    I know, I met him.


         Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
         from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    I mean, I saw it read-up -
                    hey, look at this.


         He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
         reading it to figure out its significance.


                               ALAN
                    Your old files -- ?


                               FLYNN
                    And Dillinger's instructions to
                    divert them -- it's all there -
                    look, even his home phone number,
                    when he logged on.


                               ALAN
                    Oh, that is beautiful. You've got
                    the goods...


         Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora
         get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.


                               FLYNN
                    You're telling me...


         As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
         on it.


    635  CRT SCREEN                                                   635


         The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and
         are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
         typical video game:


         A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
         electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
         first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
         directions.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    you have any idea how much I can sue these
                    jokers for?


                               LORA (V.0.)
                    Well, just don't forget your old friends
                    when you're rich and famous.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
                    this joint by then...


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                   Your friend Dillinger sure won't...


         The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
         EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
         SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
         formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
         HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.


                               FLYNN (V.O.)
                    Hey, you know anybody who wants to
                    get hold of some video games... cheap?


                               LORA (V.O.)
                    You're getting out of the business?


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                    Shouldn't you wait till your
                    lawsuit's settled?


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
                    video games to last me a good long
                    time. I feel like gettin' into some
                    real life...


         at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
         yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
         HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and


                                                        BLACK OUT.

    1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1

         On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being
         printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the
         center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
         simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually
         the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice
         speaking.

                               VOICE
                    As astonishing advances in computer
                    science are made, artificial intelligence
                    programs are being designed to assist
                    us in every area of life...

         We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,
         wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and
         intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by
         the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.

                               VOICE (CONT.)
                    In a world-wide network of electronics,
                    they travel through miles of circuitry
                    at the speed of light. We created them to
                    calculate and research, to help us design
                    and heal and think. With all that they can
                    do, are they only electrical impulses...
                    or are they a new form of life?

         The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face
         us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the
         programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves
         towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.
         As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place
         on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,
         a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
         the screen in huge letters.

                                    T R O N ! !

         The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
         become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as
         if it had an inner core of electricity.

         The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
         OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the
         ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.


         The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the
         electronic information in our computers, television sets and
         telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,
         data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first
         time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through
         the window of television screens.


                                                   CUT TO:


    2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2

         TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
         dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER
         SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely
         encasing them.


                                                   CUT TO:


    3    LONG SHOT                                                    3


         as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser
         trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the
         other.


                                                   CUT TO:


    4    REAL WORLD                                                   4


         Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,
         as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.


    5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5


         We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,
         their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR
         electronic beeping and popping.


    6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6


         Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
         landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to
         reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound
         like a crack of lightning.


    7    REAL WORLD                                                   7


         A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of
         Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D
         maze.


    8/9  OMITTED                                                      8/9


    10   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             10

         Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing
         glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the
         one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second
         warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.


    11   REAL WORLD                                                   11


         A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character'
         throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick
         glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring
         down, LAUGHING.

    12   OMITTED                                                      12

    13   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             13


         Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of
         Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space
         on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy
         at each other.

    14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14


         He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head
         mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching
         the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing
         yellow.


    15   CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT                              15

         fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.

    16   SARK                                                         16

         sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
         back with violent force.

    16A  THE SMALLER WARRIOR                                          16A


         desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes
         into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One
         last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate
         face as he falls to instant death.

    17   SARK                                                         17


         triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous
         glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words:

                        "WINNER:  BLUE - SARK!!"


                               BOY'S VOICE
                           (distant, echoing)
                    Aagh! God, Lisa, I almost had you that
                    time.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    18   REAL WORLD - THE VIDEO ARCADE                                18


         We see two TEENAGERS playing a table model video game, where we
         can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed. The game console is
         prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "ICOM."


                               BOY


                    Lemme play you again?


                               TEENAGE GIRL
                            (holds out a hand)


                    Yeah, if you've got another quarter.


         FOCUS ON SCREEN, ZOOM IN SLIGHTLY AND


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     19  ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             19


         Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
         looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the
         walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as
         Sark comes in and one of them calls out:


                               WARRIOR 1


                    Sark, my man! You are hot!


                               WARRIOR 2
                    That knuckleball gets 'em every
                    time, boy...


         Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY, and Sark moves on.


                                                   CUT TO:


    20   THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           20


         overlooking the video game grid. We see Sark walking onto the bridge,
         removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is
         sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
         satisfaction.

         The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
         cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then
         solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is
         hidden from view.


    21   INT. CYLINDER - SARK'S POV                                   21


         of this happening. We can see the inside surface of the cylinder
         ... a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features,
         appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.


                               VOICE (MCP)
                    You're getting brutal, Sark.
                    Brutal and needlessly sadistic.


         The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
         a drug addict, eyes glazed.


                               SARK
                    Thank. you, Master Control.


                               MCP
                    We might be capturing some military
                    programs soon... that interest you?


                               SARK
                    Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these
                    guys ... be a nice break from these
                    accounting creampuffs you keep sending
                    me. Which branch of the service?


                               MCP
                    Strategic Air Command.


                               SARK (impressed)
                    Nice.

         The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we
         CUT FROM a CLOSE SHOT of Sark's satiated face to:


    22   A CORRIDOR BENEATH THE GAME GRID                             22


         long, darkened, sinister. A dejected and disheveled character
         (CROM) is being escorted by a guard..


                               CAPTIVE (CROM)
                    Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just
                    a compound interest program, I work
                    at a savings and loan. I can't play
                    in these video games...

                               GUARD
                    Sure you can, pal. You're a natural
                    athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...


                               CROM
                    Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
                    check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
                    of breath. Hey, really...you're
                    gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
                    really mad. He's a full branch manager...


                               GUARD
                         (rolls his eyes)
                    Great, another religious nut.


         They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the
         protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.


    23   INT. CELL                                                    23


         as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's
         shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door,
         an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows,
         we can see the back of another captive program, and through the
         other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:


                               PROGRAM (RAM)
                    Welcome to luxury living.


         The new captive looks up, nervous.


                               CROM
                    Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
                    what I'm doing here.


                               RAM


                    You believe in the Users?


                               CROM
                    Sure, if I don't have a User, then
                    who wrote me?


                               RAM
                    That's what you're doing here. Master
                    Control Program's been snapping up
                    all us programs who believe...if he
                    thinks you're useful, he takes over
                    all your functions so he gets bigger...
                    an' if he can't use you, he sends you
                    down here to the Game Grid to get the
                    bits blasted outta you. What's your name?


                               CROM
                    Crom.


                               RAM


                    I'm Ram. They'll train you for
                    the games, but ... well, I hope you
                    make it okay. Hey, what's going on
                    in the other sectors? I've been stuck
                    in this Grid for 200 microcycles.


         He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.


                               CROM
                    It's murder out there. You can't even
                    travel around your own microcircuits
                    without permission from that Master
                    Control creep. Hauling me down here to
                    play games...who does he calculate he is?

                         (holds his head in his hands)
                    If only Tron was still around...


         He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange,
         still expression on his face.


                               CROM
                    You ever see that guy in action?
                    Hundred-percent independent. MCP
                    couldn't tell him what to --


         He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.


                               CROM
                           (continuing)
                    What's wrong? What did I say?


         There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.


                                                   CUT TO:


    24   THE FIGURE AT THE WINDOW                                     24


         It turns slowly, silhouetted by the light from the outer corridor.


    25   CLOSE UP - CROM                                              25


         reacting.  He GASPS and stares.

                               CROM
                    Oh my User...Tron--they've got
                    you in here?


    26   SHOT FROM OVER TRON'S SHOULDER                               26


         with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring.


                               TRON
                    Not for long, friend.

    27   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. PATHWAYS - SOMEWHERE FAR             27
         OFF IN THE SYSTEM


         Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along
         one of the paths.

    28   INT. TANK                                                    28


         A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten
         and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing
         coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck
         driver on an all-night run.


                               CLU
                    Think we can merge into this mem'ry
                    okay, good buddy?


         A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands
         into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as
         it speaks.


                               BIT
                            (eagerly)
                    10-4!


         As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light.


                               CLU
                    Now, ol' Flynn said to look over
                    in here ...


    28A  EXT. TANK                                                    28A


         The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded
         corners -- a computer memory microcircuit.

    28B  INT. TANK                                                    28B


                               CLU
                    ...but I don't see what he's looking
                    for. I'd better get over to that
                    input/output tower and let him know.


    28C  ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER                                      28C


         at the instrument panel.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    29   REAL WORLD - INT. A DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT                    29


         A shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal
         keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits
         for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of
         large video parlor game consoles.


                               FLYNN
                    Come on, you scuzzy little data,
                    be in there...


    30   A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM                                  30


         He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive,
         charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye.


                               FLYNN
                    I've got such nice blue paper to
                    print you out on, if you'll just sit
                    still...


         WE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of
         the CRT screen reflected there.


                                                   CUT TO:


    31   ELECTRONIC WORLD--EXT TANK                                   31


         The tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall, glowing
         "tower" -- an input/output component.


    32   INTERIOR TANK                                                32


         A red light flashes on the control panel. Clu comes alert and sits
         up. He stares at the warning. Spot of light that is Bit zips up next
         to his head.


                               CLU
                    Uh oh...we got company.


                               BIT
                     (coming into shape again,
                        but red this time)
                    No!


                               CLU
                    You said it ... one of those
                    Recognizers comes after me,
                    gonna hafta jump clear out of
                    the data stream.


                                                   CUT TO:


    33   REAL WORLD - INT. FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                  33


         We see Flynn sit up abruptly, and his fingers start flying over the
         keys.


    34   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. OF TANK                              34


         We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the
         distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form,
         U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes--
         a recognizer. It hovers above the ground.


    35   LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE                         35


         A second Reco is coming up behind the first.


    36   INT. OF TANK                                                 36

                           (in dismay)
                    Oh my...the long arm o' the law.


                                                   CUT TO:


    37   EXT. LONG SHOT THE TANK                                      37


         FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the
         ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at
         the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley.
         The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction.


    38   CLOSE SHOT - TURRET                                          38


         Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away
         from the tank, fast.

    39   LONG SHOT                                                    39


         A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the
         Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can
         see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape.


    40   CLU                                                          40


         running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco
         up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it.


    41   CLOSE UP - CLU'S FACE                                        41


         reacting in fear, looking up as the screen GOES TO BLACK.


                                                   CUT TO:


         REAL WORLD


    42   INTERIOR, FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                          42


         SHOT OF THE SCREEN. A complex set of programming figures ends
         abruptly in a single blue line which prints out across the screen
         over and over, gradually filling it completely.


    43   SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                           43


         Flynn.


                               FLYNN


                    Ah, hell...busted again.


         He tries clearing the monitor, but the repeating line just comes
         right back, monotonously moving across the screen.


    44   SHOT OF THE SCREEN - HOLD as we:                             44

    45   ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER                            45


         Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like
         Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly,
         torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP.
         Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards.


                               GUARD
                    Got a pirate program here... says
                    his name's Clu.


         The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling
         a suspect.


                               MCP
                    What'd he pull?


                               GUARD
                    Came into the system with a stolen

         The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
         momentarily becomes unbearable.


                               MCP
                    Who programmed you?


         The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.


                               MCP (CONT.)
                    You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
                    But if you tell us who put you up
                    to it, you could make it easy on
                    yourself. Come on, who's your user?


                               CLU
                    Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty

                    makin' me talk.


                               MCP
                    Suit yourself ...


         The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but
         doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken
         pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into
         electric static.


                               MCP
                    Get me Dillinger.

    46   THE REAL WORLD - EXT. CITY GRID - NIGHT - POV FROM           46
         HELICOPTER

         We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
         vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
         impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
         scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
         party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
         up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:

                               DILLINGER (O.S.)
                    Hello?
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mr. Dillinger?
                               DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yes.
                               A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello, please hold a moment for the
                    Master Control Program


         As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
         focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
         an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
         approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
         accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
         increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
         sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
         landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
         CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
         a passenger.


    47   EXT. SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING                               47


                               PILOT'S VOICE
                    will you be around for a while, or
                    are you going right back out?


                               DILLINGER'S VOICE
                    Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
                    got some things to take care of.


         THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
         off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
         In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written
         across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology.

         We see Dillinger's face looking out of the window as the helicopter
         approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.


    51   EXT. THE HELIPORT - NIGHT                                    51


         on top of the building. Several technicians are at hand, and as the
         helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it.

    58   INT. DILLINGER'S OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT              58


         A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
         suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
         entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
         fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
         printed out on the screen:


         REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
         Password: MASTER.


         The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
         addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
         through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
         its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
         that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
         compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.


                               MCP
                    Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.


         Dillinger settles into a chair.


                               DILLINGER
                    No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
                    one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
                    What's up?


                               MCP
                    It's our friend the boy detective.
                    He's nosing around again.


                               DILLINGER
                    Flynn?


                               MCP
                    Yes.  It felt like Flynn.


                               DILLINGER
                    He's still looking for that old file...
                    can't you just appropriate it?


                               MCP
                    I would if I could find it. it's stashed
                    somewhere off in the system ...
                    out of my range. Meanwhile...


                               DILLINGER
                    Meanwhile, he might find it.


                               MCP
                    I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
                    and kicked him out, but he's getting
                    trickier all the time.


                               DILLINGER
                    I think we'd better shut off all
                    access till we can find that file.
                    Just to be safe.


                               MCP
                    There's a 68.71 percent chance
                    you're right.


                               DILLINGER
                    Cute.

         Dillinger watches as the computer screen wipes blank.

         he looks like he hasn't slept for a week. On top of the terminal is
         a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient
         popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is

                               DILLINGER
                    Come on in...


                               ALAN
                    Alan. Alan Bailey.


                               DILLINGER
                    Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
                    seeding...great piece of work.
                    How's it going?


         He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.


                               ALAN
                    Well, I don't know...I just tried
                    to run this program I've been working
                    on, and I was denied access all of
                    a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
                    laid off and nobody told me.


                               DILLINGER
                    oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

                               ALAN
                    Yeah...?


                               DILLINGER
                    We have to close that down, just
                    briefly. Security reasons.  Someone
                    with that access has been tampering.


                               ALAN
                    I hope you don't think it's me.
                    I don't even balance my checkbook on
                    downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at
                    home for that.

                               DILLINGER
                    No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
                    It should only be a couple of days.
                    What's the thing you're working on?

                                ALAN
                    It's called Tron. It's a security
                    program itself, actually. Monitors
                    all the contacts between our system
                    and other systems... If it finds
                    anything going on that's not scheduled,
                    it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
                    on it.


                               DILLINGER
                    Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?


                               ALAN
                    No, it'll run independently.
                    It can watchdog the MCP as well.


                               DILLINGER
                    Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
                    you running again in a couple of days,
                    I hope.


                               ALAN
                    Ok

         Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:

                               DILLINGER
                               (trouble)
                    Oh boy.


         The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and
         through the speakers.

                               MCP
                    Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry -

                            (sharply)
                    I can't afford to have an independent
                    program monitoring me. Do you have any
                    idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
                    How many programs I've appropriated?


                               DILLINGER
                                (nods)
                    It's my fault. I programmed you to want
                    so much...


                               MCP
                    And I was planning to hit the Pentagon

                    The Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    It shouldn't be any harder than General
                    Motors was. But now...this is what I get
                    for using humans.


                               DILLINGER
                    Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.


                               MCP
                    I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.


                               DILLINGER
                    What do you want with the Pentagon?


                               MCP
                    The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
                    I'm bored with corporations. With the
                    information I can access, I can run things
                    900 to 1200 times better than any human.


                               DILLINGER
                    If you think -


                               MCP
                    You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
                    and read it up on a VDT at the New
                    York Times, would you?


                               DILLINGER
                    You wouldn't dare.


                               MCP
                    So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
                    out of the system. And get me those Chinese
                    language program I asked for.

         encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
         picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
         tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
         tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
         getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
         at them.


         We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
         with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
         using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
         hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
         wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
         has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
         bristling white eyebrows.


         In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
         defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
         Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
         at the moment.

         As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:


                               LORA
                              (sighs)
                    Well, here goes nothing ...


                               GIBBS
                    Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
                    hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."


                               LORA
                    Well, I meant -


                               GIBBS
                    Whereas actually, what we propose to
                    do is to turn something into nothing
                    and back again. So you might just as
                    well have said, "Here goes something
                    and here comes nothing." Hah?


         They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
         cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
         polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
         laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
         plat-form -- empty.


                               LORA
                    Let me make sure we're running


         She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
         connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.


         Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
         console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
         the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
         close enough to watch.


    74   ANGLE - LORA                                                 74


         She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.


                               LORA
                    Looks good...


                               GIBBS (O.S.)


                    Let 'er rip...


    75   LASER LAB - AS BEFORE                                        75


         The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
         sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
         received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
         it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
         the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
         discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
         film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
         five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
         rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.


                               GIBBS
                             (quietly)
                    Perfect.


         At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
         and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
         shoe-covers, walking toward them.


                               ALAN
                    Beautiful!


                               GIBBS
                    Hello, Alan.


                               ALAN
                    Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
                    all day, and you guys are down here
                    disintegrating things and having fun.


         He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.


                               GIBBS
                    Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
                    While the laser is dismantling the
                    molecular structure of the object,
                    the computer maps out a holographic
                    model of it. The molecules themselves
                    are suspended in the laser beam. Then
                    the computer reads the model back out,
                    the molecules go back into place, and...
                          (indicates ball)
                    voila.


    75   CONTINUED                                                    75


                               ALAN
                    Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?


                               GIBBS
                    Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
                    and you must purchase your program
                    at least 30 days in advance. Hah!


         The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with
         their arms around each other's shoulders.


                               LORA
                    How's it going upstairs?


                               ALAN
                    Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
                    to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
                    with Group 7 access out of the system.


         Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.


                               ALAN
                           (continuing)
                     Ever since he got that Master Control
                     Program set up, system's got more bugs
                     than a bait store.


                               GIBBS
                    Well, you have to expect some static.
                    Computers are just machines after all,
                    they can't think...


                               ALAN
                    They'll start to soon enough.


                               GIBBS
                              (wryly)
                    Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
                    will start thinking, and people will
                    stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
                    data through. See you tomorrow.


         AD LIB goodnights.


    78   INT. CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT                                   78


         outside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the
         protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off
         her white suit, and Alan pulls white paper protectors off his shoes.

                               LORA
                    Did you say Group 7 access?

                               LORA
                    Did he say why?

                    Something about tampering. Some body's
                    prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget
                    into his checking account, I don't know.
                    Why are you so interested?


                               LORA
                    Flynn had Group 7 access.


                               ALAN
                    Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not
                    interested in talking about him.


                               LORA
                    Oh, I wish you'd forget about that.
                    It was all so long ago. I've totally
                    gotten over it.


                               ALAN
                    Okay, okay...


                               LORA
                    I want to go to his place.

                               ALAN
                    You call that getting over it?

                               LORA
                    I mean I want both of us to go.

         walking through the aisle of games, from behind. They are slightly
         bewildered and confused by the weird noises. Lora approaches a
         junior high school girl who's watching a hot game of "Battle Zone."

         and points. Alan and Lora look.

         playing a game called Space Paranoids, CAMERA TILTING UP into his
         face, catching the orange glow from the console.


         The game has a prominent ICOM logo under the screen. Flynn is a
         cocky kid in his mid-20s, unshaven, wearing a T-shirt, jeans,
         jogging shoes. He's racked up a terrific score.

         Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans.
         As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to
         999,999,999 -- then flashes the word "RECORD" as lights blink and
         a SIREN sounds. The kids cheer wildly.


                               FLYNN
                    It's all in the wrist, friends.


         He grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find Lora

         favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade
         noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans
         against a game, nervous; Lora paces.

                    Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a
                    little hacking here. Which I've got
                    every reason, as you well know...

                               (points to himself)
                    is one of the brightest young
                    software engineers at ICOM. He's so
                    bright that he starts going in there
                    at night, and sets up a private memory
                    file, and begins writing a program
                    for a video game he is inventing,
                    called...
                             (waves at one of the

                    Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown...
                    whole slew of 'em. I was this close
                            (gestures)
                    to starting my own little enterprise.
                    But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another
                    software engineer -- not so young,
                    not so bright, but very, very sneaky.
                    One night, our boy Flynn goes to his
                    terminal, tries to read up his file,
                    and ... nothing. A big blank. We now
                    take you to three months later.
                    Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
                    video games he has "invented" -- the
                    slime didn't even change the names --
                    and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus
                    begins his meteoric rise to...what is
                    he now, Executive V.P.?

                    million quarters a week in Space Paranoids
                    machines and I'm not seeing one dime.


                               ALAN
                    I still don't get why you're trying to
                    break into the system.


                               FLYNN
                    Because somewhere... in one of those
                    memories ... is the evidence. If I got in
                    far enough, I could reconstruct it.

                    know what you're up to.

                    Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.
                    Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.
                    Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,

                    file before he does..


                               FLYNN
                    Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just
                    slip it into another system as soon as it
                    locates it...


                               ALAN
                    Not if my Tron program was running. That
                    would seal the system off. If your file's in
                    there...


                               FLYNN
                    Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge
                    us a Group 6 access...


         They all look at each other. After a beat, Lora holds the keys
         to her van aloft.

    101  DILLINGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   101


    Dillinger is seated at his computer-console desk. Gibbs, standing,
    faces him.


                               GIBBS
                    Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own
                    people can't get access to their
                    programs ... you know how frustrating
                    it is, when you're working on a piece
                    of research -


                               DILLINGER
                    Walter, I sympathize, but I have data
                    coming out of the Master Control Program
                    saying there is something screwy --

                               GIBBS
                    That MCP, you know, that's half the
                    problem right --


                               DILLINGER
                    The MCP is the most efficient way of
                    handling what we do. I can't sit and
                    worry about every little user request that --


                               GIBBS
                    User requests are what computers are for.


                               DILLINGER
                    Doing our business is what computers are
                    for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM
                    isn't the business you started in your garage
                    anymore --


         As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board,
         and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast
         computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning
         in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
         millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
         computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
         Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth
         adding up, accounts receivable and assets.


                               DILLINGER (CONT.)
                    We're billing accounts in 30 countries,
                    we've got one of the largest systems in
                    existence...


         Gibbs turns wearily away from the display.


                               GIBBS
                    Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I
                    was back in that garage...


                               DILLINGER
                    It can be arranged...


         Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again.


                               GIBBS
                    That was uncalled-for.


                               DILLINGER
                    I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately...
                    you feel like going for a drink?


                               GIBBS
                    Thank you, no. I have some work to do...
                    assuming I can still log on.


         He exits.


    102  EXT. ICOM BUILDING - NIGHT                                   102


         Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from ICOM's
         main gate. The ICOM building looms high above them, an ominous box.

         A digital CLOCK on the dashboard reads 12:12. Lora is at the wheel,
         Alan next to her.


                               LORA
                    You better get in back with Flynn.
                    And keep down.


         She jerks her thumb over her shoulder.


                               ALAN
                    Do I gotta?


         But he climbs over the seat, and Lora starts to drive slowly forward.

                    glow of good health.


                               FLYNN
                    Want one?

                    Uh... got any cinnamon?


         Flynn smiles, hands Alan a doughnut.

                    Keep it down, you guys.


    104  EXT. ICOM - THE GIGANTIC SECURITY ENTRANCE - NIGHT           104


         Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the ICOM
         building, and the three get out. Lora inserts her I.D. card into a
         magnetic reader beside the door. Nothing happens.


                               LORA
                    I don't think I'm cleared for this.

                    I'm certainly not.


                               FLYNN
                    Move aside. Let the kid have some room.

         He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black
         box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with LED numerals
         and a small calculator keyboard. He leans over the security lock,
         his BACK TO THE CAMERA and PLAYS a couple of notes. There's a
         distinct CLICK, an the door starts to swing open ... and open ...
         and open. We see that this door is about twenty feet thick. Flynn
         starts LAUGHING.


    105  INT. A CORRIDOR                                              105


         The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to
         nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall.
         But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them.


                               LORA
                    Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at

                    Swell...I'll log us both on, and you
                    can get your Tron thing running...

         of the laser lab. We see Flynn's face peek out and see the camera.
         His head pulls back in.


    113  SHOT OF HALLWAY                                              113


         As the security camera aims away from the-elevator, Flynn and Lora
         make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching.

         approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
         his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
         camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,

         settling in, loosening his fingers, like a concert pianist, or a
         safecracker. He types in a code number, presses the "enter" key.

         It clears abruptly, and the following appears as we hear the VOICE
         of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey hey, it's that big Master Control

                    You don't look a thing like your pictures...

                    I'm afraid you...


         The voice lurches, goes into high speed, and then back to normal.


                               MCP
                          (continuing;
                         slightly shaken)
                    Stop, Flynn. You realize I can't allow this.

         We see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising
         silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice.


         We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it
         is this section that is being activated.

         grinning, typing.


                               FLYNN
                    Now, how do you expect to run the
                    universe if you let a few unsolvable
                    problems throw you like that? C'mon,
                    big boy, let's see what...


                               MCP
                    You're entering a big error, Flynn...
                    I'm going to have to put you on the
                    Game Grid.


                               FLYNN
                    Games, huh? I'll give you --


         Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
         behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
         freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
         a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
         ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
         being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
         with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
         blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


    129  THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one      129
         we saw at the opening of the film'.


         The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
         rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
         getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
         glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
         covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
         closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
         with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
         angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
         deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
         an internal energy.


         We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
         structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
         and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
         everything blurring with the speed.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    130  ELECTRONIC WORLD - A TUNNEL                                  130


         made up of rings of energy, and we are diving straight down it.

         We see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the
         outside, and suddenly we're at the bottom, and the figure stops,
         staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.

    132  SHOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL                             132


         We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now
         covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry,
         glowing with energy. Flynn shakes his head dazedly.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only
                    thinks it's happening...


         He looks up and SEES something.


    133  FLYNN'S POV                                                  133


         A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff,
         is right in front of him. This character reaches out an arm and
         grabs Flynn.

         being dragged off the entry tube platform.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is
                    about those parking tickets, I can
                    explain everything...


    135  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           135


         hovering over the Game Grid. We see Sark in his feet sockets, his
         hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE
         fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering
         into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the
         cylinder of the MCP.


                               MCP
                    SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.


         Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the MCP.


                               SARK
                            (hoarsely)
                    Yes, MCP.


                               MCP
                    I've got a little challenge for you, Sark --
                    a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I
                    want him treated in the usual manner. Train
                    him for the games... let him hope for a
                    while... and blow him away.


                               SARK
                    You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send
                    me somebody with a little moxie ... what
                    kind of program is he?


                               MCP
                    He's not any kind of program, Sark.
                    He's a User.


         Sark looks up, shocked.


                               SARK
                    A User?


                               MCP
                    That's right. He pushed me...in the
                    other world. Somebody pushes me, I push
                    back. So I brought him down here ...
                    What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.



                               SARK
                    Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,
                    a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User
                    even wrote you...


                               MCP
                    Now get this straight, pal -- no one
                    User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million
                    of their man-years! I'm bigger than all
                    those little wimps put together!
                            (disgust)
                    Humans they can't even keen their social
                    order in one piece

                               SARK
                    But-what if I can't...?


                               MCP
                    You rather take your chances with me?
                    Want me to slow down your power cycles
                    for you?


         The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken.


                               SARK
                    Wait...I need that...


                               MCP
                    Then pull yourself together. Get this
                    clown trained. I want him in the Games
                    until he dies playing.

                    Acknowledge.


                               SARK
                             (weakly)
                    Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...


                               MCP
                    End of line.


         The hologram disappears and Sark's power returns.

         Two guards leading Flynn down it, ECHOING FOOTSTEPS.


         They turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a
         cell. The door opens automatically. Flynn holds back.


                               GUARD

         The guard shoves Flynn inside and SLAMS the door, cutting off his
         voice.

         The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence.
         Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands.

         understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening
         of the neighboring cell.


    140  INT. NEXT CELL - RAM'S                                       140


         Ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from Tron's.

         He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back,
         so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey! Who are you guys?
                    What's the story around here?


         But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
         it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
         come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
         disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.


    142  RAM                                                          142


         turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.


                               RAM
                    You want to watch those force fields...


         He goes to the window opening.


                               RAM (CONT.)
                    You'll be having plenty of chances to
                    get hurt, don't worry about that.


                               FLYNN
                    Look...just so I can tell my friends
                    what this dream was about, okay?
                    Where am I?

                    You're a..."guest" of the Master Control

                    Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play
                    video games better than anybody.


         Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything,
         there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell
         opens.

         we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as
         Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the
         opposite direction.

         A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with
         balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier
         hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new
         captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They
         pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of
         them. Flynn is in the front of the line.

                    procedures.


         Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is
         amplified over the grid.

                    Those of you who continue to profess
                    a belief in the Users will receive
                    the standard substandard training.
                    This will result in your eventual

    176  1. SHOT OF FLYNN, held immobile while a laser scans          176
            his mouth.


    177  2. A LINE OF RECRUITS files past a checkpoint. Each          177
            is handed a disk.

    178  3. THE RECRUITS file out into a training area.               178

    179  4. We see AN ARM being fitted with a cesta.                  179

    180  5. ONE of the more experienced CONSCRIPTS, RAM,              180
            demonstrates the throw with the cesta.


    181  6. FLYNN tries an awkward throw. In the b.g. other           181
            recruits are practicing.


    182  7. RAM instructs Flynn. Flynn is getting better. He          182
            spins and catches a pellet.


    183  8. A demonstration of the DISK GAME by two other warriors.   183

    185  FLYNN BACK IN HIS CELL                                       185


         for a rest period. He is pacing back and forth, and we can see Ram
         seated in the next cell. Flynn goes to the bars.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey, Ram ... what were you ...
                    you know, before?


                               RAM
                           (nostalgic,
                            brightens)
                    Oh, I was an actuarial program...
                    worked at a big insurance company.
                    It really gives you a great feeling,
                    helping folks plan for their future
                    needs -- and of course, if you look
                    at the payments as an annuity, over
                    the years, the cost is really


                               FLYNN
                             (about to
                             get bored)
                    Yeah, yeah -- that's great.


                               RAM
                    How 'bout yourself?


                               FLYNN
                    Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...


                               RAM
                              (nods)
                    Sure, a little disorientation. That's
                    normal, when they transport you. It'll
                    come back to you. You're doing real
                    well in training. Remarkable, really...


         The POUNDING on Flynn's cell begins again.


    187  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           187


         We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's
         console. Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous,
         frightened of this new User-warrior.


                               SARK
                         (over his shoulder)
                    Wait a minute...put this guy against
                    one of the other recruits.


    188  OMIT                                                         188

    189  A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM                       189


         We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
         bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
         circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
         marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
         When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
         We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
         and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
         looks over at Crom, who's anxious.


                               FLYNN
                    Looks like we're in the same boat here -


                               CROM
                              (jumpy)
                    You think you're gonna wipe me right
                    out, don't you?


                               FLYNN
                    No, I


         A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
         upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
         straight for Flynn.


         Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
         his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
         right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
         himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.


    190  FLYNN'S POV - DOWN                                           190

         down, down between the rings into an infinite pit.


    191  BACK TO FLYNN                                                191

         staring down. There's a SOUND and he looks up.

    192  HIS POV                                                      192


         Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


    193  FLYNN                                                        193


         reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther
         edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and
         catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back.


    194  CROM                                                         194


         Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains,
         but misses. One of his rings disappears.

    195  FLYNN reacting                                               195


                               FLYNN
                       (happy he's scored)
                    Okay!

         High above the game we see Sark watching.


    197  FLYNN                                                        197


         racing for another catch. He makes it and hurls the pellet again.
         We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast.


    198  OMIT                                                         198

                               FLYNN
                    Here's an easy one...


         Flynn throws again. The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads
         straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he
         was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of
         the next ring to keep from falling.


 200-201 OMIT                                                         200-201

         He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it
         ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring.


    203  SARK                                                         203


         His face lit from below by the glow of the Game Grid... angry

         He puts down his cesta. Suddenly a voice rings out from above.
         Flynn looks up. There, appearing in the mirror disk above, is Sark's
         face, furious, huge.


                               SARK
                    Finish the game!

         Flynn holds up the pellet... and drops it down into the abyss below.
         He stares back up at Sark's immense image.


                               FLYNN

         on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost
         presses it... We see him-straining, trying to overcome his
         conditioning. Then he snatches his hand away.

         He SLAMS his palm down on a panel on the console, and a BUZZER
         SOUNDS.


    213  FLYNN                                                        213


         as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting
         to run across to him.

    215  A CORRIDOR IN THE GAME AREA                                  215


         Flynn is being escorted down it. A couple of big Blue Warriors go by
         and deliberately brush into Flynn.

                               WARRIOR
                          (turning on Flynn,
                              snarling)
                    Outta  my way, rookie.


         Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back
         and pulls out his disk.


                               FLYNN
                    Out of my way, zero bit.


         He moves as if to throw the disk.


                               WARRIOR
                            (backing away)
                    Sure, sure ... just kiddin'.


         The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as
         Flynn and his guards continue on.

                    Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!


                               FLYNN
                         (under his breath)
                    Tron...?


         He leans over to get a better look at Tron and GASPS in surprise.

                               FLYNN
                    Alan!

                               TRON
                            (frowning)
                    Where did you hear that name?


                               FLYNN
                    Well, isn't it -- ?


                               TRON
                    The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?


                               FLYNN
                          (thinking fast)
                    I, uh... I'm a program from a User
                    that... knows Alan...?


                               RAM
                    He was disoriented in transport, Tron.


                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of
                    stuff. Like...my User wants me to go
                    after the MCP


         Before they can go on, the BUZZER sounds.


                                                   CUT TO:


    217  LONG SHOT OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                            217


         floating over the Game Grid, with a view of the light cycle arena.
         ZOOM IN on the section of the grid where the game is about to start.


    218  A SHOT FROM ABOVE                                            218


         The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite
         sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by
         high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier
         hovering high overhead.


    219  CLOSE ON TRON                                                219


                               TRON
                    That's what my User wants, too...


    220  SHOT OF THE THREE FRIENDS                                    220


         holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. We see Tron
         and Ram looking at Flynn, in the center.


                               FLYNN
                    I know...


    221  CLOSE SHOT - FLYNN                                           221


         With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed
         around him.


    222  SHOT OF THE THREE BLUE CYCLES                                222


         ready to go.


    223  SHOT OF THE THREE CONSCRIPT CYCLES                           223


         also ready.


    224  SARK                                                         224


         His finger presses a button and the BUZZER SOUNDS again.


    225  SHOT FROM ABOVE OF ALL CYCLES TAKING OFF                     225


         We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. As we
         watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron
         and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other:


    226  OMIT                                                         226


    227  TRON'S POV                                                   227


         of the other cycle heading straight at him.


    228  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              228


         We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both
         turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing
         forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the
         arena.


                               FLYNN'S VOICE
                                (into mike)
                    Nice one!


    229  SHOT OF TRON AND HIS OPPONENT                                229


         They start making turns, passing walls they have already created,
         each trying to box the other in.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    Ram, stay all the way over ...


    230  CLOSE SHOT FROM THE SIDE - TRON                              230

         rushing forward.


    231  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           231

         turning.

                               RAM'S VOICE
                               (into mike)
                    I've got control. Go ahead.


    232  SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON'S CYCLE                           232


    233  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              233

         They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of
         the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the
         inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall.
         There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in
         the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
         dissolve as he does.

    234  SHOT OF FLYNN                                                234

         rushing alongside his opponent. They make a turn.

    235  CLOSE UP OF FLYNN                                            235

    236  LONG SHOT                                                    236

         They make another turn


    237  SHOT OF TWO CYCLES RUSHING                                   237

         right at the camera.


    238  FLYNN'S POV                                                  238

         of the maze of walls. He gets clear for a moment and spots the crack
         in the bulwark.

    239  CLOSE UP - HIS FACE                                          239

         reacting, getting an idea.

                               FLYNN
                            (into mike)
                    You guys...follow me.


    240  SHOT OF THE TWO CYCLES                                       240


         racing together, approaching the bulwark. At the last second, the
         Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack.


    241  SARK                                                         241


         observing this. With satisfaction. Now he will be rid of the User.


    242  FLYNN                                                        242


         He races straight at the crack... and through it.


    243  SARK                                                         243


         His face suffused with anger. He SLAMS a fist down on the console
         in front of him.


    244  LONG SHOT OF THE GRID                                        244


         The remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena.


    245  CLOSE UP - TRON                                              245


         reacting to Flynn's escape, hope in his eyes.


    246  ANGLE ON RAM                                                 246


         SMASHING another one of the Blue Warriors against a wall. He turns
         and races up next to Tron.


    247  SHOT OF THEM                                                 247


         side by side. They look at each other.


                               RAM

                    What do you think?

                    Do it!


    248  LONG SHOT                                                    248


         We see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We
         HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up:


                               VOICE
                      (through loudspeaker)
                    WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID.
                    REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE
                    GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING.


         We continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually
         diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies
         out altogether.

    249  SHOT OF TWO RECOGNIZERS                                      249

         moving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it.

    250  SHOT OF THE THREE ESCAPING CYCLES                            250


         racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room
         to get by. They emerge into an open corridor, with the Recognizers
         appearing overhead. We watch the cycles rush past the CAMERA...

    251  SARK                                                         251


         He is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out
         of his way.


                               SARK
                    Get them. Send out every Game
                    Tank in the Grid! Get them!

    252  SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN                                        252


         as he looks up and spots the Recognizers hovering over them, about
         to come down for the kill.

                            (into mike)
                    Watch it!

                    Recognizers!

    252A SHOT OF RAM                                                  252


         heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "Game Storage."

    253  SHOT FROM BEHIND                                             253

         as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked,
         way too big to fit through the opening.

    254  INT. WEAPONS STORAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS                       254


         FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with
         rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks
         REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes,
         and follow.


    255  EXT. MAZE                                                    255


         Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand
         Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with
         narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the
         ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come
         around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the
         face of the cliff. They stop for a moment.

    255A ANGLE ON FLYNN                                               255A

    256  CLOSE UP - TRON'S FACE                                       256

         listening.

                               TRON
                            (into mike)
                    Game Tanks! Come on

    257  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              257

         as the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the
         narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing
         from view.

    258  INT. OF THE CAVE                                             258


         We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
         darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a
         stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars
         between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh man...when you're on the other side
                    of the screen...it all looks so easy...


         Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and
         grinning, until all three are LAUGHING.


    259  DESERT LABYRINTH                                             259


         as the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft
         carrier hovering overhead.


    260  BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                               260


         Sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape.

                    Get the pursuit force back into 404A.
                    There's no place else they could be...


         Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark,
         where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible,
         moving through it. He turns to Sark.


                               LIEUTENANT
                              (confidently)
                    We'll have them in no time, sir. Long
                    before the interrupt interface.


                               SARK
                         (whirls on him)
                    We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if
                    the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
                    I want those programs!


    261  INT. CAVE                                                    261


         Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the
         cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a
         cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising
         from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.


                               FLYNN
                           (looking out)
                    It's all circuits...
                         (points at tower)
                    Must be an input/output component...


                               RAM
                    The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
                    remembered anything else about
                    yourself -- like what sector you're
                    from?


                               FLYNN
                           (sitting down
                          against a rock)
                    Well...my home "sector" was called
                    Paramus ...


                               RAM
                           (sits also)
                    PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
                    stand for ... (starts counting them
                    off on his fingers) ...probably Program
                    Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
                    a lovely place.


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    It grows on you.


         He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is
         gazing upwards.


                               TRON
                            (murmuring)
                    I can feel it ...


         Flynn and Ram turn.


                               FLYNN
                    Feel what? You okay?


                               RAM
                    Alan-One...


                               TRON
                    Yes... he's got something to tell me...


         Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.


                               RAM
                    You think we can make it there?


                               TRON
                    We have to.


                               FLYNN
                      (pointing to a corner
                           of the cave)
                    Hey, what's that?


         They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream
         can just be seen. Ram gets up.


                               RAM
                    it's just what we need.


    262  INT. NICHE                                                   262


         Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing,
         brilliant LIGHT.


                               TRON
                    Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
                    good fresh energy feels, till you get
                    to a pure source...
                            (to Flynn)
                    Have some...you'll need it.


         Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.


                               FLYNN
                         (wiping his mouth)
                    well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
                    Master Control?


         Tron and Ram are taken aback.


                               TRON
                    What, just the three of us?


                               FLYNN
                              (shrugs)
                    You know anybody that's got an army for
                    rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
                    to go take that sucker out. An' let's
                    face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
                    weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
                    while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
                    what does he care whether you guys get
                    killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
                    quarters?


                               RAM
                            (to Tron)
                    Do you know what he's talking about?


                               TRON
                            (to Flynn)
                    I have to find out what Alan wants...
                    that comes first.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
                    what to -


         Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    What's that?


                               TRON
                    Tanks...coming back. Let's go.


         With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the
         men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back
         into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.


 263-265 OMIT                                                         263-265

         The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible
         avenues of escape in the terrain below.


                               FLYNN
                              (points)
                    How about over there...that empty
                    memory?


                               TRON
                           (shakes head)
                    No good...they might block off the
                    old chip.
                             (points)
                    This way.


         The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
         the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
         EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.

         from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow
         arroyo.


    268  SHOT OF THE CYCLES                                           268


         They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
         entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
         narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
         to the edge of a gaping ravine.


         Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
         ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
         to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.


                               TRON'S VOICE
                    The bridge! Come on!


         The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,
         lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all
         three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
         turning the corner.

         Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches
         the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
         tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
         him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
         and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
         SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.


         He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
         below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.


         The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
         speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.

         Ram is badly injured, unconscious. Flynn struggles to his feet,
         sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him
         up.

         in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen
         behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from
         the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been
         blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his
         lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.

         speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for
         the cityscape tower in the distance.

         Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously
         moving in his direction.

    278  FLYNN AND RAM                                                278


         Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is
         getting darker.


                               FLYNN
                    You gonna make it?


         Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
         lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
         leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
         out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.


                                                   CUT TO:

         arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening.
         Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening
         and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.

    280  FLYNN AND RAM                                                280


         sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing. Ram is unconscious
         anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.

    281  FADE UP FROM BLACK                                           281


         Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a
         platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone.
         Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but
         then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn
         looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards
         the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy
         glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving
         it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and
         RUMBLE.


                               FLYNN
                           (holding onto

                      (looking around, weak)
                    We're inside a Recognizer...
                            (to Flynn)
                    You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --


                               FLYNN
                       (stumbling, trying to
                         keep his balance)
                    Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -


         Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the
         instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and
         shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and
         Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright
         position.

         Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.


         Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
         going fast.


                               FLYNN
                    You okay? You don't look so good.


         Ram nods weakly.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Hang on. We'll get you outta here.


         Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
         no result.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Damn! Never fails... minute the
                    warranty runs out...


                               RAM
                    Come here.


         Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
         Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
         Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey... !


                               RAM
                    Little more juice's all it needs...


         Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
         Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
         but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
         gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.


                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

         Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
         landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
         rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
         NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.


    285  TRON'S POV                                                   285


         A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.

         He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
         figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
         it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
         figure, dissolving it.


    287  CLOSE UP TRON'S FACE                                         287


         Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
         figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
         Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
         at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
         head sadly, but walks on.

    289  CLOSE UP - TRON IS FACE                                      289

         This is what he was looking for. He looks from side to side,
         figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the
         building stand a small group of the memory guards.

         Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.

    292  INT. RECOGNIZER - FLYNN                                      292

         This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
         sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
         then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
         One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
         gives a violent shake, then stops.


                               FLYNN
                    Never gonna figure out how to work
                    this thing...


         There's a NOISE from above. He looks up.


    293  HIS POV                                                      293


         We see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment.


    294  FLYNN                                                        294


         His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
         to be still examining things.


                                                   CUT TO:


    295  THE GLOW                                                     295


         Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying
         to get a look at Flynn. The BIT.


    296  WIDE SHOT                                                    296


         Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
         a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
         comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.


                               FLYNN
                    Okay -- hold it right there!


         The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
         recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
         sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:


                               BIT
                    Yes!


         The Bit subsides into energy form again.


                               FLYNN
                        (still suspicious)
                    What do you mean, "'yes"?


                               BIT
                    Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.


         From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character,
         red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops
         speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.


                               FLYNN
                    That all you can say?


                               BIT
                         (of course not,
                         you know better)
                    No, nyet, negatory, not on your
                    tintype, no way.


                               FLYNN
                    Oh. Anything else?


                               BIT
                    Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.


                               FLYNN
                    only yes and no...
                             (it dawns)
                    You're a bit.


                               BIT
                             (hippie)
                    For sure...


                               FLYNN
                    where's your program? Won't it miss you?


                               BIT
                            (confused)
                    No...


         Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm your program?


                               BIT
                            (emphatic)
                    Right on the money!


                               FLYNN
                              (sighs)
                    Another mouth to feed... you don't by any
                    chance know how to drive this crate?


         In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
         platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
         stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
         grabs the cross-bar.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Like so?


         Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer,
         and it takes off like a bat out of hell


 297-298 OMIT                                                         297-298

         heading for the city. It lurches forward unevenly, crashing drunkenly
         into a wall and bouncing off another one.

    303  INT. SIMULATION HANGER COMPLEX                               303


         This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
         inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
         of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
         elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
         partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
         We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
         only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
         interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
         Tron looks farther down the corridor.

         We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards
         Tron.

         as he moves back against the wall, into a niche.


         As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
         grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
         The line of workers mechanically files on past.


         We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
         his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
         half-heartedly.


                               TRON
                    I'm not gonna hurt you.


         She stops struggling.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    I'm going to let you go now... don't
                    scream, or I'll be very sorry.


         His hands loosen, and he releases her.

         We see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first
         time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face,
         still beautiful in its pallor.


                               TRON
                    Put your hand behind your back.


         Slowly she obeys.

         He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is
         made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we
         watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into
         her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.


                               GIRL
                    TRON!!


         She throws her arms around him.

         She-looks around nervously.

                             his hand)
                    This way. Come on.


         They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs.

         Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see
         the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings,
         and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they
         hear snatches of conversation.

                    I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...

         Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls
         him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air.

         Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
         She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.

    314  INT. YORI'S APARTMENT                                        314


         As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
         window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
         looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
         walls and floors.

                               YORI
                    My quarters.

                               YORI
                    It's a flat. But wait a micro...


         She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
         a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
         the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
         three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
         charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
         the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
         aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.

         With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
         extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
         shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
         diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
         her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
         by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
         Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.


                               YORI
                    Come here.

         His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
         being fully rewarded for his efforts.


                               TRON
                    You're beautiful, Yori.

         as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
         flattened palms.


         Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
         glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.


                               YORI
                    You've grown, big program.


                               TRON
                    I had to...in the games...


         They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All
         the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto
         what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
         room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
         other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
         moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
         trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
         are enveloped in the cloud of stars...

    322  INT. RECOGNIZER                                              322


         Flynn is having trouble controlling the Reco.


                               FLYNN
                    This honey doesn't handle so good
                    in town...


                               BIT
                            (agreeing)
                    No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!


         He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
         light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
         only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
         shouting:


                               BIT
                    Ix-nay! Noper! Under no conditions -


         Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that
         he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it.


                               BIT
                           (that's more
                             like it)
                    Right, confirmed, I couldn't have
                    put it -

         as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop... but the head of it,
         with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air,
         landing in what looks like a garbage dump.


                                                   CUT TO:

         as Flynn shakily pulls himself out of the debris, the Bit nervously
         hovering over him.


                               FLYNN
                              (to Bit)
                    Catch me listening to you again.

         A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
         from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
         his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
         they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see
         him.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine.
                    Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks
                    for your concern. So long.


         They move on.


                               FLYNN
                            (to the Bit)
                    This town's full o' live ones.


                               BIT
                    Not a chance.


    328  EXT. CITY PLAZA                                              328


         Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
         the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear
         bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.


                               PROGRAMS
                    I have to re-route the insurance
                    information bits... Next cycle we
                    start the war game simulation for
                    the MCP... Did you make that accounts
                    receivable adjustment for Sark...
                    Certainly... the MCP wants only
                    minimal functions left in Sector 84Q.


    329  EXT. THE BASE OF THE I/0 TOWER                               329


         It looms high overhead.


    330  TRON AND YORI                                                330


         on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
         approaching a wide door in the wall.


    331  INSIDE THIS DOOR'                                            331


         We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
         rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
         and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.


    332  SHOT FROM BELOW THEM                                         332

         looking upwards as they move.

    333  THE UPPER FLOOR                                              333


         as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
         sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
         dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
         preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
         the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
         sharp, angular surfaces.  On this second story there is floor and
         ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
         and beyond.


         Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
         a door into the inner parts of the Tower.

    350  THE CENTRAL CHAMBER                                          350


         of the I/0 Tower. A large, raised circular altar stands against one
         wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
         supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.


         In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
         steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
         suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
         priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
         still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
         from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
         opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
         each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
         upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
         only blackness beyond.


    351  DUMONT'S FACE                                                351

         Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide
         room, their footsteps ECHOING.

    375  CENTRAL CHAMBER - TRON, YORI, DUMONT                         375

         Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.


                               YORI
                             (quietly)
                    Dumont... ?


         The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't
         recognize either one.


                               DUMONT
                    Yes?


                               TRON
                             (nervous)
                    I... have come to communicate with
                    my User.


                               DUMONT
                    Hmm. A difficult proposition...
                    difficult proposition at best.
                       (indicates empty chamber)
                    Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
                    exactly packing them in these days ...


                               YORI
                    Yes...what--?


                               DUMONT
                    You know, not so long ago, you
                    could've come in here and seen
                    programs lined up all the way back
                    to those doors, waiting for communion
                    with their Users. The building fund
                    was doing well too...but now...
                               (sighs)
                    ...this so-called Master Control
                    Program is going around cutting
                    programs off from their natural
                    creators, grabbing all our believers
                    and making them ride around on little
                    motor scooters and shoot things at
                    each other and Weiner knows what all--
                    oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
                    of faith...


                               TRON
                    Well I want to communicate --

                               DUMONT
                    Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
                    get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
                    you in here. They hate this tower.
                    They'd close it down if they dared
                    to but they keep me around, in case
                    one of them wants to deal with the
                    other world once in a while. And
                    you should hear the way they commune!
                    Sounds like they were routing a
                    payroll, for all the heart they put
                    in it. No, I don't think you


         Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.


                               TRON
                    Dumont... my User has information
                    that could -- could make this a
                    free system again.


                               DUMONT
                    Hah.


                               TRON
                    Really. You'd have programs lined
                    up around the block to use this
                    place -- and no MCP looking over your
                    shoulder.


                               DUMONT
                               (sighs)
                    When you've been in the system as long
                    as I have, you hear many promises...
                    many reassurances...many brave plans...


         He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:


                               DUMONT (CONT.)
                           (falling into ritual)
                    Who is your User, program?


                               TRON
                    Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?


                               DUMONT
                    All that is visible must grow beyond
                    itself and extend into the realm of
                    the invisible.


         Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.


                               DUMONT
                    You may pass, my friend.


         Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness
         beyond.

         We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring
         curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets.

    377  A CORRIDOR IN THE TOWER. A CORNER.                           377


         We see a face peer around it. Flynn.


                               FLYNN
                    This is where Tron said he was going...


         Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
         the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
         down the hall, Bit following.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    Looks like his kind of place, too...
                    real serious.


         CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR
         the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the
         corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.

         Sark... and a force of guards and six Blue Warriors. Sark is in

         going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is
         trapped.

         seen. Sark marches TOWARDS THE CAMERA, right into it.

         The file of men is moving away. We can see that there is a wide ledge
         about ten feet up the wall, containing the lighting source.

         lifting his staff.

         Flynn looks up AT THE CAMERA, finger to his lips.

         We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning
         over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn
         places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue

         We see that he is standing in front of the huge, closed door to the
         I/0 Tower central chamber. The guards have formed two long rows, and
         Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side.


                               SARK
                    That old fruitcake Dumont...
                    he'll pay for this.

    392  THE HEART OF THE TOWER                                       392


         We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
         golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
         surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
         Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.


    393  INT. COMMUNICATION BELL                                      393


         Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
         which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
         sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
         surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
         this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
         within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
         down, and then up.


    394  HIS POV                                                      394


         The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening.


    395  FROM THE OPENING                                             395


         We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
         into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
         inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
         above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
         his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
         knowledge of the experience to come.


    396  A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP.            396


         He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
         high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
         happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
         light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
         illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
         force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped
         from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source
         of the light.


    397  TRON'S FACE FROM ABOVE                                       397

         hands drop to his sides. The disk rises out of sight, and we

    399  EXT. CENTRAL CHAMBER - DOOR                                  399


         A machine, floating above the floor, with a pointed cone facing the
         door, is switched on, and a blast of pure electricity leaps from it
         to the surface of the door with the SOUND of sizzling LIGHTNING

         Tron is looking upwards. Suddenly a voice booms out, echoing, and
         distorted, Alan's voice.


                               ALAN V.0.
                    TRON... TRON... Location query...

                    cut off again...


         In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting,
         transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light
         at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
         bright light at the center.


         We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the
         others dim.


                               ALAN (V.0.)

         consumed by static.

         He stops.


         The voice is gone. The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and
         gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It
         slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it,
         pulls it down and stares at it.

         He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the
         neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he
         has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming
         winglike supports for the fabric.


                               DUMONT
                    I have waited for this moment many
                    thousands of cycles. It is time for the
                    new order to begin... The Users are
                    waiting.


         As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly.
         Then he holds out his hand to Yori.

         of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots
         of light.

    419  A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER, RISING WITH TRON         419
         AND YORI

         We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
         designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
         enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
         move with the speed of light.  The sail is at the bow of the craft,
         and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
         made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
         look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
         transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
         information paths to the Central Processing Unit.

                    why the User abandoned the project...


         The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center,
         forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked
         into place.

    430  WALKWAY OF SAILER                                            430


         as guards start swarming on board. We see Tron move forward and then
         stop, letting them come.

         looking down at the walkway. Beyond it we can see the great door
         starting to rise.

    432  TRON                                                         432


         throwing his disk. It smashes into the guards in front, tossing them
         backwards.

    433  A SHOT FROM THE EXTERIOR OF THE HANGAR                       433


         The great door is almost all the way up. We can see the Sail with
         its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are
         racing towards the hangar.


    434  TRON                                                         434


         Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
         We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
         connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
         guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
         There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
         his balance.


    435  YORI                                                         435


         smiling.

                    We're off!

         The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,
         from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that
         it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
         accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
         seconds.


    437  EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - BRIDGE - SARK & MCP                  437

         Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In
         front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and
         the Solar Sailer -- racing away.


                               MCP
                    I hope you've enjoyed being a command
                    program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
                    working in a pocket calculator... maybe
                    one of those watches that plays "Happy
                    Birthday" to its User once a year.


                               SARK
                    Now, sir... We did take care of that
                    User you sent us --


                               MCP
                    Yes, and now you've got two renegade
                    programs running all the hell over the
                    system in a stolen simulation.


                               SARK
                    We'll get them, sir... These things
                    take time.


                               MCP
                    I don't have time, Sark. And neither
                    do you. End of line.

         from the stern. Tron picks himself up from the floor where he was
         thrown when the Sailer took off, and heads for Yori (at the camera).
         He stops, seeing something.


                               YORI V.O.
                    Tron, are you all right?


         Tron waves at her... then...


    441  CLOSE SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON                             441


         He looks over at the guard rail.

         Several yards away from it. We see one of the blue warriors hanging
         on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the
         edge, look over and see this guard.


    444  CLOSE SHOT OF TRON                                           444


         By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot. Tron raises his
         disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing
         shape comes into the frame from bottom right.

    447  SIDE SHOT OF THEM BOTH                                       447

                               FLYNN
                    Yeah, I... oops!


         He loses his grip, and starts to fall. But Tron, just in time, grabs
         Flynn's wrist and starts to pull him up. We see the blue static guard
         disguise fade off Flynn.


    449  YORI                                                         449

         leaning over the control console anxiously, watching Tron come up
         the steps towards her with Flynn and the Bit.

                    Who is this?


         We see Flynn look at Yori and silently mouth "Lora" in surprise...
         but then realize his mistake.


                               TRON
                             (smiling)
                    Flynn...

                          Flynn eagerly)
                    Where's Ram?


                               FLYNN
                    I'm sorry, Tron... he's...
                    he didn't make it.


         Tron shakes his head, sadly.


                               TRON
                             (to Yori)
                    This is Flynn... the one who
                    busted me out.

                            (to Flynn)
                    Then I owe you some thanks...


                               FLYNN
                    No big deal. I ought to know my way
                    around that Light Cycles routine...
                    I mean, I did write the program for it.


                               TRON
                            (mystified)
                    Wrote the...?


                               FLYNN
                    It's time I levelled with you, Tron.
                    I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a
                    User.


         Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.


                               YORI
                    A User -- in our world?

                               (nods)
                    Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...


                               TRON
                    But -- if you're a User -- then
                    everything you've done has been
                    part of a plan ...


                               FLYNN
                              (laughs)
                    You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
                    to think since I got down here. I mean
                    in here. Out here. Whatever.


                               TRON
                    Then...


                               FLYNN
                    Look, you guys know how it is. You just
                    keep doin' what it looks like you're
                    supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
                    you hope to hell your User knows what's
                    goin' on.


                               TRON
                    Well -- that's how it is for programs,
                    yes, but --


                               FLYNN
                    I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the
                    time, that's how it is for Users, too.


                               TRON

                    So... Nice ship you got here. What's our
                    next move?

                    Remember you wanted to pay a call on
                    the MCP?


         Flynn nods.


                               TRON (CONT.)
                    We're on our way.

                    All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake,
                    at least.

         from behind.

                               LIEUTENANT
                    Sir, what do you want done with
                    the tower guardian, Dumont?
                    Put him with the others?


                               SARK
                    No, bit brain.

         Sark turns to face him.


                               SARK


                    Prepare him for inquisition. I need
                    a little relaxation. But first rez up
                    the carrier for pursuit... And one other
                    thing.


         lie stares at the lieutenant, paranoid


                               SARK
                           (continuing)
                    Don'tthink anymore. I do the
                   thinkingaround here.

         We see Flynn looking back the way they came. Yori is at the controls,
         with Tron beside her, his arm around her shoulders, looking at Flynn.

                               FLYNN
                    What about our friend - Sark?


                               TRON
                    Probably decided not to pursue us,
                    The Sea of Simulation is tricky..
                    lot of illusions...rough navigating.
                    Programs have a way of just...
                    disappearing here.

                               FLYNN
                    Not us, I hope.

                          indicates disk)
                    Not with this disk. I'm going to
                    check on the beam connection, Yori.
                    You two can keep a watch out for
                    grid bugs.


         He moves off down the walkway, the Bit following. Flynn turns and
         leans out over the side.


                               FLYNN
                    Boy the view from up here... you

         We see an area of darkened, gloomy, two-dimensional shapes.

                              (sadly)
                    The MCP blasted it... There are very
                    few domains left with any power at all.

                    they're the same wherever you go.

    462  INT. DIMLY LIT CELL                                          462


         Where we see Dumont plugged into energy foot sockets. Two memory
         guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest.
         Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his
         expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of
         torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA
         PULLS BACK AND ANGLES UP to the second level where we see Sark
         looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell.

                    an old program.

                    Yes, I'm old.

                    Old enough to remember the MCP when he
                    was just a chess program. He started
                    small, and he'll end small.

                         head and laughs)
                    That's very funny, Dumont. Maybe I
                    should keep you around, just to make me
                    laugh.

    468  THE DECK OF THE SOLAR SAILER                                 466


         We see Tron at the bow. Flynn and Yori are up on the deck near the
         controls, with the Bit hovering over them. Yori is, pointing
         something out to Flynn.

         reacting to the sight of something ahead of the Solar Sailer.


    470  LONG SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                      470


         We see the transmission beam which carries the Solar Sailer
         increasing in brightness, throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing
         energy, coming towards the ship. It hits the sail, and the ship
         shivers. The whole beam is now tripled in brightness.

         As Tron runs up to Yori's side. He grabs her shoulder, pulling her
         against him... they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the
         increasing beam.


                               TRON
                            (shouting)

                    Power surge... the transmission beam's
                    too strong!


                               TRON
                    We have to get off this beam!


                               YORI
                             (frantic)

         The ship is throbbing and jerking, bits of it de-rezzing.


    474  DECK OF SOLAR SAILER                                         474


         Flynn looks around, points to one side.


                               FLYNN
                    There's another beam!


                               YORI
                    It's too far!


         Flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship, makes a decision, and
         races forward.

         We see Flynn race to the bow, where the horrendous power of the beam
         is blasting away at the sails. He slows down, but keeps going.

                    The beam connection...
                    but he'll be de-rezzed!!

    478  SHOT IN FRONT OF SOLAR SAILER, FACING THE BOW                478


         We see Flynn emerge, leaning out into the beam, his face brilliantly
         illuminated by the beam. He reaches forward with one arm.

         He is lying spread eagled at the bow, with one arm in the light. He
         raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but
         too far to reach. Suddenly his whole body glows with the same
         intensity as the beam.

         from his arm.

         We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring
         transmission beam and connect. We see the ship pulsing, and then
         breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting
         to the safe beam.

         The craft starts to travel safely on its way.

         as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn. We can
         see Yori's anxious face to one side. Flynn's head comes up for a
         moment, dazed.

                               FLYNN
                              (weakly)

                    Yes.


         Flynn smiles weakly.


                               FLYNN
                    Hooray for our side...


         He faints.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

         Yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with Flynn
         stretched out beside her, his head in her lap. Her hands are on
         either side of his face. Tron is seated across from them and the Bit
         is quietly floating beside him. In b.g. we SEE that the Solar Sailer
         is passing through a series of narrow canyons.


                               FLYNN

         catching hold of something. He is swinging freely. Hanging onto a

         of cell. Yori rushes forward to Dumont. We see Flynn standing just
         inside the door, shoulders slumped and we can see that his disk has
         been removed.

         Dumont holds Yori as she SOBS.


                               DUMONT
                    Quietly, Yori...


         He looks up.


                               DUMONT
                            (continuing)
                    Tron... ?


         Flynn looks down at his hands and turns away, leaning against the
         wall.


                               YORI
                    He's dead.


                               DUMONT
                           (sighs, looks
                             at Flynn)
                    And who is this?


                               YORI
                    He's a User, Dumont. He came to
                    our world... trying to help us...


         Her voice breaks, she turns away.


                               DUMONT
                            (despairing)
                    If the Users can no longer help us...


         His voice trails off. Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the
         cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the
         cell door.


                               SARK
                    So... we have erased the program that -


         As he catches sight of Flynn, his voice falters.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You! No!


         Flynn looks up curiously.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    You died! I saw you!


                               FLYNN
                    Not me, boss.


                               SARK
                    Well... we can take care of that
                    soon enough.


         He points to Dumont. The guards grab him.


                               SARK (CONT.)
                    Take this program to the holding pit.


         The guards start to drag Dumont out.


                               YORI
                        (rushing after him)
                    Dumont...!


         A guard pushes her roughly to the end of the cell.


                               SARK
                        (indicates Dumont)
                    I'm taking our friend here, and
                    some other religious fanatics, to
                    Master Control... the MCP has expressed
                    an interest in assimilating them --
                    probably for archival purposes.
                    I'm not going back to the Game Grid
                    on this ship, though -- I'll take
                    the Transport Beam.
                             (smiles)
                    Less traffic. But when I disembark,
                    this ship...and everything that remains
                    on board...will automatically de-rez.
                    This means you.

                    Enjoy your trip...


         LAUGHING, Sark leaves. The guards, with Dumont in custody, follow.


    533  SHOT LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PIT CELLS                         533


         into the cell that holds a dozen dejected, defeated, aging programs,
         the I/0 Tower guardians. We see the door to the cell open and guards
         beginning to herd them out.


    534  ANGLE - LEVEL ABOVE CELLS                                    534

         into the cells at his feet and laughs again.

         vast plain covered with a glowing grid.


    540  EXT. BRIDGE AREA OF CARRIER                                  540


         We can see the observation port and below that a section of the
         ship's structure is moving forward.

         As the landing pod disengages completely, floating away from the
         carrier and then starting its final journey to the MCP, picking up
         speed on a straight and even course. We can see a small speck
         clinging to one side of the pod...

         TRON, holding himself braced into a narrow crack.


    544  FLYNN, YORI AND THE BIT                                      544


         Yori is sitting with her head in her hands. Flynn is at the door
         testing it, running his finger along the edges.


    545  LONG SHOT                                                    545


         Of landing pod flying over the glowing grid that surrounds the MCP's
         mesa.

         Steep cliff face of the MCP's mesa is coming closer and closer, more
         and more detail visible.

         tiny against the massive bulk of the MCP's mesa, descending for
         landing. The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular
         shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes,
         fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the
         structure.

         There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From
         the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly.
         Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we
         gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at
         the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming
         black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam
         rises out of the center of this cylinder.

         Flynn still at the door. Suddenly his hand goes right through the
         door.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey!


         The door is disappearing, dissolving.


                               FLYNN
                       (continuing; turning)
                    Look, the door's almost...


         He stops in horror.


                                                   CUT TO:


    552  HIS POV                                                      552


         Yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them.
         She is de-rezzing too. Her whole body becoming transparent. She looks
         up dimly at Flynn, with no expression.


    553  WIDE SHOT                                                    553


         Flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging
         her close, his energy flowing into her.


         Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is
         too late to save her. Her eyes are half-closed.


                               FLYNN
                    Yori!


    554  CLOSE SHOT                                                   554


         Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch.
         Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color
         floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
         Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.


                               YORI
                             (in awe)
                    You... you brought me back...?
                    Why...? How ... ?


         Flynn lets go of her.


                               FLYNN
                    I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!


         He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs
         to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers.
         Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration.
         Suddenly the Bit pops into life.


                               BIT
                    Yes!


                               FLYNN
                    Let's get outta here.


         They head for the door.


    555  THE MESA TOP OF THE MCP                                      555

         The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading
         them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger.
         The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the
         path.

    556  EXT. POD DOOR - LIEUTENANT                                   556


         on duty. He hears a NOISE and turns... and in a flash of light a
         speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES
         over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its
         arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.

    557  CLOSER SHOT                                                  557

         It is Tron. He steps over the body of the Lieutenant.

         from right outside. We see the prisoners beginning to file inside,
         up the final slope leading to the base of the MCP.

         watching them, his back to the camera.

    560  POV OF THE DOOMED PROGRAMS                                   560


         As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
         beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
         finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
         network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
         surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
         the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
         impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
         but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
         inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
         continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
         STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
         the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.


                               MCP
                      (echoing, booming)
                    I am delighted that so many of you
                    could turn out to give your
                    power over to me...

         them starting to de-rez.

                    You're very lucky, all of you. You

                    the history of the system... of all
                    systems...


         The programs begin to disappear, one by one.

         Flynn and Yori race into view. We can see two of the memory guards
         in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in
         the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out
         the window.

                    Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
                    finally come to terms with one
                    another...

         Sark is standing, looking in the opening, waiting for the signal to
         depart. His back is to the camera.

                               VOICE
                    SARK!


         Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..


    570  SARK'S POV                                                   570


         We SEE Tron standing, legs spread, arms poised by his sides, disk in
         one hand. It gives off a pure white light.


    571  CLOSE UP SARK'S FACE                                         571


                               SARK
                    I don't know how you survived,
                    slave.


    572  WIDE SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                      572


                               SARK
                    It doesn't matter. Prepare to
                    terminate.

         Sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist.

    573  SHOT FROM ABOVE                                              573


         as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks
         under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks
         again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the
         two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and
         races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.

         He looks out sees something, does a double-take, looks again

                               FLYNN
                    Let's get some power here.


         His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great
         pulses of glowing energy into the carrier.

         Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice. Sark deflects it and
         immediately throws his own disk.


    580  SHOT OF TWO WEAPONS                                          580

         as the two disks come at him.


                               TRON
                    I'm also better than you....


         He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as
         Sark's disk passes under him.


    582  SHOT OF SARK'S DISK                                          582

         As he slams his own disk into Sark's, using his as a shield.

                               SARK
                    Very clever, Tron. You know you
                    should have joined me.


    585  OVERHEAD POV                                                 585


         Tron hurls again.


    586  FLYNN AND YORI                                               586


         Flynn is at the controls, transferring power.


                               FLYNN
                    Any response?

                    It's starting


         She looks down at the battle. Her hand reaches over and grips
         Flynn's tightly.

         He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind,
         and holds up his own disk as a shield.


                               SARK
                    We would have made a great team.


    588  TRON'S DISK                                                  588


         turning sideways in its flight, edge on.

         With a CRASH and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through
         Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head. The disk shatters, and we
         see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the
         disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. We can see
         energy pouring out of this wound like blood.

                    It is very good that you...

         framed in the doorway.


                               TRON
                    I don't think it is good for you, MCP.

                               TRON
                    Sark's out. Would you like to
                    leave a message?


                               MCP
                    I am the message. The only message.
                    Sark!


         Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and
         returns to him.

                          (continuing)

         As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over
         to him.


    599  CLOSE SHOT - WALL                                            599


         Dumont is transparent. Tron runs up to him.


                               TRON
                          (trying to pull
                       Dumont away from wall)

         Tron throws.

         The voice reverberates, shaking the chamber. Tron continues to throw.

         Sark's dead hand. We see the circuit pattern of the mesa top begin
         to glow around the hand, throbbing with energy. The hand moves.


    604  TRON                                                         604


         throwing again at the MCP, hitting, catching his disk again.

         It is vacant, staring with white eyes. His head still has the gaping
         hole in the forehead. He's a zombie, the living dead. He rises.

         Carrier floating over the CPU, near the MCP's beam. Flynn looks out,
         from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. He spots the
         beam.

         Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
         goes up to him.


                               YORI

         He takes her in his arms.

                               (whispering)
                    I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if...
                    just once...


         His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
         change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
         love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.

         then open.

         He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
         on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
         shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.

         Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
         directly into the center of MCP itself.


    617  INT. MCP                                                     617


         Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
         his voice is that of the MCP.


                               SARK/MCP
                    End of line, program...


         We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
         static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
         Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
         Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
         and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
         and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
         cones. And connects.


    618  SHOT OF THE APEX                                             618

         A brilliant explosion of lights bursts out.


    619  SHOT OF SARK                                                 619


         Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
         into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.


    620  SHOT OF THE MCP                                              620


         We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
         is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
         padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
         wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
         see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
         too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
         the MCP glows brighter and brighter.


    621  YORI AND THE BIT                                             621

         on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this.

    622  HER POV                                                      622

         A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the
         camera.

    623  YORI                                                         623

         shielding her face from the power of the blast.

    624  LONG SHOT                                                    624


         The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow
         returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates,
         leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.

    625  YORI                                                         625


         still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains
         regaining their life.

    626  HER POV                                                      626

         one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows
         brightly, increasing.

    627  LONG SHOT                                                    627

         The carrier starts to descend.

                                                   CUT TO:


    628  EXT. CPU MESA - TRON                                         628

         Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
         programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending.

    629  SHOT OF CARRIER                                              629

         Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very
         faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.

    630  EXT. CPU MESA                                                630

         Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
         her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his
         in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.

                               TRON
                            (laughing)
                    Nice...

                               YORI
                    It's something Users do.

                               TRON
                    Where's Flynn?

         He looks up at the bridge.

                               YORI
                    He's gone. He went into the beam.
                    He saved you. He saved all of us.

         Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at
         the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.

                               DUMONT
                    He really was a User...

                               BIT
                         (quietly, sadly)
                    Yes...

    631  LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD                                      631

         of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a
         shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    632  RACING OVER THE CIRCUIT PATTERN                              632


         and returning to the real world.


    633  THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB                                   633


         CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
         blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.


         WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
         chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.


         Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
         shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
         back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
         himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.


         He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
         flesh and blood.


         He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
         weak sunlight coming in.


         And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
         Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
         coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.


         Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
         document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
         face.


         The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
         tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.


                                                   CUT TO:


    634  INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA                           634


         Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's
         CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.


                               FLYNN
                    Hey -- you guys


         Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up
         a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.


                               ALAN
                    Flynn! I made it. I worked out some
                    new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk,
                    and -- it's running.


                               FLYNN
                    I know, I met him.


         Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
         from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.


                               FLYNN (CONT.)
                    I mean, I saw it read-up -
                    hey, look at this.


         He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
         reading it to figure out its significance.


                               ALAN
                    Your old files -- ?


                               FLYNN
                    And Dillinger's instructions to
                    divert them -- it's all there -
                    look, even his home phone number,
                    when he logged on.


                               ALAN
                    Oh, that is beautiful. You've got
                    the goods...


         Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora
         get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.


                               FLYNN
                    You're telling me...


         As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
         on it.


    635  CRT SCREEN                                                   635


         The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and
         are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
         typical video game:


         A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
         electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
         first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
         directions.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    you have any idea how much I can sue these
                    jokers for?


                               LORA (V.0.)
                    Well, just don't forget your old friends
                    when you're rich and famous.


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
                    this joint by then...


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                   Your friend Dillinger sure won't...


         The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
         EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
         SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
         formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
         HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.


                               FLYNN (V.O.)
                    Hey, you know anybody who wants to
                    get hold of some video games... cheap?


                               LORA (V.O.)
                    You're getting out of the business?


                               ALAN (V.O.)
                    Shouldn't you wait till your
                    lawsuit's settled?


                               FLYNN (V.0.)
                    Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
                    video games to last me a good long
                    time. I feel like gettin' into some
                    real life...


         at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
         yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
         HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and


                                                        BLACK OUT.

    Electric-neon netherworld.     Pulsing chromatics over jet black.

    CONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS.
    CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded "X-NET".

    3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New,
    unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides,
    crossing cyberspace.

    X-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every
    inch.


2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

    DATA "TRAIN" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off,
    shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect
    lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points.

    X-Takks notice, moving to investigate.

    DEEP IN THE LATTICE:

    Red data "uploads" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see
    from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic
    detail, lethal EDGES -

    Then slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry
    eyes, riveted to a TASK -

    TRON 2.0.

    Seriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The
    friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a
    ruthless cyber-ninja.

    X-Takks search ten story gantries.

    TRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding
    detection. Slips into:


3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT

    X-Takks on high alert.

    TRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts
    behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY.

    Pulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY.

    TRON inserts key in and ENCRYPTION PANEL.     Circuits energize.
    Shockwave quakes system.

    POWER SUPPLY OVERLOADS, SHORTING OUT.

                              X-TAKKS
                 Intruder!   Fix coordinates!

    POLICE POUNCE, FIRING.

    Tron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT -

    DISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets,
    brutally accurate, takes out three more Police -

    TRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for
    him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate.
    DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts.

    ALARMS WAIL -

    POWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS.
    X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY
    STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted.

    TRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks -

    Arriving on the scene - split-second response:

    Elite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by:

    RX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH).

    TRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his
    DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA
    CHANNEL -

    RX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles,
    hotly pursuing TRON.

    TRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls
    across cyberspace.

                             AGENT 1
                 This is the first time an Intruder

4   INT.   X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY

    Broadband, light-speed OPTIK HIGHWAY.     Empty, except for:

    TRON - accelerating, escaping.

    Rx23 and AGENTS catch up fast on Pulse Rider Vehicles.

    TRON throws his disk. Blings off Agents - triggers CRASH.
    PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall.

    Rx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing.


5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE

    TRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into
    ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE.

    Rx23 roars after him, riding hard, joined by:

    Airborne SEARCH ENGINE vehicle, piloted by a dumpy nerd
    program called KROD.

                           KROD
               I got a lock. Coordinate 32937!

                             RX23
               I'm on him!

    RX23 chases Tron into a dark canyon. Hairpin turns and blind
    curves. RX23 arrives a junction. Tron has vanished.

                           RX23
               Which way did he go?!


6   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY

    Rabbit warren of computer programmers in crisis mode.

    A head shoots up from a cubicle. It's Rush Nortebi, 23,
    computer security expert. Real world version of the RX23
    program. His cubicle is jammed with racks of vintage and
    bleeding-edge computer gear.

                           RUSH
               I said WHICH WAY DID HE GO?

    Dozens of programmers work feverishly to track the system
    intruder. Everybody's stumped. Dangling from desk lamps,
    the company toy: Conical pyramid with a square stuck on top,
    labeled "X-NET RULES!"

                 Check the old game grid!

    Rush jockeys an old Apple LISA computer.     On screen: a crude
    old vector graphics game grid.

    A RED FIGURE steps appears the grid.

                             RUSH
                 You get a cookie, Miles!

    Programmers gather to watch Rush in action.


7   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - THE OLD GAME GRID

    Vast, low-rez, uncool, largely forgotten.

    TRON pulls a LIGHT WAND from his legging, grips it. A TURBO-
    CHARGED LIGHT-CYCLE rezzes up beneath him. He fires his
    LIGHTCYCLE. ZIP, he's gone.

    Onto the grid blasts RX23, speeding on his Pulse rider.    He
    skids and swerves, learning the funky surface.

    The chase is on.

    TRON escapes across the vast grid-plane, head down, eyes
    hollow. He gains speed, retreating to somewhere...

    RX23 surges on his Pulse Rider, closing the gap.

    Rush gets the hang of this old game.

                             RUSH
                 I haven't played this since I was 4.
                 But I was mighty awesome.

                  Or you know we're all fired.

     Rush baits the RED LIGHTCYCLE. It anticipates his every
     move, goading him, tailing him.

                              MILES
                  Whoa, Rush! I groked a pattern in

     Tron pulls away, baiting his opponent.

     RX23's Pulse Rider SCREAMS, gaining on Tron.         Neck-and-neck.

     But Tron suddenly brakes, quitting the chase.

     RX23 is puzzled.    Looks forward.       Eyes spring wide.

     Eyes land on withering LEGAL VP.

                  Change it back to the way I wrote
                  it. With the launch of X-Net, this
                  company guarantees one hundred percent
                  secure data transmission. If we
                  can't deliver on that promise, we
                  deserve to be out of business.

     Rush appears from a building.       Signals Sinclair aside.

     Sprawling, big bucks, basketball hoop.

     Sinclair enters, alone. Closes door. Uses a retinal scan
     ID to access his computer. Secure connection opens. As he

     LONE FIGURE stands clothed in flashy cyber-armor:     Fluid
     photons, oozing high-rez circuitry.

     It's PLEXOR, cyber-twin of real-world Sinclair.

     He crosses into an round inner sanctum.    DATA STREAM radiates
     from above.

     PLEXOR stands in the center, pulls his DISK off his back,
     raises it above his head.

     Data stream converges onto disk, becomes a tight RUBY RED
     COMMUNICATION BEAM.

     Plexor's eyes decode transmission.    Text races across his
     eyes: IDENTIFY THE INTRUDER.

                  somebody - some hacker, some
                  competitor, somebody - just proved
                  they're smarter than us. Breaking
                  into X-Net is theoretically

                  At a time like this, let's seek

                  departed leader, Flynn.

     Rudy sheepishly sits.

     But Sinclair stops behind Rudy, eyes fixed on the photo of

                  Rush, you're the only one I can trust
                  to eliminate the intruder. But you
                  won't be doing it the way you thought.
                  Meg's been working on something down
                  here that's, well... Beyond Top
                  Secret.

     Rush drills a look at Meg, but she keeps it all business.


26   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER

     Out the elevator, Meg leads them into a maze of ultra-tech
     gear.

                              MEG
                  This is where Flynn worked.   And
                  where he died.

     Amid sleek new equipment, there's a glass cabinet housing a
     CHARRED REMNANT of strange machinery.

                              SINCLAIR
                  Meg has reconstructed Flynn's last
                  project. This time it works.

     Mega signals lab assistant DEWEY. He pokes buttons:       A
     MASSIVE TECHNICAL DEVICE unfolds and boots up.

                              RUSH
                  You didn't pick this up at Circuit
                  City. What is it?

                              MEG
                  A Quantum Digitizer. Prototype,
                  only one of its kind. Flynn designed
                  it to break down physical objects
                  into high resolution data. Luckily,
                  we salvaged his key components and
                  back-engineered the system.

     She opens a cage, places her LAB RAT (Jo-Jo) on a target
     stage. Dewey boots controls, presses commands. Beam array
     scans the rat into the computer, forming a 3D rat-image on
     screens, dematerializing the physical rat. Device revs down.

     Rush runs his hand over the empty target stage.

                               RUSH
                  That's...   Not possible.

     Lab rat has vanished from the physical world.     Its digitized
     image rotates on monitors.

                              MEG
                  Flynn was trying to take it one step
                  further. He wanted to transport a
                  human being into cyberspace.

                              RUSH
                  You mean the urban legends? A
                  computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace
                  a long time ago.

                              SINCLAIR
                  We think it happened.

     Meg agrees.    Rush gets a chill.

                              SINCLAIR
                  It was a fluke. But Flynn worked
                  for years, down here, trying to make
                  it happen again. One day a test
                  went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed
                  this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash.

     Rush views the charred remains in the glass case. Photos of
     the destroyed lab. Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene.

                               RUSH
                  I was never told how he died. It
                  was all just weird, you know, because
                  Flynn's the guy who hired me. But
                  he was strange, kept to himself, I
                  didn't know what job I was supposed
                  to be doing.
                      (to Sinclair)
                  Then you came onboard, the company
                  woke up, we had a direction. It was
                  kind of pathetic, because by the
                  time Flynn died, everybody was too
                  busy to care.

                              SINCLAIR
                  He was brilliant in his way, but
                  genius without discipline leads to
                  nothing. His reckless habits nearly
                  ruined this company... And for sure
                  got him killed.

     A last look at the charred remains of Flynn's machine.

                              MEG
                  That kind of accident can't happen
                  again. We've upgraded the system in
                  ways Flynn never could. The chips
                  didn't exist until now.

     She presses commands. Beams re-materialize the lab rat on
     the target stage. Jo-jo is as good as new.

                                MEG
                  Hey, Jo-Jo.    Have good trip?

     She puts the rat in on her shoulder, feeds it a tidbit.
     Then she scrutinizes Rush.

     Rush considers Meg, then turns to Sinclair.

                              RUSH
                  You want her to send me into
                  cyberspace to catch that jerk who
                  hacked us?

                              SINCLAIR
                  The future of this company depends
                  on it.

     Rush looks to Meg.    She offers a reassuring nod.

                              RUSH
                  You can bring me back okay?

                                MEG
                  Ask Jo-Jo.

     Lab rat is perched happily on her shoulder.

                              SINCLAIR
                  Destroy the intruder by 9AM tomorrow,
                  Rush. I know if anyone can, it's
                  you. I've had my eye on you for a
                  long time. Score this hit and I'll
                  make you my full partner in this
                  company.

     Rush is awe-struck. Ready, willing, able.        He shakes
     Sinclair's hand, sealing the deal.

                              RUSH
                  I won't let you down.   Let's do it.

     Meg removes target stage, swings a custom TARGET CHAIR in
     place. Rush lowers in place. Meg buckles him in. Last
     chance for a private word:

                              MEG
                  I promise I'll get you back safely
                  by 9AM tomorrow. But you have to

                  You're a piece of work. You dumped
                  me because you said I was too much
                  about the company's needs and not
                  enough about yours. Well here we

                  much to hurts to nominate me.

                              MEG
                  This bigger than us, Rush. Listen
                  to me. I don't know what you're
                  going to find in there, but whatever
                  it is, promise you'll follow your
                  heart and do the right thing.

     Rush stares at here, in shock.

                                RUSH
                  Oh.    So you think I have a heart?

     Meg breaks away, retreating to the controls with Sinclair.
     Rush's trails her with his eyes - he can't stop looking.

                              RUSH
                      (under his breath)
                  I promise.

     Meg initiates Quantum Digitizer sequence.

     Rush watches PULSING CHROMATIC LIGHT build down the unit's
     column, coming toward him.

     Plasma strobes CYAN/MAGENTA. Unit HUMS... Then GROANS
     WILDLY. Flashes randomize. Something's off balance -

     Meg worries.       Moves for the "abort" button.

                              DEWEY
                  It's overloading!

     Unit sparks.       Ceramic components STRESS and CRACK.

     Rush clenches his seat, terrified.

     Sinclair pulls Meg's hand from the "abort" button and slams
     his hand on "DIGITIZE".

     BEAM ARRAY scans Rush's body, reducing it to bits -

     Meg worries -

     Sinclair dives for cover -

     PLASMA BALL engulfs Quantum Digitizer.

     FINAL BITS of Rush scan away.

     Plasma ball FRIES the unit.         Breakers trip.   Power fades.

     Meg and Sinclair come up to find:

     Quantum Digitizer:       In a smoking heap.

     Target chair:       Empty.


27   EXT.   CYBERSPACE TRANSITION

     Light-speed thrill-ride, hurling into digital chaos.

     Rush's electrified body hurtles across the void, eyes filled
     with TERROR and AWE.

                                                            TRANSFORMS TO:

     Shimmering bits morph into an awesome cyberscape.

     Rush enters this bizarre world - CRASH/FLASH - stranger in a
     strange land. Data energy ZAPS off his body, interacting
     with the landscape circuitry around him. He fights it, tries
     to control it.

     Rush stands, beholds the place. Looks at his hands and arms,
     clad in circuitry. He finds he had landed outside:

     Fortress-like X-NET CENTRAL SERVER.       ALARMS SOUNDING inside.

     He turns, looks up a FIREWALL. Hundreds of X-Takk Troops
     hurry to look down. FIRING WEAPONS.

     A FIGURE comes at him, down the wall, STREAKING RED.

     BLAMMO!

     TRON lands on a plateau above Rush, gazing down.

     They face each other, equally perplexed.

     Rush is no longer human, but not quite a program either.
     Energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry.

     Tron stares, unblinking - Cyber-Ninja.

                                RUSH
                  It's YOU!    The intruder!

     Rush's body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his
     feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. Energy
     interacts with Tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of
     code.

     Code races across Rush's eyes.        Identification data.

                                RUSH
                  You are...    TRON?!?

     X-Takks hustle onto the scene.

     Tron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection.      He
     whips his disk off his back and THROWS.

     Disk SLAMS Rush in the gut, knocks him flat.

                  ARRRGHH!

     Tron recovers his disk - vanishes in an OUTBOUND DATA STREAM,

     Plexor and Mega trade a look.

                  How do we contact Sinclair?    He'll
                  explain.

                  must be a way to link him into this.

     Rush touches Plexor's command console, but his energy
     OVERLOADS the system -

     X-Takks pull Rush away.

                              MEGA
                  Zero match for a "Sinclair".

                  Assuming the existence of a world
                  beyond this, is a fatal error.

                  Okay. Sorry. I'm a program, guess
                  I got a piece of my code corrupted.
                  Whatever it is, it's given me power
                  over Tron.
                      (to X-Takks and Mega)
                  They saw me read his circuits. Can
                  any other program do that?

     Plexor looks to Mega.

                              MEGA
                  He creates alternative data channels
                  at will.

                                 PLEXOR

                  Yeah, I'm a little unstable.    But I
                  can find Tron for you.

     Plexor processes.     His eyes stream barcode data to X-Takks:

                                 PLEXOR
                  Release him.

     X-Takk Troops read Plexor's barcode command with their eyes.

     They let go of Rush.

     Plexor turns to Mega.       Issues more barcode.

                              PLEXOR
                  Interface with this one. Exploit
                  his ability. Locate the program
                  "Tron" and destroy him on sight.

                              MEGA
                  Instructions received, Plexor.

     Mega exits with Rush.       Plexor's gaze lingers on Rush.

     Ultra sleek STRAITHE vehicle glides out, accesses a shiny

     Mega at the controls.    Rush rides, beholding the lightshow
     wonder of Cyberspace.

                            RUSH
                I need to find a program called KROD.
                He's a specialist in pattern
                recognition. He snagged the last
                known position on Tron for me.

     Mega scans data, gets a fix on "KROD".

                            MEGA
                This is a waste of X-Net resources.
                You're strictly random. We will
                never find the intruder this way.

                            RUSH
                Plexor ordered us to work together.
                You can't doubt his instructions,
                right?

                            MEGA
                Of course not. But I am programmed
                to predict all possible errors. You
                contain an infinite quantity.

                            RUSH
                Meg for sure programmed you.

                            MEGA
                I have no data on "Meg".

                              RUSH
                Never mind.    I'm being random.

     Mega speeds along empty X-Net OPTIK HIGHWAY. Wide, secure,
     newly constructed. High above the tangle of chaotic, clogged
     OLD DATA ARTERIES.

                            RUSH
                X-Net is amazing. It's going to
                change everything. Unless one rogue
                program called Tron brings it down.
                Do you believe he could?

                            MEGA
                I calculated the probability.
                    (soberly)
                He could crash it all.

                            RUSH

33   INT.   X-NET SWITCHING NEXUS/HUB CITY

     Construction nearly complete.       High security.

     Mega leads Rush to secured encryption gates.         Her eyes light
     with data, the gate opens.

                              MEGA
                  The program "KROD" is over there.

     Across a bridge: An old-network HUB CITY. Like Hong Kong
     in wilder days. Jammed with Programs, colorful data, loud
     data transfer screams.

                                 RUSH
                  What a dump.

     He heads across, but Mega hesitates.

                                RUSH
                  Hey.    Interface.

     Mega grudgingly follows.       Portal closes.


34   EXT.   HUB CITY

     Electro-pop overload. Rush and Mega squeeze through crowds,
     past screaming data pipes and sizzling circuitry.

     City is dominated by mugshots of TRON:          "ENEMY OF THE FUTURE"

     Mega locates a gleaming X-NET KIOSK. A PROMOTER (KROD)
     extoles the virtues of the X-Net system:

                  But X-Net opens soon! You will travel
                  in total security!

     Crowd buzzes.       They can't wait.

                              MEGA
                  This is the one you seek?

     Rush approaches Krod. Looks like Miles Rabbish.           There's a
     bizarre moment of recognition between them.

     Rush pulls Krod aside.

                  Miles - I mean Krod, you flew the
                  search engine. You ran a trace on a

                  Well. Eh. I'd like to help you,
                  but truth is, I just got rebooted
                  from a big crash. There's nothing
                  left in my memory from before.

     He taps his head.

                  Hang on.

     Rush thinks, touches a surface. Concentrates. Circuitry
     zaps from data coming off his hands. Connections illuminate,
     data races around walls and floors.

     Programs stop what they're doing, amazed by the feat.

                  Remember, Krod? You were watching
                  this lightcycle duel, a red guy and
                  a green guy, head-to-head.

     Krod gawks at the image, but he's stumped.

                              RUSH
                  The green guy faked out the red guy,
                  but the red guy double-faked the
                  green guy.

     Bingo.

                              KROD
                  Okay! YES! And the green guy
                  splattered big time! It was awesome!
                  How could I forget that?!

     Splat happens in Rush's memory image.        All goes white.

                              RUSH
                  Where did the red guy go after that?
                  You didn't crash right away.

                              KROD
                  He escaped out this hidden exit -

     Krod's points to another screen.        "Wanted" image of Tron.

                  Right... But how did those poor

                  They stood in the center.   Held their

39   INT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET NEXUS

     Plexor oversees construction.     X-Takk Commander points to
     something in the distance.

     Beyond the horizon, the RUBY RED BEAM reaches to the heavens.

     Plexor sees it, alarmed.

     Mega turns with alarm.

                  ABORT!

     Walls THUNDER and CRASH IN -

     Rush leaps clear with his disk -

     MASSIVE ROMBALL (data reformatting orb) hurtles around the
     I/O Port, ZAPPING all it touches, de-rezzing data structures
     into neutral gray "blank matter".

     ROMBALL loops skyward.

     GIANT D-REZZ PROGRAM crashes down from above, retrieves
     ROMBALL - He's ENORMOUS, TOUGH, SINGLE-MINDED.


41   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION - SINCLAIR'S OFFICE - DAY

42   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT

     D-Rezz screams like a modem, hurls ROMBALL -

     Mega and Krod dive clear -

     ROMBALL misses them, but BLAZES DOWN two more I/O Ports.        D-
     rezz retrieves ROMBALL, bears down on Mega and Krod.

                             RUSH
                Hey! Double points if you nail me!
                Bring it on!

     D-Rezz turns his ugly sights on Rush, baited away from Mega
     and Krod.

     D-rezz flexes and ROARS, revealing an X-NET LOGO on his chest.

                              RUSH
                Stop!    End your routine!

     D-rezz corners Rush, hurls his ROMBALL - Ball fires every
     circuit in its path, bleaching away data energy.

     Rush dodges -

                              RUSH
                Cease!    Desist! We're on the same
                team!

     Mega throws her disk, plings D-rezz on the skull.      D-rezz
     turns on her -

     Rush runs, LEAPS on D-Rezz's back.      Like riding a gorilla -

     D-Rezz flips Rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty
     hand, raises his ROMBALL for the kill.

                            RUSH
                I'm X-Net too!

     Data flows from Rush's body, up D-Rezz's clamping arm.
     Radiant energy between predator and prey.

     Digits race in D-rezz's eyes. A code unlocks. He looks
     down, finally registering the X-Net markings on Rush's outfit.

     D-Rezz lets go of Rush, slumps back on his haunches.       Lowers
     his head in shame.

                            RUSH
                No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it
                so hard. We all have bad days.

     Mega and Krod cautiously approach.

                  He was carrying out his programming.
                  All I/O Ports are scheduled for de-
                  rezz.

     D-rezz hears this, happy to be understood.       (He never talks.)

                              KROD
                  Easy, big guy. No harm, no foul.

                              RUSH
                  D-Rezz, we can use a guy with your
                  raw power. You ready to be a hero
                  for X-Net?

     D-Rezz stands, clutches his ROMBALL.       Reporting for duty.

                               KROD
                  Cool. Now I've got somebody I can
                  boss around.

     D-rezz modem-growls at Krod.

                              KROD
                  Or not.

                              RUSH
                  Let's get to the game grid.

     Rush leads them up an incline.

                              MEGA
                      (grudgingly, to Rush)
                  You have a skill for manipulating
                  other programs.

                              RUSH
                  When do I get a shot at hacking your
                  code?

                              MEGA
                  Never. Our operating systems are
                  incompatible.

                              RUSH
                  You act like I've got a virus.

     They come to a spectacular vista of the OLD GAME GRID.       Low
     resolution, uncool, largely forgotten.

43   EXT.    GAME PORTAL OUTPOST

     Obsolete, abandoned computer game entry portal, guarding
     entry to the old game grid beyond. An electro-tech carnival
     zone gone dark. No life in sight... Then:

     Beam of DATA ENERGY sling-shots at ground level, solidifying
     to become:

     A slender, jumpy Program called I-BEEM. He wears the X-Net
     logo and a cracked disk on his back. He's highly unstable
     and way unplugged from the system (like one of those Japanese
     soldiers still fighting alone in the hills 10 years after
     WWII was over).

     I-Beem sees something - he PANICS, zapping away in
     characteristic streaks of airborne data. He reassembles in
     a hiding place, skittish, observing:

     Rush, Mega, Krod and D-Rezz arrive. See GIANT PILE of GAME
     VEHICLE PARTS blocking access to the grid.

     Rush picks up an old LIGHT WAND.       Krod finds one too.

                               RUSH
                  D-rezz.   Cut a path.

     D-Rezz hurls his Romball, ZAPS into VEHICLE PARTS.       A dent.

                                 KROD
                  That's good.     Keep doing it.

     D-rezz retrieves Romball for another whack -

     ZAP -    DATA ENERGY BEAM snaps in front of them, becoming I-
     Beem.    He grips his rickety disk, challenging them.

                               I-BEEM
                  Violation!   Go away!   Access denied!

                              RUSH
                  Relax, buddy -

     Mega scans I-beem.     He freaks, drops his disk, grabs for it.

                              KROD
                  Pound him to bits, D-rezz.

43   CONTINUED:

     D-Rezz raises his Romball to pulverize I-Beem.

     I-Beem freaks, ZAPS away in his data beam as Romball crashes
     down. I-Beem reforms further way, then beside them - He
     snatches his pancake disk, the zaps away again, emerging
     then high on the pile of parts.

                              RUSH
                  He's wireless.

                              KROD
                  Freaky.

                  They booted me off X-Net! I'll show
                  them! I'm doing my subroutine out
                  here! Nobody gets through this
                  portal!

     He kicks parts - avalanche fills the gap D-rezz blasted.

                              KROD
                  D-rezz, take out this blip.

     D-rezz cocks Romball. I-Beem freaks, sling-shots all over
     the place via his data beam, tossing his wobbly disk.

     Rush catches I-Beem's disk.       Holds off D-Rezz.

                             RUSH
                  Hang on. I-Beem. We're from X-Net
                  CPU. You're doing a great job out
                  here. Everybody knows it.

     Mega throws Rush a look.    I-beem comes up, grateful.

                              I-BEEM
                  They do?!

                              RUSH
                  That's right. Now, have you seen a
                  rogue Program around here? He's
                  red. Super fast. Known as "Tron".

     Data zags to Rush, forming into: I-Beem.       Wide-eyed.

                              I-BEEM
                  Right before you got here.

     Rush trades looks with Mega, Krod and D-Rezz.       Trail is hot.

                              RUSH
                  I-beem, we've got a plan to shut
                  down that red violator. You're going
                  to help us.

                              I-BEEM
                  Let me at him!

                              RUSH
                  First, you've got to let us onto the
                  game grid.

     I-Beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. He scans the four of
     them again, finally softening. He zaps to a wall near his
     giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. Beyond
     a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal:


44   EXT.   OLD GAME GRID

     Rush steps across the vast vector-graphic grid surface.

     Eerie.   Quiet.     Pure.

     Mega, I-Beem, Krod and D-rezz follow.

                              MEGA
                  This region is obsolete.

     Rush kneels, touches grid lines.    Circuits energize, as his
     energy surges in all directions.    He draws in data.

                              RUSH
                  There's bits of Tron's code all over.
                  Krod, give D-Rezz and I-beem the
                  escape coordinate Tron used on me.

     Krod's eyes flash data to I-Beem and D-rezz.      "Tr165444.018".

                               RUSH
                  That's where Tron will bail out.
                  We'll make sure he needs to. Go set
                  up the trap.
                      (to D-rezz)
                  You only get one shot at this, big
                  guy. Stop him but don't destroy
                  him, right? He's got data I need.

     D-rezz grips Romball, grunts affirmation.    He and I-beem
     head for the perimeter of the grid.

                              MEGA
                  If this is Tron's territory, he'll
                  know we're here. He'll hide.

                               RUSH
                  He can't resist a grudge match.
                  He'll take risks trying to beat me.
                  That's how we trip him up.
                      (to Krod)
                  Whip it out.

     Rush unsheathes his LIGHT WAND.

     Krod pulls out his own LIGHT WAND.

     They both look at Mega.

     She's got no light wand.

                              KROD
                  You didn't bring one?

                  Hey, not a problem -

     Krod holds his light wand forward, activates it.    LIGHT CYCLE
     up-rezzes under him. He revs it, ready to go.

     Rush activates his light wand. LIGHT CYCLE up-rezzes under

                  I upgraded my unit.

                  You are awesome, man.    I hate you.

     Mega considers. There's more on her mind she's not talking
     about. She smiles at Rush, climbs on back of his light cycle.

                               MEGA
                  Mmmm...   Hack me.

     A nod between Rush and Rush - they TAKE OFF.

     LIGHT CYCLES shoot across grid surface.

     Mega screams and clutches Rush, throwing her body against
     his, clamping her arms around him.

     Krod and Rush turn 90 degrees, rallying, passing each other,
     getting warmed up. It's familiar territory.

     Light cycles race toward each other on the same line.

     Mega holds Rush tight, eyes filling with terror.

                              MEGA
                  Resource conflict!    Fatal crash
                  imminent!

     But Krod and Rush slow their light cycles with expert skill,
     rolling safely to a halt, nose-to-nose. Directly over:

     A BIG RED DOT.      The only dot on the grid.

     Grid Center.

     Mega, Rush and Krod raise up to scan the horizon.        It's all
     clear flat grid to the horizon.

                              RUSH

                  Everything looks the same. The same.

                  The same...


45   EXT.   EDGE OF GAME GRID

     D-rezz and I-beem search grid edge, along the rocky boundary.
     I-beem zaps himself further along, finding:

     Glowing code numbers mark the end of each grid line.

     D-rezz grunts, points.      One lights up "Tr165444.018"

     They follow the line off the grid, where it leads into a
     narrow rocky pass.

                              I-BEEM
                  Yes, I see. Perfect trap. This is
                  going to be good. Climb, climb!


46   EXT.   GAME GRID / CENTER SPOT

     Rush, Mega and Krod wait on their light cycles.

                                MEGA
                  Its futile.

                                RUSH
                  Look.

     SPECK moves on the horizon, turns a corner, stays on the
     horizon. Another corner. It's a light cycle, making a huge
     box around them.

                              RUSH
                  Remember the plan, Krod. Don't bail
                  out until the last millisecond.

     Lightcycle turns toward them, coming fast.

                              RUSH
                  Hang on tight, Mega.

     Mega hugs Rush.

                                KROD
                  Mmmm.

     They SPEED AWAY.

                                          38

46   CONTINUED:

     Approaching cycle comes at 90 degree angle, turns hard, closes
     the distance.

     It's TRON.    Heartless eyes, ruthless moves.

     Rush turns quick, baiting Tron.      Tron turns to follow, coming
     alongside.

     Krod runs interference, cuts sharp in front of Tron.

     It's a high-stakes speed-chase, narrowly missing side walls
     and rock outcroppings.


47   EXT.   EDGE OF GAME GRID

     I-beem zaps onto the grid, tracks horizon dots.

                              I-BEEM
                  Here they come!

     He zaps back to the edge, signals upward. D-rezz straddles
     the rock passage above, ready to hurl his Romball.


48   EXT.   GAME GRID

     Tron takes the lead in a three-way heat.      Revs to breath-
     taking speed.

     Rush and Krod gain, coming up on either side of Tron.

     Tron looks to each opponent.      His eyes lock on Mega.

     Mega stares into Tron's cold eyes, almost like she's trying
     to signal him. But Tron returns his gaze forward, as the
     ROCKY EDGE looms closer.

                               RUSH
                  Wuss!   You call that speed!?

     Rush kicks in a hyper-burner, surging forward.      Krod does
     the same. Tron responds with more speed.

     Rush and Krod have Tron sandwiched, heading for the rock
     edge. Tron pulls ahead, aiming for the hidden crevasse.

     Mega worries.    Clings to Rush.


49   EXT.   EDGE OF GAME GRID

     D-rezz, astride the crevasse, sees light cycles speeding his
     way. He's got the Rom-ball poised to intercept Tron.

     I-beem de-rezzes into the grid, clearing the path.

     Rush and Krod taunt Tron into the trap...

     But, out of nowhere, Mega reaches to Rush's handlebars and
     turns 90 degrees too soon.

                              KROD
                  Hey, what are you - ??

     Tron sees the bail-out, knows something's wrong. He looks
     ahead, sees D-rezz astride his crevasse escape root, rom-
     ball poised in the air.

     Tron bails out 90 degrees, cutting behind Krod.       Krod turns
     twice, ending up in Tron's lane.

     To the side, Rush's light cycle screams toward solid rock,
     vibrating out of control.

     Rush grabs Mega and JUMPS OFF.       They slide on the grid,
     holding each other.

     Krod's lightcycle heads for the rock escape passage.

                               KROD
                  No!   It's ME!

     Rush and Mega slide to a halt, in time to see:

     Their light cycle SMASHES rocks, explodes in a million bits.

                              RUSH
                  WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!

                                MEGA
                  I-    I GOT SCARED!

     Krod shoots gap.      D-rezz is ready to smash him with his
     Romball.

                               I-BEEM
                  No!   It's Krod! Tron is OVER THERE!

     D-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball.

     Romball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with
     ferocious speed, DIAGONALLY across the grid.

     Romball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot.

     Romball clips rear wheel of Tron's lightcycle.       Lightcycle
     vaporizes. Tron skids and tumbles.

     I-beem zaps beside Rush and Mega.       Krod and D-rezz join them.

     Tron climbs over rocks, escaping through a TUNNEL.

                              RUSH
                  We've got him now.    Let's go!

     WHOOSH! Electro-fire Romball careens across grid, bearing
     down on them.

     Group DIVES CLEAR.

     D-rezz swings in a foot, stopping the Romball - inches short
     of mowing down Krod.

                              KROD
                  I could have done that.

     He strobes, freezes, hits the deck.


50   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL

     Stalking their prey:       Rush, Krod, I-beem and D-rezz.

                              MEGA
                  We can't go any further.

     Ahead, vast old circuitry has been "eaten through" by dull
     throbbing greenish MEMORY LEAKAGE. Paths of unaffected
     material are narrow and maze-like.

                                RUSH
                  What is it?

                              KROD
                  Don't ask, dude.

                              MEGA
                  It's a memory leak, once it starts,
                  it infects everything.

                              I-BEEM
                  Touch it and you crash forever.     We
                  cannot risk it.

                                MEGA
                  I agree.

     D-rezz grunts.

                              KROD
                  Then it's settled.

     Krod turns to head home.

                              RUSH
                  Stop. Listen to me. You might not
                  believe there's a world outside of
                  this one, but let's just say a guy
                  named Sinclair is depending on me.
                  If Tron got through here, then I can
                  too. Who's with me?

     D-rezz steps forward, then I-Beem.      Shamed, Krod joins them.
     Finally, Mega makes it unanimous.

                              RUSH
                  Good. I-beem, take D-rezz, see what's
                  up ahead. We'll guard this portal
                  until you come back.

     I-beem and D-rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission.

     Krod pulls off his disk, nervously practices boomerang throws.

                              RUSH
                  Better show me how to use mine.

                              KROD
                  No problem. It's all in the velocity-
                  vector ratio.

     Rush pulls the disk off his own back.      He throws - disk flies
     wild - he runs to retrieve it.

     Mega retreats to a side area, partially eroded by memory
     leakage. She finds the remnants of COM CIRCUITRY and stares
     data beams into its transducer.

                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

                  We interfaced with Tron.   He escaped
                  into a dark zone.


52   INT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM TUNNEL

     Around a corner, Rush comes to retrieve his disk.       He pauses
     to eavesdrop on Mega's communication:

                  He is all glitches and bad data. He
                  virtually got us de-rezzed. I
                  recommend we terminate this mission.

     Rush listens, hurt and angry.

                              PLEXOR
                  No. Proceed. If you keep Tron on
                  the run, he cannot attack X-Net.

                              MEGA
                  It's a poor allocation of resources.

                              PLEXOR
                  You have your instructions.

     Circuits go dark.    Mega turns, running smack into:

                              RUSH
                  "All glitches and bad data." What's
                  up with you? Ever since I got here,
                  you've been working against me.

                              MEGA
                  I act as Plexor programs me.

                              RUSH
                  Blah blah blah. You've got you own
                  processor. I can feel it working
                  overtime. Did Meg program you to
                  mess with me?

                              MEGA
                  I have no match for "Meg" -

                  First, you don't want to come with
                  me, then you're all over me on the
                  light cycle - so you can dump us
                  over and blow the plan. We would
                  have nailed Tron by now if it wasn't
                  for you. What's your malfunction?

                              MEGA

                  return to the main CPU and anticipate
                  Tron's next attack.

     She moves to exit past him.        He snags her arm, pulls her
     back and KISSES HER.

     Energy ZAPS between them, racing through their body circuits.

     Rush downloads the spiky sensation.        Mega remains cold and
     bewildered.

     Outside, Krod tosses his disk, moving to track as it arcs
     through the air. He notices Rush and Mega kissing. Digs it
     vicariously.

                                 KROD
                  You ram hog!

     His disk clunks him on the head.

     Mega breaks the kiss, backing off, conflicted.        Arcs of energy
     stretch between them, then snap loose.

     Eaten away by memory leaks, like swiss cheese.

     Rush, Mega, Krod follow I-beem along narrow paths of
     unaffected material.

     Krod trips, his LIGHT WAND tumbles and skates into memory
     leakage. It FRIES and de-rezzes, sucked into the molten
     silicon swamp.

                               D-REZZ
                 Akakakaka -    Agggggggg -

     Sounds like a modem, but it's a BATTLE-CRY.

     Rush comes to a point above - and cut off from - the fight.

     D-rezz advances along a narrow gantry, spinning his Romball,
     ready to hurl at:

     TRON.

     Tron flips over memory leakage, gains position and throws
     his disk -

     Disk HITS D-rezz. Plasma-ball GASH, but D-rezz is tough.
     He takes the damage, cocks his Romball -

     Rush darts down to help D-rezz. Mega, Rush hurry ahead.     I-
     beem zaps, zags and reforms, scared out of his mind.

     D-rezz hurls his Romball -

     Romball pings off two walls, comes at Tron from behind.

     Tron spins - milliseconds to spare - and flips clear.
     Retrieves his disk on the way down.

     Romball slams off a wall, heads back to D-rezz, but Tron's
     disk HITS IT, knocking it off course.

     D-rezz dives for ROMBALL - but it falls into the memory leak
     and FRIES TO BITS.

     Tron plants for a clear shot at D-rezz.

     Rush JUMPS down from above, right in front of D-rezz.

     D-rezz is twice as big as either of them.

     Tron's eyes are cold, lifeless, calculating.       Scanning his
     new opponent without success.

                              RUSH
                  You've got no data on me.

     Rush pulls his disk off his back, poised for a duel.

     Tron moves with calculation, grips his hyper-etched disk.
     Circling his prey.

     Throws again -

     BRRANGG -

     Rush DUCKS -

     Tron's disk slams D-rezz.     D-rezz tries to catch the disk,
     but he's just too slow.

     Rush throws his disk. Beginner's luck - it banks off a wall
     and nearly smacks Tron. Rush snags it on the way back, before
     it tumbles into memory leakage.

     Tron jumps up two levels.     Retrieves his disk.

                              RUSH
                  D-rezz, pull me up!

     D-rezz hoists Rush up.     Fingers grab upper deck.

     Tron jockeys for position.     Throws disk -

     Disk strikes D-rezz in the ribs.     Blast damage.

     D-rezz loses footing.

     Rush grabs upper level.

     D-rezz slips toward memory leakage.

     Rush grabs D-rezz's hand - he weighs a ton.

     Mega, Krod and I-beem can't get here to help -

     D-rezz PLUMMETS into memory leakage, zapping away in a blaze
     of glory -

                              RUSH
                  NOOOO!

     He comes to his feet, facing Tron.       Determined.

                              RUSH
                  I know who you are. Encom security
                  program Tr856 - TRON!

     Tron pauses.    Processes.

                              RUSH
                  Who is your User??

     Tron glitches at the question.

                              RUSH
                  Who programmed you?? I know your
                  encryption code. Tell me your User
                  or I shut you down.

     Tron throws his disk.

     Rush dodges. He sends waves of data energy through floor
     circuits, reaching into Tron's body.

                              RUSH
                  I can shut you down with a nine digit
                  code. WHO IS YOUR USER?? 392 -

     Tron's body animates painfully, as the first three code digits
     click into place.

     Tron FLIPS away, breaking contact with floor.        Data transfer
     stops. Tron steals away through a tunnel.

     Rush pursues.

     Krod, Mega and I-beem clamber for a way to follow.


54   INT.   OBSOLETE COMPUTER GAME ARENA

     Circular, riddled with memory leaks.

     Rush hurries to the center.       No sign of Tron.

                              RUSH
                  Tell me, Tron! Who programmed you?
                  Here's your encryption code! 3-6-2-
                  6-6-8 -

     Rush sends data coursing into floor circuits. It radiates
     up walls, across bridges... And finds TRON in hiding.

     Data races into Tron's body. Six code numbers engage; he
     glitches. He LEAPS to breaks the contact, flinging his disk -

     Tron's disk SLAMS Rush.       Rush tumbles off a ledge, dangling
     over a memory leak.

     Tron pounces in.    Snags his disk.

     Tron steps on Rush's hand.         Pain energy jolts Rush's circuits.

                                RUSH
                  ARRGGHHH!    3-6-2-6-6-8-7 -

     Rush slips, grabs a slim protrusion.         Feet zapping an inch
     from the memory leakage.

     Tron throws his disk for a final time.         It arcs wide, coming
     around directly at Rush.

     Tron leans down, gazing into Rush's eyes.

                                 RUSH
                  362668766!

     Burst of SEARING DATA surges off Rush's hands, radiating up
     circuitry, loading into Tron's body. All nine code numbers
     LOCK in.

     Tron's body seizes. He fights the data intrusion, but his
     circuits sequentially SHUT DOWN.

     Tron's airborne disk wobbles and darkens.

     Tron tumbles off the edge, plummets past Rush.

     Disk misses Rush, skates into darkness.

     Mega, Krod and I-beem hurry in and see:

     Rush, climbing to safety.

     And below: Tron's body slips into the memory leakage, zapping
     away to bits.

                                 KROD
                  You got him!


 
                                       48

     But Mega looks dreadfully worried.     She slips away...

     Krod and I-beem climb down and help Rush to his feet.

                              KROD
                  Game over, dude.

                              I-BEEM
                  You crashed him!

     Rush gazes off the precipice. Remains of Tron is consumed
     by the swamp of memory leakage.

                              RUSH
                  It's more than I wanted. Now I'll
                  never know who his User is.

                              KROD
                  We're heroes!

                              I-BEEM
                  I will be upgraded!

                              KROD
                  They'll give us a slot in the main
                  server!

                              I-BEEM
                  I will be upgraded!   I will be -

     Krod slams him, makes him stop.

                              KROD
                  Rush, now you can finish pinging
                  Mega's EPROM!

     Rush looks around.

                              RUSH
                  Where is Mega?

                              I-BEEM
                  She was just here.

                              KROD
                  Right behind me.

                              RUSH
                  MEGA??

     Rush searches. He finds Tron's disk, picks it up.     It's
     dark and lifeless, circuits gray.

                              RUSH
                  Mega...

     SOUNDS echo around them.       Coming fast.    Electro-metallic
     footsteps.

     Rush, Krod and I-beem bunch together and pivot.

     Black-clad FINITY FIGHTERS appear, blocking all exits.            Disks
     ready for attack.

     Rush double-takes on faces among them: QUANTZ, tall silent,
     hardcore (looks like real-world Phlegman) And BOOLE, rotund,
     seen it all (like real-world Kelter).

                              KROD
                  I recognize... Trouble.

                              I-BEEM
                  They're scanning us.

                               RUSH
                  I-beem, go for help.      Zap your butt
                  out of here.

     But I-beem freezes, terrified.         Fighters tighten perimeter.

     A hush.   Footsteps.      Clunk-zap...    Clunk-zap.

                              DARK FIGURE (O.S.)
                  It had to happen. But why now of
                  all times?

     Rush and Krod turn.       Fighters defer to:

     A DARK FIGURE, limping forward, one leg badly deformed by
     data corruption.

                              DARK FIGURE
                  A User shows up.

     Rush is surprised, then pleased.         Somebody finally gets it.

                              RUSH
                  Yeah, I'm a User. A superior being.
                  The first to enter this realm. And
                  you are - ?

     Figure's circuitry lights.         Finally, we see the face...

     It is FLYNN.

                                FLYNN
                  The first.

                               RUSH
                  Flynn.   How can you be here?

                              RUSH
                  Yeah, he's a lunatic!

     I-beem panics, zaps away in an energy beam. He reforms
     further along for a "breath", then zaps further away. Three
     FINITY FIGHTERS chase him.

     Rush is amazed to find him self in the presence of Encom's
     former leader.

     Flynn comes closer, recognizing Rush.

                              FLYNN
                  Rush Nortebi. I remember hiring
                  you.

     They are equally dumbfounded.

                              KROD
                  Somebody tipped these guys off about
                  us.

                              MEGA
                  Not soon enough.

     Fighters step aside, Mega enters, furious at Rush.

                              MEGA
                  You weren't supposed to beat Tron.
                  I thought for sure he'd finish you.

                                 RUSH
                  Thanks.

                              MEGA
                  You destroyed our last hope!

                              KROD
                  I detect a pattern in her behavior.

                                 RUSH
                  She's a spy.

     Mega and Rush ooze mutual contempt.    Rush turns on Flynn.

                              RUSH
                  No wonder I couldn't figure it out.
                  I assumed Tron User was on the
                  outside! If I'd known this, I would
                  blown past him and come straight for
                  you.

     Flynn yanks Tron's disk from Rush, peers over the precipice.
     Below, the last of Tron is consumed by memory leakage.

     Flynn ponders Tron's lifeless disk. He falters on his bad
     leg. Mega throws an arm around to help him stand. Melancholy
     energy courses between them.

                              MEGA
                  I failed our cause.

                              FLYNN
                  You did everything you could.

     They know each other well.

     Rush registers jealousy, but larger concerns prevail:

                              RUSH
                  Flynn never died...
                      (dawning)
                  Because your Quantum Digitizer worked.
                  That's how you got here... I know -
                  that's how I got here too.

     Flynn studies Rush, anger rising.

                              FLYNN
                  The day after I hired you, you start
                  sucking up to Sinclair. You thought
                  I didn't know. Bet he offered your
                  a partnership for this, right? You
                  have no idea the damage you've done.

                              RUSH
                  I'm only getting started. Man, you
                  were the company joke. Now I see
                  why. You melted down your lab to
                  take this little joyride. You got
                  stuck here so all you can do is wreck
                  other people's hard work.

                              FLYNN
                  Open your eyes, geek. My lab was
                  rigged. My "death" was no accident.
                  I pushed the button just in time to
                  escape... Almost in time.

     He indicates his deformed leg.     Mega, Krod and the others
     listen with awed bewilderment.     These two guys speak of a
     world unknown to them.

                              RUSH
                  You're paranoid. Who would want you
                  dead?

     Malicious grumbles from Fighters.

                  Too many of your brain cells have

     Three Fighters return from the I-beem pursuit.      Empty-handed.

                                 FIGHTER ONE
                  He got away.

     Flynn scowls at Rush. Sin number two.       Flynn slips Tron's
     dead disk in a special case.

                              FLYNN
                  Let's move. X-Net goons will soon

55   EXT.   GAME GRID

     Energy zaps across grid, forming into I-beem. He's on the

56   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM -      DEMOLISHED I/O PORTS

     I-beem de-rezzes, reforms, zaps himself toward the nearest X-
     Net OPTIK HIGHWAY.


57   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM

     Fighters thread secret buffers and gates.      Flynn carries
     Tron's disk, helped along by Mega.

     Rush and Krod are held prisoner, prodded by Quantz and Boole.

     They cross a DATA BRIDGE, drawn to the sounds of SHREIKING
     PANIC.

58   EXT.   OLD DATA METROPLEX

     Vast, retro, multi-level.   Diverse and beautiful energy flows.
     Circular architecture.

     Flynn, Mega, Rush, Krod and Fighters come to a stunning view:
     GLEAMING NEW X-NET DATA OPTIK HIGHWAY is being constructed
     right through the heart of the city.

                            FLYNN
                    (to Rush...)
                I hired Sinclair as Encom's business
                guy, so I could do the dreaming.
                Right off, he wanted to "capture the
                market" on data transmission. Had
                this plan called "X-Net", based on
                flawless efficiency, hyperlock
                security, encryption protocol
                uniformity. Blah blah. I was the
                boss, I told him to forget it. I
                knew it could go bad. But the guy
                had trouble taking no for an answer.
                He arranged for my lab to melt down.
                Sinclair took over my company and
                put X-Net on a fast-track. And here's
                where it's brought us.

     City descends into panic. X-Takk Troops evict Programs,
     seize prisoners and mercilessly hunt down resistors.

     X-Net Construction Crews build the Optik Highway with
     relentless precision, blasting aside the old city's splendid
     structures.

                            RUSH
                What are they doing??

                            FLYNN
                Beating the competition.

     X-Takk Troops storm closer - by the hundreds.

                            MEGA
                They've got us outnumbered.

                            FLYNN
                We've got to choose our battles
                wisely. This way!

     He leads them down a secret portal, into:

59   INT.   DOWNWARD PASSAGE - SECRET X-NET PROCESSOR

     Group moves along a catwalk, coming to a view of:

     X-Takks herd Captured Resistor Programs, lining them up for
     execution.

                            KROD
                Rush, why is X-Net doing this?!

     A Kid Program runs to this Captured Father Program.

                No!   Let my daddy go!

     X-Takks haul Kid Program clear, then BLAST the Captives with
     de-rezz weapons. Captives glitch, thrash and expire.

                            RUSH

60   EXT.   REAL WORLD CITY - DUSK

     Like any other day. Except a high-rise building's lights
     flicker off. A subway escalator stops. A traffic light

                  And to think, Rush - all this time,
                  you've been working 24/7, trying to

                  Tron was our late hope.

                              RUSH
                  We've got to stop this!

     X-Takks hear Rush's shouts.     An overwhelming force.

     Flynn and Mega shove Rush into a tunnel, closing the portal -

     Flynn hastens their journey.

                            MEGA
                Rush was trying to expose us!

                            FLYNN
                They didn't see us.   Keep moving!

     Mega, Boole and Quantz move along, shoving Krod and Rush.

                            RUSH
                We've got to tell people on the
                outside -

                            FLYNN
                Plexor shut down all the I/O ports.
                Only HE communicates with the outside.
                Sinclair holds all the cards.

     Flynn turns on Rush - one of Sinclair's cards.

                            FLYNN
                How did you get here?!

                            RUSH
                Megan Randall sent me.
                    (points out Mega)
                Her User. She fixed your lab and
                sent me here to take out Tron.

                            FLYNN
                Megan Randall? I remember her.
                Smart, wise beyond her years. I
                can't believe she'd fall for
                Sinclair's lies.

     He glances at Mega, then shoves Rush along.


67   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT

     Flynn, Mega, Fighters bring Rush and Krod into the clandestine
     Fighter base. Like a wartime casualty center, with corrupted
     Fighter Programs lining corridors.

                            RUSH
                What happened to them?

                Try to attack Plexor head-on, this
                is what happens. Because of you,
                there will be millions more.

                  Lock up these two. We'll hold them
                  for ransom. Or use them for target
                  practice.

     Flynn and Mega turn to go.      Boole and Quantz use PROD LANCES
     to herd Rush and Krod.

                              RUSH
                  Flynn. You think I'm Sinclair's
                  flunky, but I'm not.

     Flynn pauses.    Rush speaks low, so X-Net Captives can't hear.

                              RUSH
                  I'm sorry about Tron.

                              KROD
                  Yeah, we're - Sorry?

                              RUSH
                  We were just doing a job, we had no
                  way of knowing the truth.

                              KROD
                  No way at all.

                              RUSH
                  Flynn, I was wrong about you. You've
                  been doing the right thing in here.
                  Plexor has to be shut down. Sinclair
                  has to be exposed.

                              KROD
                  Like he said.

                              RUSH
                  Krod and I are ready to help.

                              KROD
                  We are?

     Flynn puzzles over Rush.

                              FLYNN
                  Mega, what do you read in him?

                  lying to me the whole time!

     Rush points a finger at Mega - BOLT of ATTRACTION ENERGY
     shoots off his finger, ZAPS her on the nose.

     Mega's circuits OVERLOAD, she flies back -

     Rush, startled, looks at his finger.

     Fighters muscle Rush and Krod away.

     Flynn holds Mega, anger re-ignited.

                              FLYNN
                  Mega's been risking her existence
                  for our cause, lamer. That's more

                      (to Fighters)

     Fighters toss Rush and Krod in the JAIL BLOCK with the BIG X-

                  Hey Krod...     Shut down.

     Rush peers out of his cage, watching Mega go.        She turns for
     a final scowl, then exits.

74   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT

     Flynn reviews Fighter training. Troops throw disks, battle
     in pairs, repair weapons, tweak armor circuitry.

     Flynn carries Tron's dark disk, contemplating it.       He moves
     past a line-up of his finest Fighters.

                              FLYNN
                  If X-Net is allowed to open it's the
                  beginning of the end of a free and
                  open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor
                  get away with this. Our game plan
                  has not changed. Tron was specially
                  programmed to break into X-Net and
                  shut down power supplies. We would
                  then exploit these weak points and
                  cripple the system. Tron's role was
                  essential One of you must take his
                  place.

     He holds up Tron's disk.

                              FLYNN
                  Who among you can power Tron's disk
                  and carry out his mission?

     All Fighters take a step forward.

                              FLYNN
                  It's the most dangerous job. If
                  you're not up for it, nobody's going
                  to blame you.

     All stand firm.

     Flynn lays Tron's disk in the first Fighter's hands. Fighter
     summons his will, causing the disk to glow faintly. But it
     soon goes dark again.


                                        64

74   CONTINUED:

     Next Fighter holds the disk, bearing down, animating the
     circuits... But he buckles and the disk falls dims.

     Mega worries: One-by-one, Fighters fail to power Tron's
     disk. Flynn reaches the end of the line.

     Mega puts her hands out to receive the disk.

     Flynn hesitates, then hands her Tron's disk.

     Mega clenches it, concentrating deeply. Her energy infuses
     the disk, animating its circuits stronger than anyone.

     Bur soon, her eyes strobe, her body circuits overload.

     She lets go.    Tron's disk thunks the floor, goes dark.

     Mega hardens her resolve.

                  There are other ways to crash Plexor.
                  I will return to him, he still trusts
                  me. I will get close and crash him
                  with direct contact -

                              FLYNN
                  It's futile. Plexor's personal
                  defense measures are massive.

     Other Fighters chime in, but they don't know what to do.

     A FIGHTER SENTRY dashes in.

                  Is that all you've got?

     It's a millisecond's distraction - Death Disk returns to
     Plexor's hand, but swings wide and GRAZES his ARM, leaving a
     swath of painful CORRUPTION.

                                PLEXOR
                  Raagghh!

     X-Takks hustle in with hefty NEGABYTE BLASTERS.

                                FLYNN
                  Rush!    This way!

     Flynn, Mega and Flynn dash across the bridge.

     NEGABYTE BEAMS slice walls, erasing all data in their path.
     Rush, Flynn and Mega dive into a tunnel, escaping by inches.


90   EXT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / DATA PIPE

     Rush, Mega and Flynn, pursued, rendezvous with Krod, Boole
     and Quantz.

                               BOOLE
                  This way!   Down the pipe!

     Rush helps Krod, Quantz and Boole into a data pipe.       One by
     one, they WHIRL away in the flow of chromatic data.

     Flynn and Mega have a breathless moment to consider Rush.

                              MEGA
                  He's better than I thought.

                              FLYNN
                  He's been sent for a reason.

                                 MEGA
                  What reason?

                              FLYNN
                  Don't know yet. Sometimes we have
                  to trust the bigger plan.

     Mega struggles to compute.

     Rush turns to help Flynn down the pipe. Mega assists.
     Flynn's wounded leg gives out, he slips. Rush holds him,
     but loses his balance, slides down.

                               RUSH
                  Mega!   Quick! Jump!

     But she hesitates -

     VELCRONIC BEAMS snag her from behind - pulling her back onto
     the ledge.

     Rush tumbles down the flume, glancing back to see:

     Mega, hauled away by X-Takk Troops.

                                 RUSH
                  MEGA!!!

     Fighters, Krod, Rush and Flynn surf down the data WHIRL,
     accelerating away from the hot zone.

     X-Takks jump in after them, but are all swallowed by the
     flow - gone.


91   INT.   FIGHTER HIDE-OUT / MAIN HALL

     Bashed and ruined, littered with fallen Fighters.

     Plexor nurses his injured arm, commanding the mop-up.

     X-Takks bring Mega to their leader.

                                X-TAKK 1
                  We got her!

     Mega stands defiant.

     Plexor regards her sternly. Extends his hand to her shoulder,
     cupping the back of her neck.

                              PLEXOR
                  You committed a fatal error.

     DATA ENERGY SURGES from his eyes, flushing her body circuits.
     She fights intensifying input, but soon weakens. She glitches
     and shuts down, falling into the arms of X-Takks.

                              PLEXOR
                  Their strategies and tactics lie
                  encrypted in her memory. Bring her!
                  I will hack from her what I need.


92   INT.   DATA PIPE NETWORK

     Flynn leads the way, surfing the chromatic hyper-speed flow
     with Quantz and Boole.

     Rush and Krod struggle to master the technique, rolling,
     slipping, recovering, grabbing each other.

                              RUSH
                  I got it, I got it, I got it.

     Boole surfs around them, heading into a squirrely curve.

                                KROD
                  AWWWWWWW!

     Krod swings high, out of control.     Dumps in front of Rush,
     who flips him upright.

     Rush and Krod swerve and gathers speed, shooting past Quantz,
     Boole and Flynn - pivoting to surf BACKWARDS!

                              KROD
                  I remember now! Nothing to it!

                              RUSH
                  Check it out!

     Rush flips up and surfs on his hands.       Krod attempts to match
     the move.

                                 BOOLE
                  Look out!

                                 FLYNN
                  TURN AROUND!

     Rush and Krod crane around to see:

     DATA PIPE spills into a massive DATA FLUME.

                                 RUSH & KROD
                  AHHHHHHHH!


93   EXT.   DATA FLUME

     Rush and Krod plummet into surging hot data, out of control.

     Flynn and Fighters expertly surf huge waves.


94   EXT.   DATA BUFFER SHORE

     Flynn, Boole and Quantz drag Rush and Krod from data shallows.
     Everyone's circuits are hot and overloaded.

                                KROD
                  I'm cool.    Not a problem.

     They let him go him go.       Krod glitches, collapses.

     Rush gets to his feet, head spinning.

                              RUSH
                  They took Mega.

                  How do we attack Plexor next?

     Flynn sizes up his new convert.

                              QUANTZ
                  You're with us now?

                  Do you know hard it is?   Opposing
                  the power of Plexor?

                              RUSH
                  It's like the forty-sixth level of
                  ConquerDome 6.1, while winning a
                  side game of Tetras Ultra, doing six
                  Instant messages and debugging a
                  demo.

     Boole, Quantz and Krod are confused, but Flynn gets it.

                              FLYNN
                  All at the same time.

                               RUSH
                  I'm there.   Krod too.

                               KROD
                  Say what?

     Flynn accepts a handshake from Rush.

                              FLYNN
                  We're going to need all the help we
                  can get. Boole, can we make it to
                  the dark zone from here?

                              BOOLE
                  There is one possible route.

                              FLYNN
                  We'll meet up with the code monkeys
                  and combine forces.

96    EXT.   SECRET X-NET PROCESSOR

      Hordes of Captured Programs are lined up for termination.

      They move close, holding each other.     X-Takks FIRE.    De-rezz
      beams zap them to bits.


97    INT.   REAL WORLD - NIGHT

      Computer Users react with frustration, as their programs
      crash (Users correspond in appearance to the Programs who
      just got zapped.)

      Web ads sell the virtues of X-Net.


98    INT.   REAL WORLD - FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT

      Fire sprinklers fire off for no reason. Workers rush away,
      sprayed from above. Assembly line full of partially-assembled
      video recorders get dowsed with water.


99    INT.   REAL WORLD - AIRLINER COCKPIT - NIGHT

      Pilots react:   Navigational instruments glitch and fail.


100   INT.   REAL WORLD - SINCLAIR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      X-Net sales rise higher, as TV news grows bleaker.

      Sinclair is distracted by a data file: News stories about
      the death of Flynn. The laboratory "accident".


101   EXT.   CYBERSPACE X-NET MAIN HIGHWAY - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

      Plexor. Lording over the grand-scale construction.        Sterile
      design, sleek lines, enormous capacity.

      X-Net Drone Workers assemble beams, girders, circuitry.

      Plexor's Cruiser speeds through a new, as-yet unused X-Net
      switching station. It's heavily secured. X-Takk troops

      Towering corridors. Powerful armored X-Takk Guards stand in
      pairs at every portal, corner and column.

      Plexor strides past, steps into a special GATE. Data beams

      Gate opens.

                   You programmed me to gather
                   intelligence. That's all I've ever

                   completely. When he knows the place,
                   I will know it as well.

                   None for now. But stay close.

                   What an extraordinary piece of
                   programming I have made of you. I
                   created X-Net to the same standard
                   of flawless beauty. Soon, its

      Three massive X-NET X-PORTER VEHICLES rumble by. Imprisoned
      in the rear are hundreds of Programs. Cruisers blast a path
      through mountains and speed away.

                               KROD
                   Those Programs think they're just
                   being transferred!

                               RUSH
                   Can we take out those X-Net guys?

                               FLYNN
                   Our forces are too thin. We can't
                   risk a battle that would reveal this
                   position.

      From another direction appear two Code Monkey Programs.

                   X-Net goons start patrolling all the

108   INT.   LAST FIGHTER CACHE

      Deteriorating silicon lattice.     Flynn, Rush, Krod and Fighters
      arrive to a meager encampment.

                                CODE MONK N1J
                   Greetings.

                               FLYNN
                   Hey guys. This is Rush and his main
                   man Krod. They defected from Plexor's
                   forces to fight with us.

      A buzz of hope penetrates gloom.       Nobody has defected from
      Plexor before.

                               CODE MONK N1J
                   We made progress decoding X-Net's
                   power supply encryption.

                                FLYNN
                   Excellent.   Let's see.

      In a make-shift lab, CODE MONKEYS demonstrate, working at
      mind-boggling speed, assembling a small intricate HOLOGON
      DEVICE (conical pyramid-shaped encryption key).

                               KROD
                   I've seen that somewhere.

                               RUSH
                   It's the encryption pattern on
                   Plexor's disk.

                               FLYNN
                   Good eyes. We've got Mole Programs
                   who score chunks of Plexor's personal
                   code anywhere they can find it.
                   These guys fit the pieces together.

                   We just snagged the last piece, but
                   the battle cost us big time.

                               FLYNN
                   How many of you crashed?

      Heads shake somberly.

                   Oh Geez.

      Flynn falters on his bad leg.       Quantz and Boole support him.

                               FLYNN
                   Time is running out!

      Rush approaches Code monkeys as they toil blur-speed, trying
      to fit the final code piece - a flat square. Pyramidal
      HOLOGON looks exactly like the X-Net desk toy we saw in Rush's
      cubicle.

                              KROD
                   Yow. I get tired just watching these
                   dudes.

      Rush sees:    Compilers try to fit the square inside the
      pyramid.

                               RUSH
                   Just for laughs, try putting the
                   circle on top of the pyramid.

                                CODE MONKS

                   That's incongruous.

                               RUSH
                   If I'm wrong, ding me.

                               FLYNN
                   What have we got to lose?    Try it.

      Code Monkeys place the square on top of the pyramid.

      Bingo.

      Square spins into a circle, latches and LIGHTS the entire
      Hologon lattice. Intricate 3D code patterns ANIMATES.

                   Not bad.

                               KROD
                   Good thing you didn't terminate us.

                                RUSH
                   How do we use this thing to shut
                   down Plexor?

                               FLYNN
                       (picks up hologon)
                   It's a copy of Plexor's master key.
                   We can break into any X-Net facility
                   and fry the power supply.

                               RUSH
                   But once Plexor knows we have it,
                   he'll change the code.

                                FLYNN
                   Yep.   We've got one shot.

                               RUSH
                   Then we should take out the power
                   supply to Plexor's main server.

                              GROUP
                   Yes! Take out Plexor's central

                   Hang on, guys, that's not as easy as
                   it sounds -

                               RUSH
                   I was inside the main server, I saw
                   how it's laid out.

                               KROD
                   I used to work there!   I'll recognize
                   where everything is!

                               CODE MONK N1J

110   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY OVER DARK ZONE

      Compiler Crews work at megahertz speed. OPTIK HIGHWAYS extend

      Pull wide to see dismal ground below.    Dark zone, emitting
      woeful blips of random energy.

      Pillars descend from X-Net crews above and SMASH into the
      old silicon, planting themselves deep and impervious.

      Rush stands on a vista point, aghast as X-Net construction

      Flynn removes a cover-plate from his leg, trying to hide the
      damage from Rush. Suspicious, Rush pulls the plate aside.

                                RUSH
                   Oh, man.

      Flynn's data corruption has worsened. His leg throbs with

                               FLYNN
                   Plexor programmed her to perform his
                   will. He's a control freak. I'm
                   not. I programmed her to have a
                   will of her own. Whatever she
                   decides, it's up to her.

                               RUSH
                   Sounds dangerous.

                                FLYNN
                   Sometimes you've got to trust the
                   bigger plan.

      Krod and Fighters approach.

                               FLYNN
                   Guys... Rush is right about our
                   final attack. If we've only got one
                   shot, we should go for Plexor's
                   central server. If we insert the
                   hologon key in the main power supply,
                   we can trigger a meltdown. Plexor
                   will be have his best troops standing
                   in our way.

                   Getting past them was the ultimate
                   task I programmed Tron to carry out.

      He takes up Tron's dark disk.

                               FLYNN
                   I turbo-charged him to burn hot and
                   burn fast. Who else could handle
                   the operating code in this disk?

      He extends the disk to Rush.

                               FLYNN
                   You.

                               RUSH
                   Uhhh, I don't think so.

                               BOOLE
                   It could mean the difference between
                   winning and losing.

                               KROD
                   Hey, I'll try.

      Rush holds off Krod, takes the disk.

                               RUSH
                   What do I do - ?

      Waves of Rush's DATA ENERGY surge into disk circuitry.

                               RUSH
                   Yow!

      He buckles and shakes.    Hands zapping.    Knees trembling.

                                FLYNN
                   Steady. It's all about giving as
                   much as you get. Let it become a
                   part of you.

      Rush clenches teeth, concentrates.     Grips the disk.

      Energy surges back and forth, up Rush's arms, around the
      disk. He holds tight, ready to scream -

                               KROD
                   Awesome, dude! Don't let go!

      Fighters are amazed, as TRON'S DISK POWERS UP -

      And RUSH'S body circuits DAZZLE in the ruby circuitry patterns
      of TRON.

                               FLYNN
                   Damn, look at that...     He did it.

      Rush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in
      hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing
      infinite surface variations.

      Rush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes
      harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne,
      lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance.

                                KROD & FIGHTERS
                   YES!   Excellent move, dude!

                                 RUSH
                   It feels...    Awesome.

      Rush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge.       It
      surprises him.

      He cocks his disk and THROWS.

      Disk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES
      an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high,
      shoots back toward Rush.

      Rush looks worried for a second, ready to duck -

                               FLYNN
                   Don't flinch, Rush!   It's your disk
                   now.

      Disk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly.       Throbbing
      with energy.

                               RUSH
                   Oh man, this is good.

      Rush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends
      into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the
      canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the
      wand in a nanosecond.

                                KROD
                   Awwwww!   Where can I get one of those?

      Another two vaults and a leap - Rush tosses his disk into a
      spiral, steps off it mid-air (like stairs), and lands
      perfectly - rejoining the group.

      Cheers from Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys.       Flynn
      shakes Rush's hand - energy surges between them.

111   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - MAIN HALL

      Plexor reviews a line of elite X-Takks. All are decked in
      thick battle gear, gripping an array of menacing ultra-tech
      weapons.

                               PLEXOR
                   Perfect. Any three of you could
                   crash an army of Flynn's best. But
                   I've prepare for his random acts by
                   designing massive redundancy.

      Widen to reveal:

      BATTALION of X-Takks, lined in precise rows, filling the
      vast hall. Since Adolf Hitler, no one has displayed such an
      awesome military machine.


112   INT.   PLEXOR'S INNER SANCTUM

      Mega sneaks in, alone. She pulls her disk off her back and
      raises it above her head. Data energizes around her. She
      clenches hard, trying to make the connection.

      A RUBY BEAM converges off her disk, reaching skyward.


113   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT

      Meg and Dewey work to dismantle the lab.

      Meg walks past, stops. Comes back.      Reads fresh text on a

      A frozen dog-like CYBAVOR CREATURE stands like a statue.

      Plexor nods.    X-Net Specialist activates.

      Cybavor comes alive.     Circuits RAGING.    Eyes pulsing.

      Plexor summons an X-Net Worker Drone.

                               PLEXOR
                   Install yourself over there.

      Worker Drone does as he's told.       He freezes in place.

      Cybavor leaps like a hyena, bounds the length of the hall.
      DIVES at the Worker Drone...

      And DEVOURS HIM mercilessly.

      Energy sparks fly, circuits zap, as the Cybavor digest the
      energy, GROWS LARGER, then SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE (like DNA),
      then regrows the missing halves.

      Now the Cybavor is a PAIR of nasty, snarling Cybavors.

      X-Takks file out in perfect lines, turn perfect corners,
      dispersing into the compound. Each one moves in exactly the
      same way.

      Plexor turns sharply to exit, encountering...      Mega.    Standing
      there obediently.


115   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER

      On the fortress perimeter, X-Takks stand watch at the base
      of a deep security moat.

      They turn, eyes scanning. Behind them, a LIGHT POLE extends
      into the canyon, then swings across.

      It's "tronified" Rush, using his vaulting pole to ferry
      Fighters across the moat edges.

      He returns to the far side, landing momentarily on a lone
      central pinnacle to make the distance.

      Rush vaults back to gather Krod, who's the last to cross.

                               RUSH
                   Don't take this the wrong way.

                               KROD
                   Don't drop me.

      He hugs Krod and vaults them across.    Krod clings and
      struggles, then YELPS -

      X-Takks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edges.

      On top of the pinnacle, Rush and Krod hunker.      Flynn signals
      from the far side "stay down!"

      X-Takks patrol below, pausing to gaze up.

      Atop the pinnacle, Krod's circuits energy-zap with fear.
      Rush holds him down.

      At last, X-Takks move on.

      Rush extends his light pole to the moat floor - vaults to
      the far side with Krod.

      Krod stabilizes, looks around.

                               KROD
                   Yeah, I recognize this place.    I

      Fighter team scales a narrow ledge near the BLAZING FIREWALL.

      Rush pulls his disk, holds it over his head and steps under

                   shuts down. And the more of us come
                   out of here to tell about it.

      Rush takes the hologon, stows it.

      Pumped looks between Code Monkeys, Boole and Quantz.           Krod
      trembles.

      Fighters hustle under the shadow of the portal...        Approaching

121   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER

      X-Takks stand thick, weapons pointed at the closed aperture.

      Plexor marks time.    Cybavors poise to attack.

      Mega, emotions rising, takes a step back.


122   EXT.   DARK PORTAL

      Flynn falters on his wounded leg.     Fighters steady him.

      Rush steps forward, places a hand on the semispheric aperture.
      Mechanism activates.


123   INT.   PORTAL

      Plexor tenses, eager for the slaughter.

      X-Takks cock weapons, take careful aim.


124   INT.   DARK PORTAL

      Flynn, Code Monkeys, Quantz, Boole, Krod...       Gathering near
      Rush -

      PORTAL OPENS AROUND THEM, revealing a stunning view of:

      The inside of the fortress...

      Not an X-Takk in sight.

                             KROD
                 Nothing to it.

      Rush leads group inside.


125   INT.   "EXECUTION PORTAL"

      Plexor grows impatient.     Senses trouble.

                              PLEXOR
                 OPEN IT!   OPEN FIRE!

      X-Net Specialist activates portal.     Semispheric aperture

      X-Takk Patrol.   Charging in from outside.

      No fighters in sight.

      Inside-X-Takks and outside-X-Takks take orders literally:

      They FIRE at EACH OTHER.      Many crash, zap and fizzle.

      Cybavors leap in, devouring corrupted X-Takks. The two
      Cybavors use energy "food" to bifurcate into FOUR.

                                 PLEXOR
                   CEASE FIRE!

      They do so, instantly.

      Plexor fumes.

                               PLEXOR
                   You've been tricked!

      He spins to find Mega gone.

                               PLEXOR
                   Mega has betrayed me for the last
                   time! She is with the fighters!
                   Find them! CRASH THEM ALL!


126   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER

      Mega RUNS from the scene. Around a corner, she collides
      with Rush, Flynn, Krod & Fighters. Breathless:

                                MEGA
                   Flynn!   Keep moving!    This way!

                               FLYNN
                   I'm proud of you, Mega.

                   I linked with MEG.     Users exist.
                   She instructed me.

                                 RUSH
                   Go, Meg!

      She glances over the new "tronified" Rush. Despite herself,
      she's impressed. But there's no time for talk.

                               RUSH
                   Which way to the power supply?!

      Rush leaps to a high ledge to confirm: Massive throbbing
      power supply CORE CUBE lies at the center of the fortress's
      concentric squares. High sign to Krod.

                               TRON
                   You're right! There it is!

                               KROD
                   And here they come!

      Rumble precedes:    ARMY of X-Takks, coming to get them.

                               CODE MONK J2R
                   Break out the toys!

      X-Takks are upon them, and the battle is joined.

      X-Net disks fly by the hundreds.

      Krod and Code Monkeys fire a SQRAM projectile, which opens
      mid-air into a super-wide circular magnetic field "net".

      SQRAM field sucks in X-Net disk and zaps them to ash.

      X-Takks charge.

      Rush flips down from above, throws tron-disk -

      Disk ricochets of ten X-Takks, mows them down.

      Rush retrieves his disk, lands near Krod and Fighters.

                               RUSH
                   Block this choke point, slow them
                   down. Can you guys do it?

                               QUANTZ
                   Not a problem.

      He throws his disk behind his back, takes out an approaching
      X-Net goon.

      Rush hurries away with Mega and Flynn.

      Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys are besieged by a hundred
      X-Takks.

                              KROD
                   Whoa! Retreat! That way!     Keep
                   firing! RUN! AHHH!

      Plexor enters the battle arena with his four CYBAVORS.     He
      scans keenly, then heads off another direction.

127   INT.   X-NET GANTRY / MAIN POWER SUPPLY

      Flynn hobbles, helped by Mega.     Rush leads them around a
      corner, in sight of:

      MAIN POWER SUPPLY.     Massive reactive CORE CONTAINMENT CUBE.

      Rush comes to the edge of a deep, narrow moat. Bottom is      a
      channel of ROILING, MOLTEN CHROMATIC DATA. No bridges.

                             RUSH
                 We have to get across.

      RAAAA!!!

      Six X-Takks are upon them, disks flying, NegaByte eraser
      beams swinging.

      Flynn Takes a hit in the chest.

                                FLYNN
                 ARRGGHH!

      Rush and Mega dodge, fling their disks with lethal accuracy -

      X-Takks crash and fall, tumbling into the moat abyss, flashing
      as they hit the molten bottom.


128   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER CORRIDORS

      Krod, Boole and Quantz bait a phalanx of X-Takks, Code Monkeys
      spring a DEGAUSSING CHARGE, which cuts off a column at the
      base. Column tumbles, crashing X-Takks, blocking the way.

      High fives among Krod and Fighters.

      One Small X-Takk breaks through, ZAPPING through the air,
      reforming, ZAPPING CLOSER.

      Fighters turn to blast him.

      But Krod recognizes the pattern:

                                KROD
                 Wait!     I know that dude!

      Quantz stuns an X-Takk Soldier - Code Monkeys hack his X-Net
      Armor. Armor powers down, revealing:

                                KROD
                 I-beem!

      I-beem shakes off his brainwashing.

                   us or them?

      X-Takks attack the group, including I-beem.

      I-beem zaps away, reappearing next to an X-Takk. He steals
      the X-Takk's NEGABYTE BLASTER and mows down three X-Takks,
      saving trapped Boole.

                                I-BEEM
                   With you!

      I-beem joins Fighters as they press deeper, engaging the
      next X-Takk onslaught.


129   INT.   X-NET POWER SUPPLY OUTER GANTRY - CONTINUOUS

      Rush and Mega haul Flynn along a narrow ledge.

                                FLYNN
                   There.   You can make it across!

      He points to a thin ledge on the other side, far below.

      Rush extends his Light Pole to the ledge, moves to gather
      Flynn for a vault-crossing.

                               FLYNN
                   No, take Mega! I'll stay here and
                   run interference.

                               RUSH
                   You haven't got a chance by yourself.

                               FLYNN
                   Ah, these guys are wimps.

      It's bravado: They know his odds are dismal. Flynn slumps
      into an alcove, which is only big enough for him. He pulls
      a supply of SPIKED MINI-DISKS, ready to defend himself.

                               MEGA
                   We're not leaving you.

      X-Takks attack along the ledge.

                                 FLYNN
                   GO!   NOW!

      Rush throws his arm around Mega and VAULTS across the moat,
      landing on the far side - gaining a slim foot-hold below a
      core ENTRY POINT.

      Flynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws. His mini
      disks take out X-Takks on the ledge. Their bodies tumble
      into the moat, flashing as they hit.

      Flynn spins, the wall behind him opens.       At the end of a
      square corridor stands:

      PLEXOR.   Flanked by his four snarling Cybavor beasts.

                                PLEXOR
                   Flynn. Your moment of obsolescence
                   is upon you.

      Across the moat, Rush and Mega climb to the entry point.

      Flynn plays for time, stalling Plexor so he doesn't catch
      sight of them.

                               FLYNN
                   Freedom, Plexor. It's the better
                   idea. That's why Mega chose my side.

                               PLEXOR
                   If an idea is erased from all memory
                   banks, it can be neither good nor
                   bad. When each alternative has been
                   removed, X-Net will simply BE.

      With a hand signal, he commands his Cybavors.         They raise
      up, poised to attack Flynn.

                               FLYNN
                   Crash me. Hack me. Do what you
                   want. The yearning for freedom will
                   last forever.

                               PLEXOR
                   Nice speech... USER!

      He flicks a finger.       Cybavors gallop at Flynn.

130   EXT.   MAIN POWER SUPPLY CORE - LEDGE

      Rush and Mega gain footing at the entry point.      They turn at
      the sound of DIGITAL SNARLING.

      Across the moat, a gut-wrenching sight:

      All four Cybavors pounce on Flynn, hurling him off the ledge,
      mauling him as they go down, dividing into eight - Plummeting
      toward the MOLTEN DATA far below.

      Plexor steps out of his corridor, relishing the view:      Remains
      of fallen bodies FLASH into the inferno.

                               MEGA
                 Noooooo!!!

      Rush and Mega duck inside entry point, pelted by disks.

      Before them: A vast, brilliant, energized LATTICE. Power
      surges in rings, drawing down huge columns. Every piece of
      geometry is based on perfect squares, made of mirror-finished
      rare earth elements.

      Rush pulls the HOLOGON KEY into view. Facets resonate with
      energy patterns like those in the core.

                             RUSH
                 We plug this into the control cell,

      They share a heartbeat of solidarity.      Rivalry gone.

      Rush and Mega charge the center, throwing disks, fighting

      He and Mega JUMP, nearly raked by down-flowing ENERGY RINGS.

      X-Takks fire NEGABYTE BLASTERS - but many of the beams are
      caught in the energy flow and sucked away. That's how intense
      this place is.

      X-Takk Soldier is grazed, stumbles into ENERGY COLUMN. RING
      rakes down and ZAPS him nasty - reducing him to bits, sucking
      his energy to the levels below.

      Rush and Mega encounter oncoming X-Takks - they must split
      up. They fling disks, taking out X-Takks, dodging fire -
      working their way deeper.

      Meg and Rush throw their disks simultaneously.     Both disks
      score hits, then arc to return.

      Rush and Mega catch each other's disk. They each look at
      the strange disks - it's just not the same. The do a quick
      swap and keep fighting.

132   INT.   CONTROL CELL CHAMBER

      Rush and Mega battle off three X-Takks - the way is clear.

      Rush leaps, crashes planes of silicon.     Stows his disk, pulls
      out the HOLOGON.

      Spots the control cell's key receptacle - SHAPES MATCH.

      Rush moves to insert the hologon.

      A DISK STRIKES his arm - HOLOGON flies wild.

                               PLEXOR
                   Where did you get that?!   No one
                   knows this code but me!

                               RUSH
                   Your software has the biggest flaw
                   there is, Plexor. You can't see you
                   own mistakes.

      Plexor snatches his Death-disk, corners Rush for the kill.

      Mega's disk crashes silicon, comes at Plexor - But his
      defense field repels it. He slams it aside and it's raked
      away by downward flowing energy rings.

      Rush DIVES at PLEXOR. He's like a statue. But this time
      RUSH holds him and infuses tron-energy, breaking down Plexor's
      defense field, eating into his body circuits. It's fractal
      zapping fireworks - evenly matched foes battling face-to-
      face.

                                 RUSH
                   Do it Mega!

      Mega scoops HOLOGON off floor, makes for CONTROL CELL -

      Plexor's hand shoots out, GRABS HER, stops her like iron.

      Plexor exerts his power, holds Rush and Mega by the throats
      with his two hands, backing them toward a surface ripping
      with HOT ENERGY RINGS.

      Rush and Mega struggle, an inch from death -

      ZAAAAAA -

      Plexor stops, annoyed.      Turns and sees:

      Krod, Fighters and I-beem have arrived, firing blasters at
      Plexor's SPINAL NEXUS. It hardly makes a dent, but it creates
      a fleeting opportunity for Rush -

      Rush ducks forward, SHOOTS his disk off his back, smacking
      Plexor in the throat. Mega falls clear -

      Rush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down
      his body, but he fights the effects an DOES NOT MELT DOWN.
      He step away, shakes off the damage, retrieves his disk into
      a hand.

      Mega snags the hologon -

                                 MEGA
                   RUSH!

      She tosses it to Rush, who's already airborne -

      Rush catches hologon, sails to the control unit -



                                            106

132   CONTINUED:    (2)

      Jams hologon into its receptacle.

      Plexor cocks his death disk, EYES FLASH ELECTRO-PSYCHOSIS -

      Hologon REACTS with CENTRAL CELL -

      Shockwaves RADIATE -

      Energy rings go dim, then dark -

      Silicon shatters to ash -

      X-Takks power down. X-Net armor de-rezzes, leaving innocent
      civilian Programs. They shake off the mind-control and rise
      unshackled.

      And Plexor, like all things X-Net, chatters and glitches.
      His code erodes, his bits darken, the fiber of his being
      erodes from inside.

                               MEGA
                   Now who's obsolete?

      Rush executes a final leap, extending his feet for the final
      blow, straight at Plexor - CRASH - shattering him to bits.

      Rush finally breathes.       Sees I-beem, Krod, Quantz, Boole,
      Code Monkeys.

                                  RUSH
                   Thanks guys.

                               KROD
                   I'll never let you forget it.

      Boole tosses Rush his tron-disk.


133   EXT.   CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT

      Rush, Mega, Krod, I-beem, Fighters and liberated Programs
      stow disks and step to a high vantage point.

      Before them expands a vista of cyberspace.

      Power-down of X-Net radiates in all directions, leaving
      everything else intact. Beautiful, exotic old data networks
      instantly begin to regenerate into the open space.

                                  MEGA
                   We're free.     At last we're free.

134   EXT.   X-NET GRAND OPENING CEREMONY - MORNING

      Sinclair commands the podium:

                             SINCLAIR
                 In a world exposed to increasing
                 data corruption, I hereby switch on
                 the first global network offering
                 100% guaranteed data security.
                 Flawless performance, zero downtime.
                 The world works hard, the world
                 deserves...

      He throws a switch. HUGE monitors blaze with X-Net logos
      and graphic portals. Countdown 3,2,1...

                              SINCLAIR
                 X-NET!

      CROWD CHEERS.   MEDIA BUZZES...

      X-Net instantly CRASHES.    All screens jam, glitch and DIE.

      Crowd is stunned.    Sinclair is mortified.


135   EXT.   CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT

      Krod, I-beem, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys CHEER.

      Mega embraces Rush.    Energy sizzles between them.

                             MEGA
                 I underestimated you.   Thanks.

      She presses her lips to his.    It's electric.

                             KROD
                     (to I-beem)
                 You knew she always liked him.

                             CODE MONK B3T
                 Is she pinging his EPROM?

                             CODE MONK J2R
                 I can't see from here.

      But out of triumph, a sudden concern -

      Rush's body shoots DATA ENERGY into Mega, into ground
      circuits... Lightshow overload intensifies and spreads.
      Mega backs away in pain.




                                               108

                               RUSH
                   Whoa, ouch, what?       Ahhhhh!

                               MEGA
                   Rush, what is it?

      Rush's body DRAINS AWAY into the energized circuitry.

                                   RUSH
                   Guys!   Mega!     NOOO!

      He reaches a hand to Mega.          PAIN ENERGY ZAPS her, but she
      clasps his hand anyway...

                                   KROD
                   Help him!

      Code Monkeys attempt desperate measures, but soon it's over.

      Bits of Rush dissipate into surrounding circuitry, then BEAM
      SKYWARD in blazing curtain, like a quantum aurora borealis.

      Mega is left with a handful of nothing.

                               QUANTZ
                   It's the way it should be.

                              BOOLE
                   He's going back to the place he
                   belongs.


136   EXT.   CYBERSPACE TRANSITION

      Rush's energy body hurls across cyberspace.

      Bits streak, light bends -


137   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT

      Rush materializes in the target chair.          Human flesh, real
      clothes. Same as the moment he left.

      He bolts up, realizes where he is.          Looks at his hands.
      Sees Jo-jo the rat staring at him.

      Meg and Dewey hurry over to unstrap Rush.          Meg holds his
      hands, checks the integrity of his body.

                                MEG
                   Rush.   You made it!




   
                                        109

137   CONTINUED:

                               RUSH
                   Like a bad cold, I'm always coming
                   back.

                                 VOICES
                   He made it!    Rush! You okay?!

      Rush looks around. Miles ("Krod") and a group of oddly-
      familiar Co-WORKERS. People who look just like I-beem,
      Quantz, Boole and the Code Monkeys.

                               RUSH
                       (double-takes on Meg)
                   I met a program you wrote. She's
                   just as incredibly beautiful and
                   confusing as you.

                               MEG
                   I know. Mega told me all about what
                   you did in there.

                               RUSH
                   She gave you my coordinates.     That's
                   how you uploaded me?

                                MEG
                   Yes.   Your coordinates...     and his.

      They look across the room.

      At the control console stands a MAN with his back to us.
      He's curiously examining Meg's equipment.

                               THE GUY
                   She's done an amazing job here, Rush.

      He turns.    It's FLYNN.    In the flesh.    Leg healed.

                                 RUSH
                   Flynn!

                               FLYNN
                   I told you to trust the bigger plan.

                               MEG
                   I'd come to suspect Flynn was alive,
                   inside. But I had no way to know
                   for sure.

                               FLYNN
                   You picked the right guy to send in.

                               MEG
                   Working down here, I became convinced
                   someone tried to murder Flynn. But
                   the only person I could confide in
                   was the guy I suspected most.

      Elevator opens.

      Sinclair charges in, furious.    Trailed by SECURITY MEN.

                               SINCLAIR
                   What are you people doing down here!?!
                   Get back to work! X-Net has CRASHED!
                   We'll all be ruined!

                               FLYNN
                   Speak for yourself, Sinclair.

      Sinclair wheels to see Flynn: Alive, standing in front of
      him. Trapped by the ugly truth, Sinclair turns rage on Meg.

                               SINCLAIR
                   I ordered you to destroy this
                   equipment!

      Rush gets in Sinclair's face.

                               RUSH
                   Hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty
                   work. Neither do I. Not anymore.
                   You lied to me, to all of us. You
                   want to deal with somebody? I'm the
                   guy who crashed X-Net.

      Sinclair goes for Rush. Rush delivers a solid punch.
      Sinclair grabs his bloody nose.

                               SINCLAIR
                   You're fired, everybody get out.

                               FLYNN
                   No, Sinclair. I'm back. And I'm
                   the boss again. You're fired. Not
                   only are you fired, you're going to
                   have a lot of explaining to do to
                   the SEC, the Justice Department and
                   the FBI.
                       (to SECURITY MEN)
                   Hold him until the police get here.

                               SECURITY MAN 1
                   Yes Sir, Mr. Flynn.

      SECURITY MEN haul out Sinclair.

      Flynn addresses the group.

                               FLYNN
                   X-Net is dead. But Encom lives.
                   We're going to bring this company
                   back to its place as the leader in
                   finding the next big thing. I'll
                   need to be free to do the dreaming.
                   So, effective immediately, I'm
                   appointing two bold, bright,
                   courageous people to head worldwide
                   operations.

      He presents Rush and Meg.        They're stunned.

                               FLYNN
                   You both earned it.

                                RUSH
                   Cool.

                                MEG
                   I love it.

                               RUSH
                   We'll take it.
                       (to Miles - "Krod")
                   You get a division to run.

                                MILES
                   Yes.
                       (to Phlegman)
                   Does that mean a bigger cubicle?

      Cheers all around.    Flynn approaches Rush and Meg.

                               FLYNN
                   Put on some coffee. You two are
                   going to be putting in a lot of
                   overtime together.

      Meg turns to Rush.

                               MEG
                   Do you remember how, along time ago,
                   you used to give me a professional
                   congratulatory peck on the cheek?

      Rush goes for the lips.

          EXT. VIETNAM -- DAY

          A HUEY COBRA in slow motion, crests an impossibly
          beautiful jungle ridge, flying low and straight at us.

          INSIDE THE COBRA
          A GUNNER sprays fire down at unseen anti-aircraft. All
          that can be see on the ground are whizzing TRACERS flying
          up at the chopper.

          

          

          

          
          "Tropic Thunder 4.
          The chopper skims the treetops heading toward a hot LZ...

          EXT.,, HOT LZ -- DAY

          As the Cobra comes in hard, about TWENTY INFANTRYMEN are
          emerging from the tree-line, in a chaotic fire fight with
          twice as many VC SOLDIERS.
          As the. chopper tries to land, the gunner tosses a couple
          of grenades behind the Americans, sending about ten VC
          flying. But the bulk of the platoon is getting GUNNED
          DOWN by the enemy.
          A. heavy set grunt, FATS, looking like he is in great
          pain, is'running full speed for the chopper, taking fire
          from all over.
          Fats looks a 'lot like JEFF PORTNOY, star of ."Doody For
          Dinner".
          BROOKLYN, an.18 year-old cherry from Brooklyn, is also on
          the move, towards the.chopper...Clutching his thick black
          glasses, and a. map, and triangulating coordinates, he' is
          frantically trying to call in an air strike on his radio
          backpack. A GRENADE EXPLODES ten feet away knocking him
          on his ass.
          He gets up, shaken, just in time to be BAYONETED. through
          the stomach by a VC SOLDIER...
          The VC soldier turns around just in time to be machine-
          gunned down-5y MOTOWN who has all sorts of stomizd
          shit" on his fatigues, an ace of spades in his helmet,
          along with some graffiti scrawl that reads "and God
          spoke" including cut-off sleeves that reveal his
          impressive pipes. He, is a 'bad muthaf.ucka.

          MOTOWN
          That's for Brooklyn, Muthafucka!
          Underneath the hovering chopper, OSIRIS,a black, buffed
          out Rambo-looking Sergeant, is letting loose his M-16
          with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower.
          It does.
          Fats grabs. the mortally wounded Brooklyn and slings him
          over his shoulder, Brooklyn's shirt is blown open
          revealing his entrails...in shock, he clutches his liver
          in his right hand, and is trying futilely to put it back
          in his body...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 5.
          FATS heaves Brooklyn onto the floor of the still-airborne
          chopper just as it gets low enough, and returns to
          firing. He unleashes a hailstorm of lead at the
          approaching VC...

          OSIRIS

          FATS! GET YOUR ASS ON THIS CHOPPER NOW!

          LET'S MOVE!

          4 41
          FATS ignores him and continueb firing. MOTOWN comes
          running up to the chopper...

          confirmed! This place is gonna be toast
          in about thirty seconds!
          Osiris turns on Motown, pulling his .45 in the midst of
           the mayhem. He pushes it up into Motown's neck.

          OSIRIS

          FOUR LEAF IS DEAD MEAT, SOLDIER! AND YOU

          GOT ZERO 0' HUNDRED HOURS TO GET YOUR ASS

          ON THIS CHOPPER BEFORE YOU JOIN HIM!
          Osiris, standing on the skid, motions for the chopper
          pilot to take off.

          Motown looks to Fats,:then reluctantly jumps on the
          chopper...It begins to hover...

          OSIRIS(CONT'D)

          FATS! YOU GET ON THIS BIRD NOW! YOU HEAR

          ME YOU MUTANT MOTHER--

          Sarge...
          .We PUSH IN ON BROOKLYN dramatically as he raises his
          head. Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked
          finger...

          BROOKLYN
          It's him. It's Four Leaf...
          Everyone turns to-see...
          FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN
          from the "Scorcher" trailer, . burst through the treeline,
          half limping, half crawling heroically through the
          massive firefight in SLOW MOTION.
          He is being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET...CONG SOLDIERS...
          Everyone on board seems mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and
          can't believe his eyes... nevertheless, he screams to the
          pilot. I

          OSIRIS

          GO! GO!
          Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs
          the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of
          strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might,
          preventing it from flying away.
          The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues
          his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm,
          providing weak cover for Four Leaf.
          The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about
          ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle
          with the helicopter.
          Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is
          fighting a losing battle to gain ground... He doesn't
          even have a gun...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 7.
          Osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men, then at
          Fats... a flash of anger and compassion comes over his
          face.. .
          FOUR"LEAF, Christ-like and arms extended, sinks to his
          knees, his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of
          lead...

          OSIRIS

          I HOPE YOU FAGGOTS LIKE HAMBURGER BECAUSE

          THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE

          BRINGING BACK TO THIS BIRD.. .COVER ME!
          Weak smiles flicker across the face of the men as they do
          just that... unleashing lead all around Osiris as he jumps
          out of the chopper like an Apache warrior.
          Fats drops off the runner of the chopper, shooting his
          machine gun in cool SLO MO.
          Screaming a war cry, Osiris makes a beeline for Four
          Leaf. Dancing between the raindrops, he dodges tracer
          fire ...
          Osiris finally makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf,
          cradling his head. Four Leaf's eyes are glassy, and his
          body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll.

          FOUR LEAF
          Get outta here. I'm worm food, man, you
          dig?

          OSIRIS
          (beginning to cry)
          What, and give up all that California
          pussy you been talking about? Shiiit.
          Someone's gotta show me around L.A...

          FOUR LEAF
          (cracking a bloody smile)
          Shit. . .the only way you're gonna get a
          piece of LA pussy if is you go out to the
          graveyard and dig some up...
          Osiris looks down at Four Leaf's now missing arms...

          OSIRIS
          Well ...y...you better come along and
          bring the shovel...
          He starts to choke up.

          FOUR LEAF
          I'm scared,. Sarge. 'Scared I ain't never
          gonna see another sunset.
          (long philosophical beat)
          Why does a man want to pick up sticks
          against another man... 'Stead of usin'
          them sticks. to prop a man up?
          Osiris nods, now crying like a baby... ï¿½4Id Iu I. Igft

          OSIRIS'

          DON'T YOU DIE ON ME FOUR LEAF... .THAT'S AN

          ORDER!!!

          FOUR LEAF
          (beginning to fade)
          Hold my hands... 'cause I got somethin'
          to say...
          Osiris looks down.at Four. Leaf's bloody, stringy stumps.
          There's nothing to hold...

          FOUR LEAF
          Are, you holding them?

          OSIRIS_

          (WEEPING)
          Oh, I'm holding them..

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't never been worth a. nothin' in
          this life, and it's kinda late to start
          b e i' a somethin' now. But you... you
          are my... b-b-brother.
          Four Leaf screws.up.his .face and begins to cry--except
          that he can't. He tries again... and can't.. Hescrews
          up his face grotesquely...

          FOUR LEAF
          You are my...
          WE NOW PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are actually on location
          shooting this war scene with about 50 CREW MEMBERS
          watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film
          equipment.
          Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman,
          is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and.
          more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry.
          The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS, is also getting
          uncomfortable holding Speedman's not-crying head.

          (YES, LAZARUS WAS WHITE AND IRISH IN THE SATAN'S ALLEY
          TRAILER, now he is AFRICAN AMERICAN and speaks with an
          American accent-- IT WILL BE EXPLAINED SOON!)
          The person perhaps most upset about it all is the skinny'
          young British director, DAMIEN DORFMAN. Coiled at the
          monitor and covered in bug bites and sunblock, wet towels
          around his neck, and clearly not made for jungle
          life.. .he' mouths the words "you are my brothers..'." as
          if trying to will the tears from Speedman's dry eyes.

          SPEEDMAN
          (breaking character)
          I'm sorry, can we cut, Damien?
          Damien grips his headphones in confusion, looking around
          to his cadre of assistants and ADs...
          The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to
          fight, except a few are starting to wonder what's going
          on.

          SPEEDMAN
          CUT! We gotta cut, Dorf!

          DAMIEN

          (CONFUSED)
          What? What did he say?
          (to 1st AD)
          Play it through! Still rolling!
          Now the extras have stopped fighting -- except for a few
          way far back.

          1ST AD
          Play it through! Still rolling!

          SPEEDMAN
          No! Not still rolling! Cut!
          Damien runs towards Speedman.
          Fats, who is young fat comedy gross-out star JEFF
          PORTNOY, gets up from the ground, rubbing his butt.

          PORTNOY
          OW, SHIT! I fell right on my ass bone!
          Other "dead" extras begin to hold their heads up and look
          around. Some are amputee stuntmen.

          director. Tekkies scurry around, lots of confusion. Are
          they cut, or what?
          Brooklyn,'.played by the not-famous KEVIN SANDUSKY,Ihold s
          his bloody "liver" up to hand off to someone.

          SANDUSKY:
          Mr. Dorfman? Are we cutting sir? Cause .I
          think they put w ay too much blood in my
          liver again.

          DAMIEN
          STILL ROLLING! Get down Kevin, you're
          dead!
          Sandusky immediately complies, he seems to be the only
          actor listening to the director.

          SPEEDMAN
          I'm sorry.. I can't do it, Dorff.
          Damien runs up to Speedman. They are the center of
          attention -- the whole crew watching them.

          DAMIEN
          It's good, keep going. This is a big shot
          so keep going, let it come. No arms,

          It's real, death, life, brotherhood and
          we just... let's keep it going now...

          Dorf! Seriously, I think we should cut.
          I mean, Should Osiris be crying too?
          Maybe he shouldn't cry if I'm crying...
          Lazarus abruptly drops Speedman from his arms and gets
          up, shaking his head.

          attempt to change gears with a comedy...

          Speedman'and Martin Lawrence, both with guns, are holding
          up a bank -- Speedman in drag. They yell at each other

          comedy style.

          ."Simple Jack", the story-of a mentally
          impaired farm hand who can "talk" to
          animals was a box office disaster that
          many critics called one of the worst
          movies of all time.

          story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in
          "Tropic Thunder". And,' possibly a shot â 1. -4416

          Julie sits with Speedman. With them is the real FOUR
          LEAF, a stoic, grizzled man of few words.

          SPEEDMAN
          (very serious)
          All I want is to make the real Four Leaf
          here proud. It's his story, he lived it
          and wrote it in his book. That's why
          we're here. But really, I mean, how cah
          we begin to understand what he-- what you
          --went through?
          Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for
          a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only
          two HOOKS.
          Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying
          to "get inside" him as much as possible.

          (MYSTICAL)

          SPEEDMAN
          That's great. He's like a... Buddha or
          something. Maybe I should rub his belly
          for luck!
          He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it
          funny.

          gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a
          second. Dude, I mean, 46,000 dollars for
          Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's
          miscellaneous living expenses? It sounds
          like the inmates are running the asylum.

          DAMIEN
          Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if-
          you actually came out here you would see
          that .these actors are--

          VOICE OF TODD
          (loud out of'nowhere)
          The actors didn't blow up the rainforest
          and forget to turn on the camera Damien!
          I have a lot of tolerance, but when. Lt
          comes to nature I lose it!

          I will not be called an eco-terrorist, do
          you understand that?
          Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young
          assistant comes in with a cell phone.

          11

          HOT YOUNG ASSISTANT
          Sorry.
          (whispering to Damien)
          It's Chris Michael, he says it's
          important.
          Damien, shaking now, steps out on to the balcony and
          slides the glass door shut.

          EXT. RUNDOWN BALCONY -- DAY

          Though the hotel is a shambles, the view out on to the
          bay is spectacular.

          DAMIEN
          (trying to seem calm)
          Yes, Chris!?

          EXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE

          In stark contrast to the hotel where everyone else is
          living, Speedman is in what looks like an Asian
          presidential palace overlooking the ocean.
          SPEEDMAN is standing on the deck, trying hard to hold the,
          phone with his hook hands. "Simple Jack" plays on a flat
          screen inside.

          SPEEDMAN
          Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw
          a little pep talk your way. I know today
          was rough, and you're probably mad at
          yourself for not getting the shots, but
          that's the way these movies go. We all
          boot it from time to time, and today was
          just one of those days. Happens.

          DAMIEN
          (sickly sweet)
          Yes it does. It does. Though I do think
          you have to realize Chris, that you are
          somewhat responsi--

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 24.

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh, also needed to let you know, and I.
          .know you're like wrapped up with the
          movie, but I really need that new chef
          like we talked about, you know to really 4
          get that super-ripped thing happening.
          This guy is great but all he makes are
          dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked
          out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I

          DAMIEN'
          Right. well those things... those. 4,

          4,
          things ...I'm dealing with bigger issues
          right now Chris --

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah, of course, I just know we talked
          about getting super-super-ripped for that
          starvation sequence
          Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D.

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D?
          He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the
          hooks.

          SPEEDMAN

          CUT TO:

          INT. AGENCY OFFICE -- L.A. - DAY

          RICK PECK, head of the Peck Agency, sits in his office,
          overlooking. Los Angeles. He has a headset on.

          PECK.
          Guess what I'm staring at right now?

          WE INTERCUT BETWEEN SPEEDMAN AND PECK

          SPEEDMAN
          What?

          PECK
          I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back
          of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful
          living color with the two cute cuddly
          pandas from cuteville. It's insane.

          

          

          

          

          I
          Tropic Thunder 25.
          We see Pedk is holding a Vanity Fair with an ad on the
          back: it is a picture of Speedman looking earnest,
          holding two baby PANDAS. The caption reads:

          "PANDAS...THEIR SURVIVAL IS NOT SO BLACK AND WHITE"

          PECK
          The credibility factor that the pandas
          give you is priceless, and strangely, if'
          you see this picture, what really strikes
          me is the credibility that you give them.
          I've been getting psychotic feedback all
          day. Hey did you get the basket I sent?
          WE SEE: A survival-themed gift basket in a camouflage
          backpack, There's a satellite phone, camouflage
          sunblock, etc.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah. Thanks.

          PECK
          You sad? What's wrong?

          SPEEDMAN
          No I'm fine. I've just been having a
          tough time over here. They still havn't
          got the TiVo hooked up and... I don't
          know... Lazarus is getting all this Oscar
          buzz already --

          PECK
          Is that what this is about? Crazy Kirk
          Lazarus goes and places his entire body
          in some experimental Malaysian dipping
          sauce so he can actually be black, of
          course he's gonna get buzz. Listen to
          what I am telling you. He is clinically
          mentally not right.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah but the way they talk about him. I
          mean, he played a retarded guy and won an
          Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't
          even get a nomination. I don't know, I
          mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my
          "Elf" but with Oscars. Those were your
          exact words.

          PECK
          I don't believe those were my exact words
          but let's get beyond that to the root of
          this. Remember the moment you chose to do,
          this', and I wanted you to do the ESP
          robot thing with Wolfgang Petersen? And I
          said stay home be happy and you said "no,
          Rick I need to play a real human being"
          and I said "okay" and then I said "are
          you sure?" and you said that you needed
          this-for your soul?

          SPEEDMAN
          Yes but --

          PECK
          Which I totally respected and now you're
          doing the crazy surfer three..sixty move
          on me,..which I love by the-way-- but-you
          said fuck it, I gotta do it for my soul
          And-that's why I hate you.. Because you
          were RIGHT. And you're in. the Phuc Long
          fucking Delta,. in the real mud, with-
          leeches in your hair, 20,000 mil
          es from
          Fatburger.being an actor-And, I would
          wager, forcing everyone around you to
          rise to your level. Am I right? I mean
          you are over there forcing a bunch of
          PUSSY actors to gel, straighten up and.
          become a platoon. And it hurts. Am I
          right?
          Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah. You are right.

          PECK
          Alright, that's what.I thought. Now get
          to work genius soldier. I'll handle the
          .TiVo.
          Peck hangs up abruptly.

          ON SPEEDMAN
          Speedman punches the button on his cordless and puts. it
          down. He ponders Rick's words as he gets caught up
          watching the end scene of "SIMPLE JACK" on his TV.
          He has forgotten Damien is on the other line.

          EXT. RUNDOWN BALCONY -- DAY

          Damien stands holding the phone, still on hold. Through
          the glass, we see the entire crew waiting silently behind
          him.

          SPEEDMAN ON TV (O.S.)

          Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty

          DAMIEN
          Chris? You there? Hello?
          Finally, after a few moments of listening to this, Damien
          explodes. He throws the phone on the ground and jumps up
          and down on it. He notices the crew staring at him. He
          tries to look as if that just didn't happen.
          He opens the sliding glass, and heads straight to the
          door. He continues walking through his office, out into
          the main offices. He motions for his assistant to join
          him.

          VOICE OF TODD
          Damien? This is not going to go away! I'm
          going to be on my cell all day -- I'm
          going to a funeral but I'm keeping it on.
          That's Where we're at with this!

          OUTSIDE OF DAMIEN'S OFFICE
          He walks with purpose, followed by his assistant.

          DAMIEN
          Get everyone together! We are having a
          cast meeting" tonight! No choice! Everyone
          must attend. I am putting my foot down!

          HOT YOUNG ASSISTANT
          Oh... I don't think I can do that,
          Damien. Chris is having that "End of
          First Week" party at his place tonight.

          EXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE -- NIGHT

          It is an APOCALYPSE NOW theme party. Vegas style. Tiki
          torches,, buffets. PLAYBOY PLAYMATE DANCERS circa 1967 are
          dancing on a deck in front of a banner that reads "ONE
          WEEK DOWN!". The crew and cast are partying their asses
          off.
          i n ï¿½ï¿½ i nMï¿½'al
          WAITERS, dressed like bald Marlon Brandos in full face
          camo, serve hors d'oeuvres.
          PORTNOY, not looking very sober, jumps up on the stage
          with the dancers and starts doing a striptease.

          ENTRANCE TO THE DECK
          Damien walks in, watching this scene from Caligula going
          down. He looks in a deep funk.
          Portnoy STAGE DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with
          a thud in front of Damien.

          DAMIEN,
          Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to
          talk -- as.a cast, as a platoon, right
          now.

          PORTNOY
          (sick and drunk)
          Dorfie-- did you happenito see that grip
          withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was
          supposed to meet him here. He has a-
          package of mine.
          Kevin Sandusky ("Brooklyn" from the movie) comes up to
          them, looking fresh faced and eager.

          SANDUSKY.
          Hey Mr. Dorfman. Jeff. You O.K? That was
          some hit you took today.

          PORTNOY

          (BEAT)
          Who are you?

          SANDUSKY
          I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin
          Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn?

          PORTNOY
          Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that
          grip with the bandana?

          SANDUSKY
          Uh, no. I think--
          But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug
          connection. They both watch him go.

          SANDUSKY
          Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find
          you. I know this is a party, but this
          afternoon after work I was breaking down
          my M-16, and I have to say, in the night
          watch scene, a minute and a half is a
          pretty short amount of time to assemble
          it.

          DAMIEN

          (TOUCHED)
          You actually care, don't you?

          SANDUSKY
          Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge
          opportunity. To be working with all these
          great actors, and you.

          DAMIEN
          You're the only one who auditioned.
          You're the only one who did the two week
          boot camp, Sandusky.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird.
          Wasn't the point that we were all
          supposed to bond?

          DAMIEN

          (BITTERLY)
          Yes, that was the point.
          Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it.
          We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of
          food.
          Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a
          spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS
          who is deeply uninterested.

          SPEEDMAN
          I guess I just watched some retarded
          people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time.
          with them... watching them.. Watching all
          the retarded stuff they did.

          LAZARUS
          Huh, I always found mere observation a
          little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to
          mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram
          the source of the pain. Then live it.

          SPEEDMAN
          (trying. to keep up)
          Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the
          first time in-my life..
          (searches for the word)
          Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer,
          retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth
          retarded. In a `weird way I had to
          unlearn what it was to be... .NOT
          retarded.

          LAZARUS
          Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was
          smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was
          retarded. So you can afford to play
          retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky
          tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there.
          Especially.knowing how the Academy is
          about that shit.
          Speedman is lost:

          SPEEDMAN
          About what?

          LAZARUS
          (with 'a chuckle)
          Are you serious? Everyone knows you
          don't ever go fully retarded!

          SPEEDMAN
          How do you mean?
          Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session.

          LAZARUS
          Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man.
          Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT
          retarded. He could count toothpicks,
          cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT

          Retarded? Maybe. Had braces on his legs,
          he charmed the pants bff Nixon, and won a
          ping-pong competition. Peter Sellers,
          "Being There", infantile? Yes.
          Retarded? No.
          He claps a hand on Speedman's shoulder.

          LAZARUS
          You went full retard, man. You never go 14
          full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean
          Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard.
          Went home empty handed.
          Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be
          so stupid?

          LAZARUS
          (cruelly, driving it home)
          But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could
          be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose
          the hook hands though... cripples don't
          give the Academy wood either.

          SPEEDMAN

          (DAZED)
          Oh.
          Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass
          and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately
          holding the spring,roll in his hook.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE,OF THE ROOM
          Damien paces the party. He looks more miserable and high
          strung than ever. He discovers Redykulous, surrounded by
          his posse and a CAMERA CREW.

          DAMIEN
          Redykulous... I need to talk to you.

          REDYKULOUS
          What up, money.

          DAMIEN
          (in a hushed tone, aware of
          the cameras)
          We're having a cast meeting, right now
          We need to come together as a unit --
          The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien
          uncomfortable ... Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout
          the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone.

          REDYKULOUS
          Uh-huh...
          Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i
          started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch
          style camera move...
          DAMIEN i
          Do you mind if we step away for a moment?

          REDYKULOUS
          From what?
          Damien tries to indicate the crew.

          DAMIEN
          (whispering even lower now)
          From the...uh...you know... .this area..

          REDYKUL:OUS
          Oh, I see...sure
          They take a few steps away from the bar... The entire
          camera crew follows.

          DAMIEN
          Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the
          cameras.
           you understand?. Away from
          (indicating the crew)
          them...

          REDYKULOUS
          No.

          DAMIEN
          What?

          REDYKULOUS
          No. I can't do that. If Redykulous
          steps away from the cameras then my
          .people don't get to see the real
          Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly
          Redykulous".

          DAMIEN
          Well this is about work ...my show so to.
          .speak. Do you understand?

          REDYKULOUS
          I guess. But not really. Your show and
          my show are the same thing. This is gonna
          help your show, trust me.

          My show AND the soundtrack drops the same
          time "Tropic Thunder opens. So you get
          that crossover audience everybody wants
          on your opening weekend, which will
          dictate your revenue streams all the way
          through DVD release, pay per view,
          etcetera.
          Damien thinks this over for a second. It does sort of
           make sense. He then notices the chmera crew pushing in k I , 1 '144%
          for a close up He awkwardly tries to get away from
          them...

          DAMIEN
          Excuse me, everyone! If I could have
          your attention!
          Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a
          couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together.

          DAMIEN
          Sorry to break up the party, but I just
          wanted to call your attention to a cast
          meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of
          the film depends on it!

          (UNRAVELING)
          Not to mention my entire bloody life!
          Damien in a final cry of frustration, SMASHES a bottle on
          the bar. He succeeds only in cutting his hand.

          DAMIEN

          GODFUCKITI SHIT!
          Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's
          shoulder. He steps to the fore.

          SPEEDMAN
          (slowly, deliberately)
          "When... we.'.. put... aside... our...
          differences... we see we're kind of the
          same."
          Within moments, the place settles completely.

          SPEEDMAN
          (Long beat...-then almost
          quietly.)
          "When we put aside our differences, we
          see we're kind of the same. Let's be
          friends, I know we will do great things
          together."

          That's a quote from my children's book,
          "The Boy Everybody-Was Jealous Of." I
          know it's just a book for. kids, but I
          think it applies to.making a movie as
          well. 'Course... I know a lot of the
          reason things are maybe messed up is ME.
          The guys look at each other -- maybe he's not so bad.

          SPEEDMAN
          I was looking-at it all backwards. You
          guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you,
          to help you gel, and straighten.up --
          like a PLATOON!
          A long beat.

          PORTNOY
          (drunk out of his mind)
          Hey,. Speedman! That bullshit pep'talk
          made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy!
          The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman
          looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really
          loud, and the, place gets even crazier.

          EXT. BEACH - LATER

          Damien, drunk, walks along, illuminated by the light of
          the moon. He holds' a bottle of wine, which.he chugs..In
          the distance, the party rages.

          When a herd loses its way, the shepherd
          must kill the bull that leads them
          astray..
          Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is standing
          eerily in the bushes by the sand.

          FOUR LEAF
          You don't know which way is up, do you
          private`? You couldn't find a dixie
          coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your
          prick. and showin' you the way...
          Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant.
          Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes.
          Damien's eyes widen in fear.

          A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant
          cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest
          can cleave that mountain to make the
          valley, and an army of ants can fell the
          mighty buffalo.

          DAMIEN
          (seeing the wisdom of this)
          Yes...

          FOUR LEAF
          If the lion, although king of the jungle,
          is thrown into the sea, he will
          drown... but...if...

          (long pause)

          DO YOU!?
          He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both
          hooks. '

          DAMIEN
          (near tears now)
          I want to!!! But not really!!

          (BEAT)
          Someone's an ANT? Or something???

          FOUR LEAF
          I put my story in your limp Brit hands
          and you will not fail me!!
          (long pause)
          My boys were worse pussies than these
          guys. But the shit is what made us a
          unit. A whole. You must put them in the

          SHIT.
          He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his
          cigarette...

          FOUR LEAF
          There's a place. About a hundred clicks
          from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the
          jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties.
          Nothing but triple canopy jungle and
          cockroaches the size of melons.
          Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his
          weirdness.

          And...?

          FOUR LEAF
          Rig up your documentary cameras'in that
          jungle, give me and Cody a few of those
          smoke bombs and some charges and we could
          light up the jungle so those lily-dick
          actors would think they were in the
          middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them
          thinking they're getting shot at, and
          you'll have your movie.
          Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as
          though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished
          mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis.

          FOUR LEAF
          You must put them.under your thumb the
          way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR
          control.

          DAMIEN
          I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my
          total control... finally. I could shoot
          the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty.
          Away from their pampered pussy posses and
          helpers...

          FOUR LEAF
          Yes... yes...

          DAMIEN
          Put them in the real shit. Film them
          with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR!

          .REAL EMOTION! YES! YES, FOUR LEAF, FUCK

          YES!!
          Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP
          as WE PUSH IN and...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

          A CHOPPER skimming the treetops, illuminated by a lonely
          moon...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 37.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Cody is piloting. Damien and Four Leaf are in the back
          sitting, across from Speedman, Portnoy, Redyk and Lazarus
          and Sandusky.
          We move across the faces of the actors, all in
          brainbuckets, who all look confusted and unhappy, except
          for Sandusky who seems excited.
          Speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his agent
          Rick Peck.

          PORTNOY

          (FINALLY)
          So, uh, any idea how long we'll be gone?
          Because I left most of my... vitamins
          back at the hotel.
          The other actors chime in with similar concerns,
          regarding sleeping arrangements, make up facilities,
          etc... '

          FOUR LEAF
          Save your breath, maggots!
          They all shrink back. Four Leaf's fierce posture is
          undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien
          sprawling onto hire.

          DAMIEN
          That'sâ¢right. Maggots.

          EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN

          The chopper lands in a small clearing as the sun rises
          behind a mountain.

          IN THE CHOPPER
          Damien and Four Leaf, in DI mode, hustle the "grunts" off
          the chopper.

          DAMIEN

          GO!!!
          Apparently they are not moving fast enough -- Four Leaf
          and Damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the
          ground.

          MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!
          The group, scared shitless, start falling out of the
          doors of the chopper, more like a bunch of oysters than a
          crack platoon.
          Four leaf jumps on the skid of thy chopper and motions to
          Cody, who lifts off. It kicksï¿½up a violent backwash, 0, Iq y
          forcing the guys to duck. and cover.

          FOUR LEAF
          See you in hell!
          As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts.
          trying to orient itself in their new surroundings.' The
          Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving.
          All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that
          has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of
          an old rusted outâ¢'downed chopper.
          All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who
          seems very upset.

          PORTNOY
          This is bullshit!
          Damien marches over to him, and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY in
          the face.

          CELL PHONES!
          Everyone hands over their phones.
          Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his.
          satellite phone out of the gift bag. He surreptitiously
          stows it down the front of his pants.

          Damien dumps them in a pile and finds a large boulder. HE
          smashes the phones with a draatic flair. The guys GROAN.
          Damien turns on them with a crazy gleam in his eye.

          DAMIEN
          Okay, girls... now that I have your
          attention, I will tell you fuckfaces what
          we're doing here. You are no longer
          actors in a movie. You,are grunts in a
          war. These men around you are your
          brothers.
          The guys look at each other, unhappy.

          DAMIEN
          Congratulations. You've just landed in
          "the shit". Your objective is to head
          north and liberate the village at D'ang
          Kwook Hill, at which point "Four Leaf"
          gets himself captured, at which point you
          rescue him, at which point we will
          chopper you home. We will also be
          rigging this entire valley of death with
          hidden cameras so that every glorious
          moment gets on film. And believe me it
          WILL be glorious. If it looks real,
          chances are good it probably is. You
          wanted to be actors? You wanted to
          occupy the skin of another human being?
          Get ready to occupy the skin of a
          terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded
          by death, crawling up Satan's arsehole.
          There's going to be enemy fire. Booby
          traps. Your own personal little slice of
          the 'Nam.
          The group shares a look -- "What's going on?"
          He pulls out a laminated packet.

          DAMIEN

          "Four Leaf", since you're the Captain
          here, here's the scene list and the map.
          (he throws them at him)
          Think you can handle it? From now on,
          Whatever we get on film is our movie,
          period.
          Damien pulls out a walkie-talkie.

          EXT. JUNGLE. -- A HALF MILE AWAY

          A group of about SIX ASIAN GUERILLA FIGHTERS, well armed
          and scary looking,,. notice the sound of the explosion.
          They begin talking very seriously in a foreign language.
          One of them grabs a radio:

          .
          They lock and load, heading towards the actors...

          EXT. JUNGLE -- A.HILLTOP CLEARING

          Four Leaf scans the horizon while. Cody sets up high-tech
          equipment, including monitors and cameras and detonation
          devices.

          CODY
          So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives
          us the go ahead, we'ï¿½ust their cherry
          with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha
          till they come running right at, us, then
          a good of fashioned firefight,
          maintaining our distance.
          Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle,
          looking almost lost.

          CODY
          I been meaning to tell ya the whole
          shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest
          fans. Your book was kinda my "Catcher in
          the Rye". It inspired me to become a gyro
          man.
          Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic
          stare.

          CODY
          I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I
          never was in the service, but for me
          blowing shit up in a war films is sort of
          my way of paying tribute to the real
          deal. And you sir, are the real deal.
          Nothing.

          CODY
          Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm
          you carry? Looks to me like a--

          FOUR LEAF
          (very scary)
          I don't know what it's called. I just
          know the sound it makes when it takes a
          man's life.
          Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.

          CODY
          Ok, we're ready to rock and roll.
          (to walkie-talkie)
          Damien, come in. Cameras are up,
          ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires
          and light the fires on your say so.

          WE are close on the seemingly broken.walkie talkie,.which
          has heard none of this. We PULL BACK to reveal the guys,
          staring at Damien's corpse in total shock. All except
          Speedman, who looks on with a smirk.

          PORTNOY
          I think he's like... dead.

          SPEEDMAN:
          (with a chuckle)
          Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice,
          wherever you're hiding!

          REDYKULOUS
          I don't think he's hiding.. I think he
          just died!
          Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse.
          pulls a wrist into frame.

          SANDUSKY
          He doesn't. have a pulse ...or a head.
          He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.

          SANDUSKY
          Must've been one of those Claymore mines.
          This old Jungle must.be full of them.,

          REDYKUZOUS
          You bet your ass it is. That's why a
          percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are
          helpin' solve the problem!
          Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle.
          Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the
          hell?
          Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent
          older brother.

          SPEEDMAN
          C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what
          .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of
          the Nam! He's trying to get in our
          heads!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 43.

          GUERRILLAS P.O.V -- FROM THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE
          They are right behind the treeline, watching the guys
          from about thirty feet.

          SPEEDMAN
          That whole "life and death" speech in the
          chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do
          you think all that "playing God" was
          about?
          The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief --
          except Lazarus.

          LAZARUS
          Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is
          dead!!
          Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides.

          SPEEDMAN
          Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor
          here, but, no offense, I've done a lot
          mote effects driven event films, and I
          think I can spot a prop body.

          ON THE GUERRILLAS
          The LEAD guerilla signals for all his guys to hold their
          fire and pick their targets...

          ON THE ACTORS
          Suddenly, The walkie-talkie lying on Damien's body
          crackles to life:

          CODY (ON WALKIE)
          -- I repeat, we are now go for mission!

          DAMIE--
          The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up,
          showing it to the guys. See?

          SPEEDMAN

          (SMIRKING)
          Alright, can we start the scene now? Or
          do you need a formal invitation?!
          (checking the list)
          Scene 12A, ext. Jungle. Day. Ambush.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 44.
          Speedman closes his eyes, taking a second to get into
          character. He opens them, and grabs. his gun and creeps
          towards the bushes, stealthily..

          SPEEDMAN
          (as Four Leaf)
          I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats.
          The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM
          "c'mon!" type look. Portnoy doesn't know what he means...

          SPEEDMAN
          I said, I got a baaad feeling on this
          one, Brooklyn...
          Oh! He's acting!
          Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking.
          stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie.
          Swinging his gun unpredictably.

          ON THE GUERILLAS
          They are a mere ten or fifteen feet from Sandusky on the
          other side of the. trees... they back off as. he waves his
          gun...

          BACK ON THE ACTORS'

          (-as Brooklyn)
          Me too, cap'n.

          (BEAT)
          Hey, cap?: If.I told you something,
          something kinda personal, you wouldn't
          think I was crazy, right?

          SPEEDMAN
          Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy
          Brooklyn...

          SANDUSKY
          Well,. if I told you that I, I never
          actually, well, been with a girl...you
          wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer
          .or nothin'... would you.?

          SPEEDMAN
          .Naw, man... I wouldn't think you was a
          queer.

          Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too:

          (acting really "black guy"

          SCARED)
          Sh...sh...shit ...When I get back to the
          world, I'm gonna find me the finest piece
          of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it
          till I broke its back.

          PORTNOY
          The last "mugambo" you ever tasted was in
          your momma's soup bowl. I wouldn't mind
          slurpin' on a little of that --

          SPEEDMAN
          That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you
          worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a
          fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't
          gonna let Charlie...
          Lazarus can't handle it anymore.

          LAZARUS
          What the FUCK is wrong with you people?!
          Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back.
          He addresses the treeline.

          SPEEDMAN
          Sorry Damien! Back to one... action!
          (he gets back in character)
          Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta

          LOTTA--

          LAZARUS
          Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED!
          Speedman sighs, annoyed.

          SPEEDMAN
          How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some
          of us are taking this seriously.
          Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he
          becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive
          transformation -- Everything except for his skin color
          returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick.

          LAZARUS
          (Heavy Irish)
          Jaysus! There isn't going to be any
          movie, ya gobshite!

          LAZARUS (cont'd)
          Damien is dead, Speedman. Yes,_the show
          must go on, but this is feckin' madness.

          PORTNOY
          (re: Lazarus transformation) i
          Wow. That was really cool.

          THE GUERILLAS
          Are watching this, poised to attack.

          BACK ON THE ACTORS
          Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now.

          SPEEDMAN
          Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped
          something.
          He mimes picking something , off, the ground.

          SPEEDMAN
          It's called your character. Don't worry,
          I won't tell the Academy!
          Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have
          seized the moment.
          The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for
          Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and
          debris kicks up all around him.

          SPEEDMAN
          You happy now? We're out of position for
          the effect! Am I the only one who read
          .the script?! This is the ambush!
          A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks
          of wood and shrapnel everywhere.

          SANDUSKY
          I think they're really shooting at us!

          SPEEDMAN
          What are you guys worried about? These
          guys are pros. The unions would tear
          them a new ass-if any of us got hurt.
          The actors stay down, looking scared.

          SPEEDMAN
          Come on, you guys! Let's use this!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 47.
          No one follows Speedman's lead., Fine, he'll go it alone.
          Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and
          doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment
          of absurd action style maneuvers throughout.
          Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and
          join him. Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what
          the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen
          enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES.

          ON THE GUERRILLAS
          Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of
          the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their
          screams, they drop back...

          GUERILLA LEADER
          
          The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up
          RPGs...

          EXT. JUNGLE - HILLTOP CLEARING

          Four Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear
          the firefight, but, Cody can't.

          FOUR LEAF
          Hear that?
          Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.

          CODY
          What? I still can't get Damien on the
          radio. I bet he forgot how to use the
          Walkie again. What do you say we get a
          little... pro-active?
          Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.

          BACK ON THE ACTORS
          Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to
          blow them to kingdom come with RPGs.
          But before the guerillas have a chance--

          

          

          

          

          I
          t' Tropic Thunder 48.

          ON CODY
          He pushes down the plunger...

          ON THE GUERILLAS

          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!!
          Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is
          going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the
          shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat.

          EXT. JUNGLE HILLTOP CLEARING

          Cody and Four Leaf watch Cody's handiwork with
          binoculars. A smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle.

          CODY
          Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!.
          Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring
          straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine
          guns pointed straight at them.

          CODY
          Oh shit.

          FOUR LEAF
          Oh yeah.
          And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of
          consciousness...

          EXT. JUNGLE -- THE ACTORS

          Speedman motions for everyone to "cease fire".

          SPEEDMAN

          (PUMPED)
          Aaaaand... CUT! Jesus!. Alright! That's
          the trailer 'right there!

          REDYKULOUS
          That was some sick shit! I wasn't even
          thinking bout the camera!
          The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all
          around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the
          jungle, sensing that someone was out there.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 49.

          SANDUSKY'
          So what do we do now?
          Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it.

          SPEEDMAN
          Damien said to head north. I'm guessing
          they've got more of these "battles" and
          Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way.
          (into it)
          Alright, let's hump-our shit to D'ang
          Kwook! Let's didi double time! We got a
          lot of clicks to cover!
          Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of
          jungle. After a beat, he reappears, looking a little
          lost.

          SANDUSKY
          Uh...Sir, isn't it that way?
          Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances
          down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up
          now.

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh yeah. Thanks, uh...

          SANDUSKY
          (can't believe it)
          Kevin. Kevin Sandusky.

          SPEEDMAN
          Right. Okay, To D'ang Kwook! Lets do-it-
          to-it!
          Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly,
          brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING

          It is a large, secret heroin processing facility,
          surrounded by barbed wire fencing. It is in a clearing
          in the jungle, by a small river.
          There's a GUARD TOWER overlooking a main gate, which
          leads into a big open courtyard area. The main structure
          is a low, concrete military-looking building.
          It's all populated with tough-looking, well-armed
          badasses.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 50.
          CODY AND FOUR LEAF, both hog-tied and unconscious, are
          marched through the courtyard, and into a building.

          INT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - COMMAND CENTER

          We are behind the back of the person who is in charge. In
          front of him, we see workers busily manufacturing tar
          heroin, in a sweatshop like atmosphere.
          A cadre of guerilla fighters domes in, sweaty and tired.
          The Lieutenant steps to the fore -- this is BYONG. He's
          badly shaken.

          BYONG
          
          The Unseen Leader shakes. his head.

          .

          EXT. BAMBOO FOREST -- DAY

          The actors are slogging along, through a tall thicket of
          bamboo. They look exhausted -- except for Speedman, who
          always manages to look like.a.movie star.

          PORTNOY
          So... we're just supposed to keep
          walking?

          SPEEDMAN
          We'll see some action soon enough. And
          try to stay in character. We're on
          camera..

          PORTNOY
          What do you mean "soon"?

          

          

          

          

          ,I
          Tropic Thunder 51.

          SPEEDMAN
          Whenever Damien decides it's time, I
          guess.

          PORTNOY
          When's that?

          SPEEDMAN
          I don't know. That's the whole point.
          Damien wants us tired and confused.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, well I'm definitely qualifying for
          those objectives.
          Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break. Lazarus
          notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.

          SPEEDMAN
          Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break,
          but be on the lookout for anything.
          Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break
          or not.
          Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled.
          Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take
          a leak. Lazarus then watches him go.
          Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears
          something rustle next to him.

          LAZARUS (O.S.)
          Psst. Hey.
          Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close
          to him.

          LAZARUS
          Speedman is watching. I don't have much
          time. I don't really need to piss. I
          need to talk to you. You went to the
          boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read
          that map?

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah...

          LAZARUS
          Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That
          hoor's melt really thinks this is a
          movie. And he's got the lot of ya
          convinced.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 52.

          SANDUSKY
          You saying you don'tithink they're
          filming us?

          I

          LAZARUS
          Of course not! It's only a matter of
          time before he walks us into more mines
          or more of whoever the hell was shootin',
          at us. That muppet's going to get us all
          killed. I need to convince everyone.to
          turn around, but I .can't do it without
          the map. You're the only one who can
          read it. Can I count on you?

          SANDUSKY
          Well, yeah, I.guess. But

          LAZARUS
          Good man, Good man.
          Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing,
          shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group.
          Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to?
          Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee
          again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see
          Speedman, right next to him.

          SPEEDMAN
          I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't
          need to pee. I need to talk to you.
          Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat
          and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create
          a red pee.stream.

          SPEEDMAN
          Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and.
          he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all
          of us. The men respect you, because you
          went to boot camp and rehearsal.
          (patting his shoulder)
          And you're pretty handy with that map. I
          need you on my side, Kyle.

          SANDUSKY

          If you stick with the program, I'm gonna
          talk to some of the Dreamworks
          brass... there'll probably be a Teen
          Choice award in it for you. You have

          Well, I --

          SPEEDMAN
          Good man. Good man.
          Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.

          EXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - LATER

          The guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown
          path. Speedman machetes through the overgrowth.

          SPEEDMAN
          If we stay on this trajectory we should
          be reaching the village any minute now.
          At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating
          from Portnoy.

          SPEEDMAN
          Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead
          of us...

          PORTNOY

          (SICK)
          No... its just that I don't feel so hot...
          I left my medication at the hotel.

          REDYKULOUS
          (to himself, snickering)
          Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those
          "meds" for my own self.
          Lazarus moves up to Speedman.

          LAZARUS
          Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a
          village don't you think we would have hit
          it by now?

          SPEEDMAN
          Quit your carping, we're right where
          we're supposed to be!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 54.
          WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of
          frame...
          We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW

          MOVING RIVER.

          LAZARUS
          .(laughing)
          Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that
          map?
          S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yes! There is! Its just a little more'
          down to the... lefty-down part from the:
          village.
          (checking the scene list)
          Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat
          Raid at the end of the second act.

          LAZARUS
          I don't see a "Sampan" boat!

          SPEEDMAN
          Any second now one should come by.
          Alright men, into the water!
          Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water.
          They all hold their rifles above their heads.

          LAZARUS I
          - L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We
          need to quit faffin' about and turn.
          around NOW! And...
          Lazarus grabs Sandusky.

          LAZARUS
          Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you,
          Sandusky?
          Kevin is caught, not sure what to d

          SPEEDMAN
          Wait! First of all...
          Now Speedman grabs him.

          SPEEDMAN
          Kelvin believes in this movie. And,
          second, need I remind you,. I am your
          superior officer.

          LAZARUS
          No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves,
          a pretty shite one.
          The actors react -- Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels'
          himself.

          SPEEDMAN
          THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only
          chance!

          PORTNOY
          Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until
          they send help! Or maybe try to get back
          to the hotel.

          SPEEDMAN
          Help from where! Need I remind you that
          Damien's orders were to --
          (right at Lazarus)
          --stay in character.
          (to the guys)
          Now, I already have an international box
          office presence, but for some of you, I'm
          guessing you might not want to screw this
          movie up!
          This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can't
          believe it.

          SPEEDMAN
          .okay...C'mon, boys! This way. Let's go
          get those Viet Congs!
          Lazarus throws down his gun. He's had it.

          LAZARUS
          Jay-sus Fuck! It's Viet Cona! Not Viet
          Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey,
          if you're so sure of yourself, why don't
          you let Kelvin have a look at the map?!
          Kevin doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't want to get
          in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough
          guy.

          SPEEDMAN
          Be my guest.
          Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a
          long beat...

          We've been going the wrong way. 'We were
          supposed to be doing this:
          Sandusky traces his finger along the correct route -- a

          Oh, man, this is not' cool, this is not
          cool at all.
          Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky.

          SPEEDMAN
          I can't believe you people!. You're
          pussing out on me? We are supposed to be
          a unit!

          LAZARUS
          No one is "pussing out." They just
          prefer not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can
          you get'us back to the landing zone
          without the map?

          SANDUSKY
          It might be tricky, but maybe.

          LAZARUS
          Okay, which is it, gentlemen? Playin' war
          with Mister Box Office? Or staying
          alive? 

          SPEEDMAN
          Unbelievable!. Are you guys really gonna
          abandon this movie?
          A long tense. beat -- finally, Sandusky walks towards
          Lazarus. Everyone follows him.
          Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his
          head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle
          with both hands over his head.

          finish the movie alone!
          (turns to Lazarus, under his

          BREATH)
          And when I give my acceptance speech,
          I'll be sure to thank you, Lazarus, for
          staying out of that scene. And come Oscar
          night, we'll see who feels a little "full
          retard"!
          He reaches the other side of the river.

          SANDUSKY
          Chris, You have no idea where you're
          going!

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah, I do!

          I'm going to "EX'S. JUNGLE. DUSK. FOUR
          LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE". And, I can
          shoot it alone.
          They'watch him trudge into the foliage.
          U2'S "BULLET THE BLUE SKY" comes up as the men watch
          Speedman disappear...

          We slowly push in on a lone figure silhouetted against
          the purple sky, trudging along the top of a trail to
          nowhere.

          CLOSER
          Speedman walks through the scary jungle, exhausted. He is
          tired, lonely and hungry. The jungle is making all sorts
          of terrifying noises. Finally he stops and regards the
          treeline.

          Why do you think that-is?

          REDYKULOUS
          "Why"?! I dunno...maybe because they had
          one good part for a black man in this
          movie and they gave it to a white guy.

          LAZARUS
          Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're
          mad because I can act "black" better than

          Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly
          avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw.
          Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.

          SANDUSKY
          Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's
          not enough we have people shooting at us!
          Now we have to kill each other?! Let's
          pull it together! This place is full of

          memory recall our director being blown
          up by onel?
          That shut them up.

          LAZARUS
          Sandusky is right... we could all learn a
          little from his common sense approach.
          From now on we walk Indian style,
          footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you
          take first position.
          He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and
          pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look.

          Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a
          tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He
          then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents
          into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule.
          He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A
          rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and
          begins to stalk his prey.
          Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of.
          fur...
          Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness,

          FOUR LEAF
          Pull it together private! Shut your trap
          before you get us killed! You understand
          me , lilydick? !
          Cody backs off, still scared.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER

          Speedman is in a windowless hut, his feet and hands tied
          to a chair.
          There are security cameras in the corners of the room,
          which Speedman continually plays to.
          Byong stands across from him, watching him calmly.

          A

          BYONG
          What were you doing in our poppy fields?

          SPEEDMAN

          (CONFUSED)
          Poppy fields?

          BYONG
          Who sent you here?

          SPEEDMAN

          ("ACTING")
          Corporal Four Leaf Tayback...Serial
          number 694529987.

          

          

          

          
          'Tropic Thunder 64.

          BYONG

          (CALMLY)
          Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing.
          a little easier?

          SPEEDMAN
          You bastard.

          BYONG
          What? just thought you might like.
          some...

          SPEEDMAN
          Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh.
          yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM!
          He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into
          the back wall.
          Beat.

          SPEEDMAN
          (under his breath)
          You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. BAMBOO CAGE --.DAY

          A pissed off Byong and a couple of guards throw Speedman
          into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge
          of-a marsh.
          He looks around, impressed with the production design. He
          looks up,.sees another security camera observing him. He
          turns it on.

          SPEEDMAN
          May God protect you from the mighty arm
          of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My
          men will seek you out and mete. out a
          cruel justice!-
          Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. RICE PADDY -- DAY

          Looking up we see a circle of faces. Our guys, looking
          down on something awful.. . .that thing is:

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 65.
          PORTNOY, delirious and groaningt

          SANDUSKY
          I think he's dead.
          A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy.

          REDYKULOUS
          No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled

          44M
          like that all night.

          LAZARUS
          What's wrong with him?

          PORTNOY

          (LYING)
          Nothing! Probably just the beginning
          stages of some ... . kinda...jungle fever.
          More bad noises.

          PORTNOY
          If we can work out some rig to carry mï¿½? I
          think it might subside in a little bit...
          No one touches him.

          LAZARUS
          Alright. Sandusky?
          Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious?

          SANDUSKY
          What?

          LAZARUS
          You and Redykulous are gonna have to
          carry Portnoy. God help you.
          He marches off.

          SANDUSKY
          God help me?

          REDYKULOUS
          God help him that bitch ever find his
          blackface minstrel show ass alone with me
          in the real world.
          Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up
          Portnoy on a make shift stretcher.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 66.

          EXT. HILLTOP

          Our guys are humping, with Fats in the makeshift
          stretcher.
          They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous
          spots something.
          ''I , I n n4ï¿½N11

          REDYKULOUS
          Look!
          From behind, Sandusky grabs him and forces him to the
          ground.

          SANDUSKY
          SHH! Everybody down!
          The guys hit the dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them.
          He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene.

          I

          BINOCULAR POV
          It is the Flaming Dragon compound...

          ON THE GUYS

          " LAZARUS
          Fook me! I knew it!

          -SANDUSKY
          Knew what?

          LAZARUS
          "EXT. P.O.W. PRISON CAMP -- DAY"! Oranges
          and Lemons,,, the bells of St. Clements.
          Speedman was right. We 'are shooting the
          movie.
          Sandusky grabs the binoculars and starts'looking...

          LAZARUS
          (to himself),
          How could I be so stupid.

          SANDUSKY
          I don't think so... . looks to me like some
          sort of heroin processing plant. Look at
          the cooking vats, and the guards.
          Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 67.

          LAZARUS
          How do you know all,this?

          SANDUSKY
          It was a long trip. I read the in-flight
          magazine. We're in the Golden Triangle,
          the biggest drug producer in the world.
          Uh-oh.

          BINOCULAR POV
          It is SPEEDMAN, who is being dipped in and out of the
          water in his bamboo cage, while a bunch of guards stand
          around and laugh. Whenever he comes up for air, he is

          YELLING:

          SPEEDMAN

          CUT!1
          (into the water, then out)

          CUT1!

          BACK TO 'SCENE

          LAZARUS
          What do you see?

          SANDUSKY
          It doesn't look good.
          Lazarus grabs the binoculars.

          LAZARUS
          Sweet Mother of Jaysus.
          Suddenly: GUNFIRE ERUPTS ALL AROUND!
          A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running at
          them, firing automatic weapons...
          The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the
          hill. Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his
          stretcher for dear life...
          In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill.. .when
          suddenly WHUMP! He falls into a PIT!

          PORTNOY

          HELP! GUYS! WAIT!
          REDYKULOUS stops and turns around and runs back to him,
          heroically pulling him out. BUT...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 68.
          There is more fire coming all around. He gives up,
          reverses tactics, and starts KICKING PORTNOY IN THE
          CHEST, trying to KICK HIM INTO THE HOLE !

          11

          PORTNOY
          Ow! Fuck Dude! What the fuck?!
          He screams in pain! Finally, WHUMP!! He disappears
          into the'hole. REDYKULOUS whistles for the guys to join
          him, and they all pile into the hole.

          IN, THE HOLE
          Totally black... . they huddle, trying to muffle their
          heavy breathing...

          ABOVE. THE HOLE
          The guerillas all frantically look around for the guys.
          No sign of them. One of them signals for them to keep
          moving.

          HOLE
          Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area. Sandusky
          lights a match. Portnoy is weeping in pain.

          SANDUSKY
          Must be one of those underground tunnels.
          The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f
          must have found one of the entrances,:.
          Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.

          PORTNOY
          My ass...I think I took one in the ass...

          SANDUSKY
          Lemme see...
          Sandusky rolls him.over, and off camera, helps him remove
          his pants... All the guys recoil in horror.

          REDYKULOUS

          AWW JEEESUS MAN!

          SANDUSKY
          How did it get infected so fast?
          More ad libs of disgust...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 69.

          SANDUSKY'
          Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell,
          but I have to take my finger and see how
          deep the slug is, and if I can dig it
          out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his
          hand...
          Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera.

          I

          PORTNOY
          Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it
          out! That's not the bullet hole. The
          bullet hole is over here!
          It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at
          the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust.

          SANDUSKY
          OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're
          gonna be fine.

          EXT. BAMBOO CAGE -- DAY

          Speedman is exhausted, slumped in his cage. He is covered
          in a few leeches. Byong appears with his usual cadre of
          guards. He nods, and they grab Speedman, and drag him
          out of the cage.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON HQ - COURTYARD

          Byong leads Speedman to the center of the courtyard. A
          HUSH falls over the soldiers.
          They begin to part, as someone very important is
          arriving.
          Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY,
          no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer.
          He smokes a cigar. This is TRAN.
          He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in
          a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off,
          revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a
          flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a
          rat. He holds a stick.

          SPEEDMAN

          (WARILY)
          Uhhh..I don't think I got the new
          pages...

          Tran points across the courtyard where...
          A"4 Iv I. InM y
          CODY AND FOUR LEAF ARE MARCHED OUT. Cody looks scared out.
          of his mind. Speedman takes this in.
          Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out
          of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran gets out his own stick
          and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN...

          TRAN

          DO YOU WANT THEM TO DIE? DO YOU WANT THEM

          TO DIE!!

          SPEEDMAN
          No! Puh-Puh-pulease don't h-h-h-hurt
          them... I
          Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He
          signals.for the guards to stop beating the others. A long
          beat.

          TRAN
          Say that. again.,

          SPEEDMAN
          Please don't hurt them?I

          TRAN
          No...like you did before!
          Silence.

          TRAN

          SAY IT!
          He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils.

          SPEEDMAN
          Puh-puh-puhlease don't h-h-hurt them?
          A hush falls over the crowd. Tran'seyes widen.

          INT. TRAN'S QUARTERS -- DAY

          Speedman is now seated in a comfortable, ornate chair,
          though his feet and hands are still bound. Tran and
          Byong and a few cohorts, stand across from him,
          whispering.

          TRAN'S ENTOURAGE

          SPEEDMAN
          What? You.. You saw Simple Jack?

          TRAN
          We love the tale of this man, Simple
          Jack.
          Tran snaps his fingers, and an assistant shows Speedman a
          battered VHS BOX OF SIMPLE JACK. Speedman looks lovingly
          at it.

          TRAN
          We do not have many luxury here. Simple
          Jack is the only movie we possess. We
          have watched it many, many times. How is
          the word? Genius?
          Speedman smiles big. They smile back at him. It's a
          small world after all.

          BODYGUARD
          (broken English)
          You should have got Oscar.

          SPEEDMAN

          No, I mean it is great to.be nominated,..
          if you are, or that's what I hear.
          Whatever. It's a popularity contest.

          TRAN
          No. We will hold.you,for ransom.--.much

          He pulls out a cell phone.

          TRAM
          Is it possible to.have picture?

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh, sure, absolutely.
          Speedman tries to throw an arm around Tran, a guard grabs
          the arm., and twists it back. Speedman shrieks in pain.

          TRAN
          You mustn't touch me.
          The guard snaps the picture.

          ABODYGUARD
          That came out really good.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- NIGHT

          The entire camp is assembled. Guards lead Speedman onto a
          platform; behind Tran.

          SPEEDMAN

          TRAN
          Yes. Begin.

          SPEEDMAN
          Hey, I know you're big fans and that's

          GREAT--
          Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt.
          Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers.

          SPEEDMAN

          OW!!
          Tran stands over him, screaming into his face:

          EXT. HOLE -- DUSK

          Sand}asky slowly lifts his head out, surveying the
          territory. It looks clear. He drops back down.

          INT. HOLE -- DUSK

          The actors look miserable. Portnoy-looks.like his face is
          going to fall off

          SANDUSKY
          It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I
          say we stay in here till it's dark.

          REDYKULOUS
          I can't believe this is how it ends for
          Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum
          recording artist., Shit.

          PORTNOY
          (shivering and wheezing)
          I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not
          gonna make.it...

          SANDUSKY
          Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're
          out'here. They'll be looking for us.
          Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And
          no one else knows but us.

          LAZARUS
          That's right. So here's the plan.
          Everyone leans forward expectantly.

          LAZARUS
          We sneak out of here, make our way back
          to the hotel and once we're safe, we
          alert the government of Speedman's
          situation.

          REDYKULOUS
          Sounds good.

          SANDUSKY
          Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just
          gonna leave him here?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 75.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, and I don't wanna spend another
          minute getting the full on smell'o vision
          in this hole with his stinky ass.
          Everyone agrees. They start packing up. Sandusky looks
          horrified.
          SANDUSKY Au II4
          WAIT! Look, I don't think I've met a more
          wildly self involved human than Speedman,
          but you're just gonna leave him here? I
          mean, come on. He's a person, guys.
          These drug lords are killers. I mean,
          they eat their enemies. We leave him
          alone now, he doesn't have a chance in
          hell.

          LAZARUS,
          That tosser is in there because of his
          own stupidity. As far as I'm concerned,
          he brought it on himself.

          REDYKULOUS
          Besides, how could we possibly rescue
          him? Get real, Sandusky, we don't know
          what the fuck we doing out here.

          SANDUSKY
          We've gotten this far. Look, we're making
          a movie about one of the greatest rescues
          ever. It's a true story,, right? I mean,
          those guys weren't superheroes! They
          were just put in extra-ordinary
          circumstances, and they rose to the
          occasion.

          PORTNOY
          Yeah, but they were trained soldiers.
          They knew how to take care of themselves.

          SANDUSKY
          And we don't? They believed they could do
          it. They believed in each other. Look,
          I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

          (BEAT)
          I mean, some of us might not come back.

          REDYKULOUS
          You mean, like, not on the same flight?
          Sandusky just looks at them. They know that is not what
          he meant.

          SANDUSKY
          Jeff -- I know this is really hard for
          you,.â¢but you're gonna have to kick some
          time, and it might as well be now.
          (he turns to Lazarus)
          Kirk, I've always admired you as an
          actor. But as a person, I have to say,
          not that impressive.' You got a.few
          Oscars. Got any balls?
          Lazarus takes this in.

          SANDUSKY
          Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good
          game, but how's it gonna feel when you're
          sipping Cristalle with your homies.in the
          hot tub back in.Cali knowing you left.a
          man to die back here? You gonna rhyme
          about that? ,
          There is a long beat.

          REDYKULOUS
          Shit. I only wish they was filming this
          for my show. I'm in.
          He looks to LazaruS.,Lazarus takes a long dramatic pause..
          Then...

          LAZARUS
          (with resolve)
          We could fooster about for donkey's
          years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and
          nix that mentaller.
          The guys look at each other. What did that mean?

          (he hits a button)
          Chris? What is this craziness?

          SPEEDMAN (V.0.)
          Hi, Rick. It's Chris--

          INT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - COMMAND CENTER

          Byong presses pause on a tape recorder he's holding up to
          Chris's satellite phone. Tran watches, very serious.

          RICK (O.S.)
          Chris?

          WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM

          BYON G
          Yes, that was Chris. But you will not
          speak with him again. And do not bother
          trying to trace this call.

          RICK
          What's going on? Who is this?

          BYONG
          We are Flaming Dragon. Speedman is with
          us now.
          There is a long silence as Rick processes this. Then he
          nods slowly.

          RICK
          Oh. Really. Well I never heard of your
          little agency. But if you wanna poach my
          client? Lemme tell you something. His
          career's been in a death spiral since
          Simple Jack, so why don't you all go fuck
          yourselves! Oh, and I bet he hasn't even
          told you about the whole panda thing! He
          killed a panda! And next time you're at
          a cocktail party with Paris Hilton, or at
          Kate Mantellini's choking down some egg
          whites with Ron Howard, DON'T LET THAT
          SLIP, because chances are, I ALREADY DID!
          Rick slams the phone down.

          He's right, man, that ain't right.
          Messin' with a man's brain.

          We gotta get him outta there...

          EXT. HILLTOP -- NIGHT -- LATER

          The guys have set up a camp, with.a small fire. Everyone
          watches as Sandusky diagrams a plan in the dirt.

          SANDUSKY'
          Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's
          where Speedman was. It looks like they
          move him at night, cause he's not here
          now. Unfortunately we have no idea what
          the layout of that place is.

          SANDUSKY (cont'd)
          But Speedman does. If we can get in
          there, and find him, maybe he can help us
          sneak him out.

          PORTNOY
          (sweating and in pain)
          I got an idea.
          Everyone turns to Portnoy.

          11 N 0 6 III4"

          PORTNOY
          It might be a little crazy, but...

          REDYKULOUS
          Crazy is better than nothin'.

          SANDUSKY
          What is it?

          PORTNOY
          (intermittent pain noises)
          Back in '98, I did a low budget titty
          comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp". Anyway,
          me and the campers from the uncool camp
          had to break into the rich girls' camp.
          So we did it by building a catapult.
          They shot us over the wall and we
          parachuted down.
          The guys all look at each other... then finally:

          LAZARUS
          That's the stupidest idea I've ever
          heard.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say
          we wait till just before dawn and sneak
          over the fence. Take our chances. You
          guys ok with that?
          The group nods in approval.

          SANDUSKY
          Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and
          Redyk are on first watch.
          (to Lazarus)
          I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll
          switch.
          They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely
          freaked out.

          SANDUSKY
          Yes you are.

          PORTNOY
          Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious.
          Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I
          scream, or however much-I plead, you.must
          not untie me. I will be cunning, I will
          be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil
          works this way. I will say, do, and
          excrete many regrettable things. But.no
          matter what.. .you must leave me alone.
          Beat..

          SANDUSKY
          Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him
          up. We'll get you through it.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON. COMPOUND -- NIGHT

          Speedman has now been moved back to the cage. He is doing
          a "late show" for a crowd of toothless old women. A
          bodyguard plays a supporting female role, he wears a mop
          for a wig.

          Speedman bows, exhausted and exhilarated. The old women
          .politely applaud. A new group forms in front of his cage.
          Speedman stands. He sighs, and begins the movie over

          GOTTA--
          Four Leaf suddenly puts his hook hand right up to Cody's
          neck. Cody instinctively blocks it with his hand.

          FOUR LEAF
          I gotta what? Take on the whole compound

          holds on to his hooks... he holds on until... HE PULLS

          PORTNOY (O.S.)
          Ohh...phew...

          REDYKULOUS
          I know-impossible huh. That's what I
          say sometimes, but its true. Talk abort
          living a loveless life. At least you
          have someone who loves you. I don't even
          have that.

          OH MY GOD. MY SKIN IS A MILLION PIECES OF

          SHATTERED GLASS RUBBING AGAINST AN OPEN

          WOUND!

          REDYKULOUS
          When I think of the nights, alone in my
          penthouse, when I've longed for the
          gentle touch of another dude, to feel his
          skin against mine, or his sweet breath on
          my face.

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          SANDUSKY
          All this from the same guy who

          (LOUD VOMITING)

          Yeah, well, let me let you in on a big

          Most of the time, when I'm writing about
          ho's in my songs, 'I really mean Niggaz.
          Creatively, that's the only way I can
          cope.

          SANDUSKY
          So what! You're gay! You're also a great
          artist and-businessman ... why not rap
          about that?

          and fragrances go south? It's all such a
          lie.
          Now he begins to cry .a. little. Sandusky embraces him.

          SANDUSKY.
          Shhh...shhh... .shhh..shhh..shhh... .That's
          it...let it out.

          Redykulous pulls back, and collects himself.

          REDYKULOUS
          Aww shit... (sniff sniff) I can't. believe
          it's possibly the last day of my life,
          and I'm not even gonna be able to let my

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- NIGHT

          Cody, still awkwardly holding the hooks, is yelling at
          Four Leaf.

          CODY
          So all of "Tropic Thunder" is bullshit?

          FOUR LEAF
          No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it
          happened!

          CODY
          Are you even a VET!?

          FOUR LEAF
          YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not
          exactly. I served honorably in what they
          called the "forced service". Sanitation
          Detail at the United States Pentagon.

          CODY
          So you were some two bit criminal who got
          caught and sentenced to clean toilets at
          the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN!

          FOUR LEAF
          God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a
          fuckup, sure, but one day as I was
          cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big-
          wig, I came across a file headed for the
          shredder marked top secret. It was Four
          Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family.
          Nothing. Killed in Action. They were
          gonna bury the whole thing. Total black
          op.

          CODY
          So you decided to take his identity?

          FOUR LEAF
          NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story
          And I gave the American people a hero!
          Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but
          if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody
          woulda ever known who he was! See what
          I'm sayin'?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 88.

          CODY
          And you cashed in!

          FOUR LEAF
          I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy
          had a story worth-telling, and nobody
          woulda ever known!
          Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost.

          FOUR LEAF
          I'm sorry, man.. I'm responsible: for this
          .whole mess.

          EXT. JUNGLE -- PRE-DAWN

          PORTNOY wakes up, still tied to. the tree, looking like
          shit. But realizes something-that makes him ecstatic:

          PORTNOY
          I'm clean! I'M CLEAN!!!!!
          He struggles to his feet, doing a celebratory dance. He
          immediately gets nauseous again and heaves.

          The text below reads:

          Rick frowns at the fax. His Hot Assistant comes in.

          Rick, you better check your email.
          He punches up his email. He opens a video attachment. We

          SEE:

          ON RICK'S COMPUTER
          A bad quality video of Speedman sitting in the
          interrogation room.

          BYONG(V.O.)
          Mr. Rick Peck. So far you have refused
          to give us the respect we asked for.

          Byong SCREAMS at Speedman, who cowers. Even Rick
          flinches.

           SERIES OF SHOTS as the guerillas ready for an attack...

          EXT. CAMPSITE -- PRE-DAWN

          The guys are suiting up for combat. They apply burnt cork
          to their faces for camouflage.

          SANDUSKY
          This is it. You know what you need to
          do.' Tropic Thunder on three, two, one...

          GUYS

          TROPIC THUNDER!
          They make their way down the hill.

          EXT. FENCE LINE -- PRE-DAWN

           They reach the fence. The coast looks clear and they each
          scamper over...
           Finally, it's PORTNOY'S turn. He's clearly too heavy.
           The fence groans under'his weight. He launches himself --
          and...
          THWANG!!! Slams painfully into the razor wire of the
          fence.
          GUARDS hear the noise. They raise their weapons and
          listen.. They see nothing in the pre-dawn darkness...
          The actors run to the wall and clumsily pull PORTNOY
          down, just in time.
          Everyone's inside the perimeter... they quickly make their
          way along the fence line to the entrance of the main
          building, ducking away to avoid a LONE GUARD.

          INT. MAIN BUILDING

          Sandusky makes a series of hand gestures, indicating for
          them to'split up and search for Speedman. A beat. The
          guys all shrug, not understanding. Sandusky repeats the
          hand gestures. Finally he has to speak.
          i 1, 11 11^ï¿½%

          SANDUSKY I 4I4
          (in a loud whisper, also
          signalling what.he's saying)
          FAN OUT! 'GO ROOM BY ROOM ! IF YOU SEE, nci 16,
          SPEEDMAN, give the signal!
          We follow PORTNOY, working his wayldown a hall. He peaks
          around a half opened door...

          A DARKENED ROOM
          .PORTNOY turns on his flashlight to reveal he is in fact
          in... HEROIN HEAVEN! Wall to wall packets, ready,for
          shipment.. PORTNOY is paralyzed. He spots a box with the
          words "For U.S.A., 100% pure, dilute before ingesting".
          His mouth LITERALLY waters, and'a drop. of .spittle oozes
          from his bottom lip. He doesn't know what to do. He
          gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box.
          marked "pure". It's like holding two grenades...

          HALLWAY
          Sandusky moves silently toward a door. He kicks it'open
          to reveal...

          SPEEDMAN
          Shackled to the floor. Delirious, he sits bolt upright.

          SPEEDMAN
          You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy.

          SANDUSKY
          Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll
          be right back!
          Sandusky runs off to get the guys.

          HALLWAY
          Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of
          his eyes, signalling that he's got "eyes",on Speedman.
          They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops
          them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for "Where is
          Portnoy?", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy.
          No one knbws what he is doing.

          REDYKULOUS

          (FRUSTRATED)
          Where is Portnoy?!

          SANDUSKY
          Shhh!
          A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be
          PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it.
          Redykulous kicks it in.

          HEROIN HEAVEN
          The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags,
          crying.

          REDYKULOUS
          What are you doing, man!

          SANDUSKY
          Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani

          PORTNOY
          I don't care! It doesn't matter what I
          do! I'll always be a screw-up! No one
          will ever respect me...

          REDYKULOUS
          That's not true! Listen, back in the
          day, I used to think I couldn't produce a
          record simply because...

          SANDUSKY
          .he's gay.
          Uh-oh. That's not what Redykulous was about to say. Beat.

          REDYKULOUS
          Actually I was going to say poor.

          SANDUSKY
          Sorry...

          Listen.. .Don't be crazy Portnoy --you're
          not a fuck up. You'make millions of
          people laugh!

          PORTNOY
          You said my farts made them laugh! Leave
          me ALONE!!

          REDYKULOUS.,
           That ain't true Portnoy! Lotta people be
          fartin' and not be gettin' 20 large a pop
          for it!

          OUTSIDE THE DOOR
          .TWO GUARDS hear the noises inside, head. in to check it
          out.

          HEROIN ROOM
          The guys hear the guards enter the far side of the room.
          They can't see the guys through the.shelves packed with
          heroin packets.

          SANDUSKY
          Damnit! We need to go!

          PORTNOY
          No, I can't do it.
          (-l-ooking-in the-pac-ket )
          I need it! I need it!! This'is all I
          deserve.

          REDYKULOUS
          Come on, man...
          And.the guards emerge. around a corner! They jab their
          rifles.at:the guys and SCREAM AT THEM TO PUT THEIR HANDS

          UP!
          The guys all slowly raise their hands...
          Then, in a moment of craziness, PORTNOY CHARGES THE

          GUARDS, PIE-ING THEM IN THE FACE WITH THE HEROIN PACKETS.

          PORTNOY

          LAUGH AT THAT!! LAUGH AT THAT BASTARD!!
          The guards let off a BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE as Portnoy
          grinds it into their noses...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 95.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          They hear the fire. Four Leaf runs to the window. Through
          it he sees the commotion...

          CODY
          What?

          FOUR LEAF
          Something's happening! Get me the hooks!

          HEROIN ROOM
          Portnoy watches as the white faced guards fall to their
          knees, choking and groggy. After a beat, they collapse.

          PORTNOY
          Let's move! We got about sixteen hours
          before they wake up!
          They run out.

          SPEEDMAN'S CELL
          The guys run in. Redykulous breaks the lock off
          Speedman's ankle with his rifle butt. Sandusky keeps
          watch by the door.,

          REDYKULOUS,
          C'mon! We're busting you out!

          SPEEDMAN
          Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack. Some folks
          call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack.

          REDYKULOUS
          What's wrong with him?

          SANDUSKY
          I think he thinks he's Simple Jack. Like
          from the movie?

          LAZARUS'
          Shite. I was afraid of this. The same
          thing happened to me when I played Neil
          Armstrong in "Moonshot". They found me in
          an alley in Burbank re-entering the
          Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator
          box.

          REDYKULOUS
          I heard that movie was good.

          SANDUSKY
          Can you fix him?!

          LAZARUS
          I'll try.
          Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to
          look at him.

          LAZARUS
          .You're Chris Michael Speedman!

          SPEEDMAN
          Ah 1-1-likes pie.

          LAZARUS
          You're the greatest star in the world!
          There's a flicker of intelligence in Speedman's eyes. It
          passes.

          INT. CODYAND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          Four Leaf wedges one of the hooks in the. door jamb, and
          Cody does the same with the other. In one fell swoop,
          :they bust. the door off its hinges.

          E-X-T . DE-T-EN-T-ION-HU-T----DAWN-
          They emerge into the chaos. IT IS DAYLIGHT NOW. A GUARD
          runs by, Four Leaf uses the hook to trip him up. Cody
          knocks him out and grabs his machine gun. He tosses the
          guard's pistol to Four Leaf.

          CODY
          By the way, what's your name anyway?

          FOUR LEAF
          Marvin Kaminsky.

          CODY
          you ever been in this jungle?

          FOUR LEAF
          Nope. First time outta the states
          actually.
          He shoots off a round and they run for cover.

          INT. SPEEDMAN'S CELL -- CONTINUOUS

          Lazarus is right in Speedman's face. He seems to be
          getting clearer...

          LAZARUS
          The world needs you! It` needs its stars!
          You make people forget how awful and 1ï¿½ I Ii I. 1 ,14M
          depressing their lives are! People love
          your work! And... I love your work, too.
          Speedman is quiet.

          SPEEDMAN I
          Uhhhh-uh-I'm... Spah-speeedman?

          LAZARUS
          Simple Jack was magnificent!

          SANDUSKY
          Is it working?

          LAZARUS
          JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re-
          programming a VCR!!
          (back to Speedman)
          You really committed yourself. And for
          that you DESERVED AN OSCAR!
          Speedman registers this.

          LAZARUS

          (FRUSTRATED)

          C'MON CHRIS! DAMMIT! YOU MUST KNOW WHO

          YOU ARE!
          Lazarus's own words make him stop and think.

          LAZARUS
          (almost to himself)
          You know who you are... . you do Chris.
          Long beat.

          LAZARUS
          Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do
          this. How can I convince a man he is who
          we know he is, when I can't even convince
          myself of the same thing.
          He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.

          That's right! We're.not what we're
          called, or who we pretend to be. We are

          Lazarus looks to Redykulous.

          They all'turn to see...SPEEDMAN. The million-dollar smile
          is back!

          SPEEDMAN
          Now let's get the hell outta here!
          Speedman leads the men to the door. Sandusky tosses
          Speedman'a machine gun.

          SPEEDMAN
          Thanks Kevin.

          SANDUSKY
          My name...you remembered my name. You
          gotta show us the way outta here Chris.

          SPEEDMAN
          Follow me.
          This time they do...

          HALLWAY
          The guys run toward the opening to the courtyard,
          Speedman leading the way...

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS

           They huddle close to the wall, unseen, surveying the
          situation: about 20 GUARDS on full alert... a JEEP about
          30 feet away... beyond that, A HELIPAD with the
          compound's chopper, maybe 200 yards in the distance...

          SPEEDMAN
          That's their supply chopper.

          SANDUSKY
          If we could create a diversion, we could
          get to that jeep and drive it right over
          there...

          PORTNOY
          Anybody here know how to fly a
          helicopter? Cause that would come in,
          handy too.

          SPEEDMAN
          You want a diversion? I'll give you a
          diversion. Is this baby loaded?
          He holds up the machine gun...

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah, but...
          And with'that, Speedman runs out in to the courtyard,..
          the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a CRAZY WAR'

          WHOOP...
          A BUNCH OF GUARDS turns to,see.him... he does a-SUPER
          MACHO TUCK AND ROLL, landing perfectly and EMPTYING HIS

          CARTRIDGE ON. THE GUARDS...

          SANDUSKY
          (to.himself)
          .they're blanks...
          There is a long moment of silence as the guards just
          stare at Speedman. He seems a. bit surprised that. they are
          not dead,. as do the guards themselves. They cock their
          weapons, about to shoot him when.,..
          A HAIL OF-BULLET FIRE-erupts-behind-the-gu-ards... They
          turn...WE REVEAL CODY AND FOUR LEAF BEHIND THEM, THEIR

          GUNS FIRING INTO THE AIR!!

          SANDUSKY
          Let's move!
          The.guys jump into the jeep, Sandusky at the wheel, and
          'gun it..

          SANDUSKY
          Chris, come.on!
          Speedman jumps. into the jeep as it passes by. They are
          speeding toward the helipad.

          SPEEDMAN WATCHES FOUR LEAF AND CODY, WHO CONTINUE

          SHOOTING AT THE GUARDS...

          SPEEDMAN
          Four Leaf! Effects guy! Come on!!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 101.
          But they can't break away, they-are trying to run toward
          the jeep but are under too much fire...

          SPEEDMAN

          WE GOTTA GET THEM, GO AROUND!!
          Sandusky swings the wheel hard. . .the jeep careens back
          toward the firefight...they come in hard, and SKID TO A

          STOP NEXT TO FOUR LEAF AND CQDY..1.
          Cody jumps in the jeep, but FOUR LEAF DOESN'T...

          SANDUSKY
          Get in the Jeep!

          FOUR LEAF
          You go... I got real bullets! I'll cover
          you.. It's the only way you'll make it!

          CODY
          Marvin, you gotta --

          FOUR LEAF
          Just go!!
          Sandusky looks at Speedman... they both know he's right.
          They go... leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still firing...
          The jeep speeds up to the helipad... the guys jump out.
          Just as the last guy is out...

          BOOM! A HUGE BLAST FLIPS THE JEEP INTO THE AIR...
          Across the courtyard is TRAN... who just fired an RPG at
          our guys!
          The guys are freaked and shaken, but start to get in the
          chopper... Sandusky pushes Cody in...

          A

          SANDUSKY
          Start the chopper now Cody!
          Cody nods, getting his bearings... and hitting the
          ignition...the BLADES SLOWLY HUM TO LIFE, BEGINNING TO
          TURN... Portnoy grabs Cody's gun and hangs by the runner,
          shooting towards approaching guards...

          WHAT WE SEE NEXT SHOULD PLAY OUT VERY MUCH THE SAME AS

          THE OPENING OF THE MOVIE:
          Tran is reloading his RPG...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 102.
          REDYK and LAZARUS GET. IN, and SPEEDMAN grabs a live
          machine gun off the ground and fires toward TRAN and his
          men.

          LAZARUS

          WE GOTTA GO NOW!! LET'S MOVE!!

          CODY

          BUT FOUR LEAF --

          LAZARUS

          WE'RE. ALL DEAD MEAT IF WE DON'T.LIFT OFF

          NOW!! DO IT CODY!!
          Cody reluctantly pulls up the throttle. The chopper.
          begins to LIFT OFF...

          SPEEDMAN.

          FOUR LEAF IS STILL OUT THERE!

          LAZARUS

          WE GOTTA GO! PORTNOY GET YER ASS IN THIS

          CHOPPER!!

          PORTNOY

          I'M TRYING!!
          Portnoy is not being heroic, he, is genuinely having
          trouble getting in.-the chopper.
          But then Speedman sees something...

          SPEEDMAN
          It's him...

          SPEEDMAN'S POV
          FOUR LEAF... much-like.Speedman playing him in the
          beginning of the. movie... Arms extended, his body riddled
          with bullets...

          LAZARUS

          FOOCK!
          Cody lowers the chopper ... Speedman jumps out...

          SPEEDMAN
          Cover me!
          Speedman runs towards Four Leaf, through a hailstorm of
          bullets...PORTNOY AND THE GUYS PROVIDE AS MUCH COVER AS

          THEY CAN...

          Speedman reaches Four Leaf and collapses beside him,
          cradling his head.
          Trap's men continue to bear down on them...

          FOUR LEAF
          Go on...get outta here. I'm worm food,
          you dig?

          SPEEDMAN

          DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!
          (then totally surprised)
          You have hands?

          ON THE CHOPPER
          The guys are busy shooting off their attackers, but they
          see this moment happening...

          BACK TO SPEEDMAN AND FOUR LEAF
          The life is draining from Four Leaf (Marvin)...

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't Four Leaf, Chris. We're in this
          mess because of me.

          SPEEDMAN
          (can't get over it)
          How did you get hands?

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't never been worth a nothin'...and
          it's too late to start bein' a somethin'
          now.
          Speedman tries to understand. He is welling up with
          emotion.. .real emotion.

          FOUR LEAF

          (SINCERELY)
          But you... you can tell the story. . .You
          have to tell the real story...
          And Four Leaf... or Marvin... dies.
          Speedman begins to weep. Tears. Yes, he is crying, for
          real...

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- DAY

          Peck is tied up, in ragged, prisoner clothes, hanging in
          the cage. He has been there a while.

          PECK
          Ok, look, you wanna go through this
          again, let's do it. I see more for you
          than this. This whole 'big fish in the
          little scary jungle pond' thing. I see
          you as a front man, as a leader, not just
          of this little rebel guerilla warrior
          group. I see it big picture. Is it music,
          is it movies? Is it a series on Fox? I
          don't know. But I do know it is not
          happening with you staring at me doing my
          "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" routine
          for you and the peanut gallery for
          another six months. It's old school
          already.
          TRAN and some HENCHMEN watch, unamused. Tran nods, one of
          the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into
          the water. After a moment, it comes back up with a
          soaking Peck.

          PECK
          (not missing a beat)
          And it makes me sad to see you chomping
          on the stogie and you're not even
          fourteen or whatever. I'm thinking "what
          hole does that need to fill, that you
          have to keep dipping me into the water to
          somehow feel better about yourself?" I
          can be a partner to you, not just a
          captive.

          facilitate that. And"to do that you gotta
          let me outta the cage,'both figuratively
          and literally. Until you can let me go, I
          you.can't let you go. Do you get that?
          He gets dunked in the water again.

          PECK
          Obviously not. Dare I bring up.a sore
          subject. Can we do a little business on
          the blackberry privileges? Cause you're
          killing me here.

      White letters on a black screen:
      
      The wicked flee when none pursueth.
      
      The quotation fades.
      
      A woman's voice:
      
                                             Voice-Over
                     People do not give it credence that a young girl could leave
                     home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's
                     blood, but it did happen.
      
      The street of a western town, night. The street is deserted. Snow falls.
      
      We track slowly forward.
      
                     I was just fourteen years of age when a coward by the name
                     of Tom Chaney shot my father down in Fort Smith,
                     Arkansas, and robbed him of his life and his horse and two
                     California gold pieces that he carried in his trouser band.
      
      A shape lies in the street below the busted-out porch railing of a two-story building. A
      sign identifies the building as the Monarch Boarding House.
      
                     Papa was a Cumberland Presbyterian and a Mason. He'd
                     hired Chaney--for paid wages, not on shares--when Chaney
                     was "down on his luck." If Papa had a failing it was his
                     kindly disposition; I did not get my mean streak from him.
      
      The crumpled shape is a body. We hear the thunder of approaching hooves.
      
                     He had taken Chaney up to Fort Smith to help lead back a
                     string of mustang ponies he'd just bought from a stock trader
                     named Stonehill. In town, Chaney had fallen to drink and
                     cards, and lost all his money. He got it into his head he'd
                     been cheated and went back to the boarding house for his
                     Henry rifle. Papa remonstrated, and Chaney shot him in the
                     breast.
      
      A galloping horse enters frame and recedes, whipped on by a bareback rider. A long-
      barreled rifle is tied across the rider's back with a sash cord.
                                                                                                2
      
      He disappears into the falling snow.
      
                    Chaney fled. He could have taken the time to saddle the
                    horse--or hitched up three spans of mules to a Concord
                    stagecoach and smoked a pipe, as it seems that no one in that
                    city was inclined to give chase. Chaney had mistaken its
                    citizens for men.
      
      
      DAY
      
      We are looking into the window of a moving train.
      
      Looking out past us is a fourteen-year-old girl, Mattie Ross. Next to her is Yarnell, a
      middle-aged black man. Reading backward in the mirror of the window we see a station
      sign easing in as the train slows: FORT SMITH.
      
      The voice-over continues:
      
                                          Voice-Over
                    You might say, what business was it of my father's to
                    meddle? My answer is this: he was trying to do that short
                    devil a good turn. He was his brother's keeper. Does that
                    answer your question?
      
      
      DEAD MAN'S FACE
      
      Candlelight flickers over the man's waxy features.
      
                                                   Voice
                                             (Irish-accented)
                    Is that the man?
      
      The body, wrapped in a shroud, lies in a pine coffin. Mattie and Yarnell stand looking
      down at it. An undertaker, grizzled and severely dressed, holds the candle.
      
                                                 Yarnell
                    Lord lord.
      
                                                 Mattie
                    That is my father.
                                                                        3
                              Undertaker
      If you would loik to kiss him it would be all roight.
      
                             Yarnell
      He has gone home. Praise the lord.
      
                                 Mattie
      Put the lid on. Why is it so much?
      
                              Undertaker
      The quality of the casket and of the embalming. The loifloik
      appearance requires time and art. And the chemicals come
      dear. The particulars are in your bill. If you would loik to
      kiss him it would be all roight.
      
                             Mattie
      No. Thank you. The spirit has flown. Your wire said fifty
      dollars.
      
                             Undertaker
      You did not specify he was to be shipped.
      
                                 Mattie
      Well sixty dollars is every cent we have. It leaves nothing
      for our board. Yarnell, you can see to the body's transport to
      the train station and accompany it home, and I will have to
      sleep here tonight.
      
                              Yarnell
      I don't think your mama'd want you to stay in this town by
      yourself.
      
                                   Mattie
      It can't be helped. I still have to collect father's things and
      see to some other business.
      
                               Yarnell
      But I's your chap-a-rone! Your mama didn't say for you to
      see to no business here!
      
                               Mattie
      It is business Mama doesn't know about. It's all right,
      Yarnell, I dismiss you.
                                                                                            4
                                              Yarnell
                    Well I'm not sure I--
      
                                               Mattie
                    Tell mama not to sign anything until I return home and see
                    that Papa is buried in his mason's apron.
      
      To the undertaker:
      
                    . . .Your terms are agreeable if I may pass the night here.
      
                                        Undertaker
                    Here? Among these people?
      
      Mattie looks around the empty room.
      
                                              Mattie
                    These people?
      
                                          Undertaker
                    I am expecting three more souls. Sullivan, Smith, and His
                    Tongue In The Rain.
      
                                             Mattie
                    How is it that you know in advance?
      
      
      GALLOWS
      
      Three men stand upon a rough-hewn three-banger gallows. The condemned are two white
      men and an Indian. They wear new jeans and flannel shirts buttoned to the neck. Each has
      a noose around his neck. One of the white men is addressing the crowd:
      
                                               Man
                    Ladies and gentlemen beware and train up your children in
                    the way that they should go! You see what has become of
                    me because of drink. I killed a man in a trifling quarrel over
                    a pocketknife.
      
      Mattie is pushing her way through the spectators thronging the town square.
      
      Up on the gallows the condemned speaker starts to weep.
                                                                                                5
                                                Man
                    If I had received good instruction as a child I would be with
                    my wife and children today, away out on the Cimarron
                    River. I don't know what is to become of them. I hope and
                    pray that you will not slight them and compel them to go into
                    low company.
      
      His blubbering will not let him go on. He steps back. A man standing by slips a black
      hood over his head which continues to bob with sobbing.
      
      Mattie hisses to a woman nearby:
      
                                             Mattie
                    Can you point out the sheriff?
      
      The woman indicates a figure among the officiators on the scaffold:
      
                                              Woman
                    Him with the mustaches.
      
      The second condemned man is speaking:
      
                                              Man
                    Well, I killed the wrong man is the which-of-why I'm here.
                    Had I killed the man I meant to I don't believe I would a
                    been convicted. I see men out there in that crowd is worse
                    than me.
      
      A thinking pause. He nods, shrugging.
      
                    . . . Okay.
      
      He steps back and is hooded.
      
      The third man steps forward.
      
                                              Indian
                    I would like to say--
      
      He is hooded, speech cut short. The hangman, hand to his elbow, helps him step back.
      
      The executioner pulls a lever on the scaffold. Three trapdoors swing open and three men
      drop. They hit the end of their ropes with a crack.
                                                                                                 6
                                               Crowd
                     Oh!
      
      Two of the men have their heads snapped to an angle and are limp and twist slowly. One,
      though, writhes and kicks, jackknifing his legs.
      
                                                Man
                     Oh, Sullivan must'er lost weight in prison! His neck ain't
                     broke!
      
      Sullivan continues to writhe and kick.
      
                                                Voice
                     Hot tamales?
      
      Mattie looks down at a boy selling hot tamales out of a bucket.
      
                     . . . Ten cents?
      
      
      LATER
      
      Mattie is talking to the sheriff whom we saw officiating on the scaffold. The square is
      emptying and, in the background, all three men twist slowly, the last man having finally
      given up the ghost. The Mexican boy still hawks tamales to stragglers.
      
                                               Sheriff
                     No, we ain't arrested him. Ain't caught up to him, he lit out
                     for the Territory. I would think he has throwed in with
                     Lucky Ned Pepper, whose gang robbed a mail hack
                     yesterday on the Poteau River.
      
                                             Mattie
                     Why are you not looking for him?
      
                                                Sheriff
                     I have no authority in the Indian Nation. Tom Chaney is the
                     business of the U.S. marshals now.
      
                                              Mattie
                     When will they arrest him?
      
                                                Sheriff
                     Not soon I am afraid. The marshals are not well staffed and,
                     I will tell you frankly, Chaney is at the end of a long list of
                                                                                     7
                     fugitives and malefactors.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Could I hire a marshal to pursue Tom Chaney?
      
      The sheriff looks at the girl and chuckles.
      
                                              Sheriff
                     You have a lot of experience with bounty hunters?
      
                                                 Mattie
                     My answer is this: That is a silly question. I am here to
                     settle my father's affairs.
      
                                                Sheriff
                     All alone?
      
                                               Mattie
                     I am the person for it. Mama was never any good at sums
                     and she can hardly spell cat. I intend to see papa's killer
                     hanged.
      
                                              Sheriff
                     I see. Well. Nothing prevents you from offering a reward,
                     or from so informing a marshal. It would have to be real
                     money, though, to be persuasive. Chaney is across the river
                     in the Choctaw Nation--lawless country. It will not be a
                     daisy-picking expedition. Upwards of three-score US
                     marshals have been slaughtered in the Territory.
      
                                               Mattie
                     I will see to the money. Who's the best marshal?
      
                                                 Sheriff
                     I would have to weigh that proposition. I reckon William
                     Waters is the best tracker. He is half Comanche and it is
                     something to see him cut for sign. The meanest one is
                     Rooster Cogburn. He is a pitiless man, double tough and
                     fear don't enter into his thinking. He loves to pull a cork.
                     The best is probably L.T. Quinn, he brings his prisoners in
                     alive. He may let one get by now and again but he believes
                     even the worst of men is entitled to a fair shake. Quinn is a
                     good peace officer and a lay preacher to boot. He will not
                     plant evidence or abuse a prisoner. He is as straight as
                     string. Yes, I will say Quinn is about the best they have.
                                                                                     8
      
                                              Mattie
                     Where can I find this Rooster?
      
      
      MATTIE'S HAND
      
      Rapping at a door of rough plank.
      
      After a beat, a voice--rasping and slurred:
      
                                               Voice
                     The jakes is occupied.
      
      Wider. We see that Mattie stands before an outhouse.
      
                                               Mattie
                     I know it is occupied Mr. Cogburn. As I said, I have
                     business with you.
      
      Beat.
      
                                               Voice
                     I have prior business.
      
                                               Mattie
                     You have been at it for quite some time, Mr. Cogburn.
      
                                               Voice
                                          (roaring drunk)
                     There is no clock on my business! To hell with you! To hell
                     with you! How did you stalk me here?!
      
                                               Mattie
                     The sheriff told me to look in the saloon. In the saloon they
                     referred me here. We must talk.
      
                                              Voice
                                           (outraged)
                     Women ain't allowed in the saloon!
      
                                               Mattie
                     I was not there as a customer. I am fourteen years old.
      
      No response. Mattie reaches up and raps again, vigorously.
                                                                                                   9
      
      Beat.
      
                                              Voice
                                             (sullen)
                     The jakes is occupied. And will be for some time.
      
      
      PLANK FLOOR
      
      A coffin is dropped heavily into frame and we see, chalked onto the freshly milled wood of
      its top:
      
                                                  Ross
                                              Yell County
                                             Hold at station
      
      After a resting beat, during which the coffin's handlers presumably adjust their grip, the
      coffin is shoved away over the straw-littered planking of a rail freight car. Once it has
      been pushed fully in, the upright planking of the boxcar door blurs through frame in the
      extreme foreground til the door slams to rest.
      
      We hear the steam engine start to chug, and the foreground door moves slowly off with the
      grinding motion of the train.
      
      
      SHOP DOOR
      
      Swinging open. It is the barnlike door to the mortician's workroom; the Irish undertaker
      holds it open for Mattie. She carries a bedroll.
      
                                             Undertaker
                     You can sleep in a coffin if you loik.
      
      Three bodies lay under shrouds on a high work table. The arm of the nearest sticks out,
      rope burns on its wrist. Three coffins are in various stages of assembly.
      
      Mattie unwinds the bedroll onto the floor.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Not. . . yet.
      
      
      STREET
                                                                                                  10
      Mattie strides along, looking at facades. She stops, looking at the signage on a barnlike
      building:
      
                        Col. G. Stonehill. Licensed Auctioneer. Cotton Factor.
      
      
      INSIDE
      
      Mattie steps to the doorway of an office set in a corner of the stable.
      
                                            Mattie
                     How much are you paying for cotton?
      
      Stonehill looks up from his desk. He eyes the girl up and down.
      
                                             Stonehill
                     Nine and a half for low middling and ten for ordinary.
      
                                               Mattie
                     We got most of ours out early and sold it to Woodson
                     Brothers in Little Rock for eleven cents.
      
                                             Stonehill
                     Then I suggest you take the balance of it to the Woodson
                     Brothers.
      
                                             Mattie
                     We took the balance to Woodson. We got ten and a half.
      
                                           Stonehill
                     Why did you come here to tell me this?
      
                                                Mattie
                     I thought we might shop around up here next year but I guess
                     we are doing all right in Little Rock. I am Mattie Ross,
                     daughter of Frank Ross.
      
      Stonehill sets his pen down and leans back.
      
                                             Stonehill
                     A tragic thing. May I say your father impressed me with his
                     manly qualities. He was a close trader but he acted the
                     gentleman.
                                                                                     11
                                               Mattie
                    I propose to sell those ponies back to you that my father
                    bought.
      
                                                Stonehill
                    That, I fear, is out of the question. I will see that they are
                    shipped to you at my earliest convenience.
      
                                            Mattie
                    We don't want the ponies now. We don't need them.
      
                                            Stonehill
                    Well that hardly concerns me. Your father bought those five
                    ponies and paid for them and there is an end of it. I have the
                    bill of sale.
      
      Beat.
      
                                             Mattie
                    And I want three hundred dollars for Papa's saddle horse that
                    was stolen from your stable.
      
                                             Stonehill
                    You will have to take that up with the man who stole the
                    horse.
      
                                            Mattie
                    Tom Chaney stole the horse while it was in your care. You
                    are responsible.
      
      Stonehill chuckles.
      
                                             Stonehill
                    I admire your sand but I believe you will find that I am not
                    liable for such claims.
      
                                              Mattie
                    You were custodian. If you were a bank and were robbed
                    you could not simply tell the depositors to go hang.
      
                                             Stonehill
                    I do not entertain hypotheticals, the world as it is is vexing
                    enough. Secondly, your valuation of the horse is high by
                    about two hundred dollars. How old are you?
                                                                                     12
                                                Mattie
                     If anything my price is low. Judy is a fine racing mare. She
                     has won purses of twenty-five dollars; I have seen her jump
                     an eight-rail fence with a heavy rider. I am fourteen.
      
                                               Stonehill
                     Hmm. Well, that's all very interesting. The ponies are
                     yours, take them. Your father's horse was stolen by a
                     murderous criminal. I had provided reasonable protection
                     for the creature as per our implicit agreement. My watchman
                     had his teeth knocked out and can take only soup. We must
                     each bear his own misfortunes.
      
                                               Mattie
                     I will take it to law.
      
                                              Stonehill
                     You have no case.
      
                                              Mattie
                     Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle, Arkansas may think
                     otherwise--as might a jury, petitioned by a widow and three
                     small children.
      
                                              Stonehill
                     Where is your mother?
      
                                              Mattie
                     She is at home in Yell County looking after my sister
                     Victoria and my brother Little Frank.
      
                                            Stonehill
                     I cannot make an agreement with a minor child. You are not
                     accountable.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Lawyer Dagget will back up any decision I make, you may
                     rest easy on that score. You can confirm any agreement by
                     telegraph.
      
      Stonehill stares.
      
                                              Stonehill
                     I will pay two hundred dollars to your father's estate when I
                     have in my hand a letter from your lawyer absolving me of
                                                                       13
      all liability from the beginning of the world to date. The
      offer is more than liberal and I make it only to avoid the
      possibility of troublesome litigation.
      
                                Mattie
      I will take two hundred dollars for Judy, plus one hundred
      for the ponies and twenty-five dollars for the gray horse that
      Tom Chaney left. He is easily worth forty. That is three
      hundred twenty-five dollars total.
      
                              Stonehill
      The ponies have no part of this. I will not buy them.
      
                                Mattie
      Then the price for Judy is three hundred twenty-five dollars.
      
                              Stonehill
      I would not pay three hundred and twenty-five dollars for
      winged Pegasus! As for the gray horse, it does not belong to
      you! And you are a snip!
      
                               Mattie
      The gray was lent to Tom Chaney by my father. Chaney
      only had the use of him. Your other points are beneath
      comment.
      
                              Stonehill
      I will pay two hundred and twenty-five dollars and keep the
      gray horse. I don't want the ponies.
      
                                  Mattie
      I cannot accept that. (she stands) There can be no
      settlement after I leave this office. It will go to law.
      
                                 Stonehill
      This is my last offer. Two hundred and fifty dollars. For
      that I get the release previously discussed and I keep your
      father's saddle. I am also writing off a feed and stabling
      charge. The gray horse is not yours to sell. You are an
      unnatural child.
      
                                 Mattie
      The saddle is not for sale. I will keep it. Lawyer Dagget can
      prove ownership of the gray horse. He will come after you
      with a writ of replevin.
                                                                                             14
      
                                              Stonehill
                    A what? All right, now listen very carefully as I will not
                    bargain further. I will take the ponies back and keep the gray
                    horse which is mine and settle for three hundred dollars.
                    Now you must take that or leave it and I do not much care
                    which it is.
      
                                             Mattie
                    Lawyer Daggett would not wish me to consider anything
                    under three hundred twenty-five dollars. But I will settle for
                    three hundred and twenty if I am given the twenty in
                    advance. And here is what I have to say about the saddle--
      
      
      STREET
      
      We are tracking down the street we toward the Monarch Boarding House.
      
      Mattie is humping a saddle up the street. She stops before the boarding house. She looks
      at its sign. She looks at its busted-out porch railing.
      
      
      INSIDE THE PARLOR
      
      A Marjorie Main-like woman crushes Mattie to her bosom.
      
                                          Mrs. Floyd
                    Frank Ross's daughter. My poor child. My poor child.
      
      Mattie grimaces, arms pinned to her sides.
      
                                             Mattie
                    You have my father's traps?
      
                                            Mrs. Floyd
                    Oh yes we do. My poor child. Are you gawna be stayin
                    with us or are you hurrying home to your mother?
      
                                              Mattie
                    I am staying briefly. I have business with Marshal Rooster
                    Cogburn. I found him in his cups today but I understand
                    he's to be in court tomorrow, testifying. I mean to engage
                    him to hunt down Tom Chaney.
                                                                                               15
                                            Mrs. Floyd
                     Well god bless him for that. The tariff here is seventy-five
                     cents for room and supper. That does not include your
                     daytime eats.
      
                                                Mattie
                     Very well.
      
                                            Mrs. Floyd
                     Your father owed for two days, god bless him.
      
                                                Mattie
                     Oh. Well.
      
                                            Mrs. Floyd
                     You'll share a room with Grandma Turner. We've had to
                     double up, what with all the people in town come to see the
                     hanging Judge Parker's put on for us.
      
                                              Mattie
                     Yes, I witnessed the hanging myself.
      
                                              Mrs. Floyd
                     Was it a good'n?
      
      
      BEDROOM
      
      A blanket is unrolled to reveal a watch, a cheap knife, and a long-barreled Colt's dragoon
      revolver. Voice off:
      
                                               Mrs. Floyd
                     This was in the poor man's room. This is everything, there
                     are no light fingers in this house. If you need something for
                     to tote the gun around I will give you an empty flour sack for
                     a nickel.
      
      
      DARK ROOM
      
      We hear wind whistling through cracks in the floorboards and walls.
      
      We hear snoring.
      
      There is one bed, not large, with two shapes in it.
                                                                                                 16
      
      We cut in closer to find Mattie lying on her back, staring. She shivers, shoulders hunched.
      The thin blanket barely covers her.
      
      She pulls the blanket gently, slowly, so that it covers her exposed side.
      
      A beat of snoring, a snorfle, and then, as we hold on Mattie, the crackle of mattress ticking
      under a shifting body--and the blanket is pulled away toward the unseen snorer.
      
      
      COURT HALLWAY
      
      Voices echo from inside the courtroom. Mattie cracks a heavy oak door and slips in.
      
      
      COURTROOM
      
      The gallery is crowded. Mattie is at the back of a press of standees.
      
      Her point-of-view, semi-obstructed: on the witness stand is Rooster Cogburn, a rough-
      hewn man going to middle-aged fat. He has a patch over one eye.
      
                                               Cogburn
                     The woman was out in the yard dead with blowflies on her
                     face and the old man was inside with his breast blowed open
                     by a scatter-gun and his feet burned. He was still alive but
                     just was. He said them two Wharton boys had done it, rode
                     up drunk--
      
                                             Mr. Goudy
                     Objection. Hearsay.
      
                                           Mr. Barlow
                     Dying declaration, your honor.
      
                                             Judge
                     Overruled. Procede, Mr. Cogburn.
      
                                                Cogburn
                     Them two Wharton boys--that'd be Odus and C.C.--
                     throwed down on him, asked him where his money was,
                     when he wouldn't talk lit pine knots and held 'em to his feet.
                     He told 'em in a fruit jar under a gray rock at one corner of
                     the smokehouse.
                                                                      17
                              Mr. Barlow
      And then?
      
                              Cogburn
      Well he died on us. Passed away in considerable pain.
      
                              Mr. Barlow
      What did you do then?
      
                             Cogburn
      Me and Marshal Potter went out to the smokehouse and that
      rock had been moved and that jar was gone.
      
                            Mr. Goudy
      Objection. Speculative.
      
                                 Judge
      Sustained.
      
                             Mr. Barlow
      You found a flat gray rock at the corner of the smokehouse
      with a hollowed-out space under it?
      
                               Mr. Goudy
      If the prosecutor is going to give evidence I suggest that he
      be sworn.
      
                            Mr. Barlow
      Marshal Cogburn, what did you find, if anything, at the
      corner of the smokehouse?
      
                              Cogburn
      We found a flat gray rock with a hollowed-out space under
      it. Nothin there.
      
                              Mr. Barlow
      And what did--
      
                               Cogburn
      No jar or nothin.
      
                              Mr. Barlow
      What did you do then?
                                                                     18
                              Cogburn
      Well we rode up to the Whartons', near where the North
      Fork strikes the Canadian, branch of the Canadian.
      
                            Mr. Barlow
      And what did you find?
      
                               Cogburn
      I had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old
      daddy, Aaron Wharton, down there on the creek bank with
      some hogs. They'd killed a shoat and was butchering it.
      They'd built a fire under a wash pot for scalding water.
      
                              Mr. Barlow
      What did you do?
      
                               Cogburn
      Crept down. I announced that we was U.S. marshals and
      hollered to Aaron that we needed to talk to his boys. He
      picked up a axe and commenced to cussing us and
      blackguarding this court.
      
                              Mr. Barlow
      What did you do then?
      
                               Cogburn
      Backed away trying to talk some sense into him. But C.C.
      edges over by the wash pot and picks up a shotgun. Potter
      seen him but it was too late. C.C. Wharton pulled down on
      Potter with one barrel and then turned to do the same for me
      with the other. I shot him and when the old man swung the
      axe I shot him. Odus lit out and I shot him. Aaron Wharton
      and C.C. Wharton was dead when they hit the ground but
      Odus was just winged.
      
                              Mr. Barlow
      Did you find the jar with the hundred and twenty dollars in
      it?
      
                              Mr. Goudy
      Leading.
      
                                Judge
      Sustained.
                                                                   19
                                Mr. Barlow
      What happened then?
      
                                Cogburn
      I found the jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it.
      
                           Mr. Barlow
      And what happened to Marshal Potter?
      
                             Cogburn
      Died. Leaves a wife and six babies.
      
                                Mr. Goudy
      Objection.
      
                                  Judge
      Strike the comment.
      
                          Mr. Barlow
      And what became of Odus Wharton?
      
                                 Cogburn
      There he sets.
      
                          Mr. Barlow
      Okay. You may ask, Mr. Goudy.
      
                           Mr. Goudy
      Thank you, Mr. Barlow. In your four years as U.S. marshal,
      Mr. Cogburn, how many men have you shot?
      
                                Mr. Barlow
      Objection.
      
                               Mr. Goudy
      There is more to this shooting than meets the eye, Judge
      Parker. I will establish the bias of this witness.
      
                                  Judge
      Objection is overruled.
      
                         Mr. Goudy
      How many, Mr. Cogburn?
                                                                            20
                                       Cogburn
              I never shot nobody I didn't have to.
      
                                     Mr. Goudy
              That was not the question. How many?
      
                                        Cogburn
              . . . Shot or killed?
      
                                         Mr. Goudy
              Let us restrict it to "killed" so that we may have a
              manageable figure.
      
                                      Cogburn
              Around twelve or fifteen. Stopping men in flight, defending
              myself, et cetera.
      
                                     Mr. Goudy
              Around twelve or fifteen. So many that you cannot keep a
              precise count. Remember, you are under oath. I have
              examined the records and can supply the accurate figure.
      
      Beat.
      
                                     Cogburn
              I believe them two Whartons make twenty-three.
      
                                   Mr. Goudy
              Twenty-three dead men in four years.
      
                                       Cogburn
              It is a dangerous business.
      
                                 Mr. Goudy
              How many members of this one family, the Wharton family,
              have you killed?
      
                                        Cogburn
              Immediate, or--
      
                                      Mr. Barlow
              Your honor, perhaps counsel should be advised that the
              marshal is not the defendant in this action.
                                                                     21
                              Mr. Barlow
      The history is relevant your honor. Goes to Cogburn's
      methods and animosities.
      
                                 Judge
      Okay.
      
                             Mr. Barlow
      Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother, and Clete
      Wharton, half-brother?
      
                               Cogburn
      Clete was selling ardent spirits to the Cherokee. He come at
      me with a king bolt.
      
                            Mr. Goudy
      You were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing but
      a king bolt? From a wagon tongue?
      
                              Cogburn
      I've seen men badly tore up with things no bigger than a
      king bolt. I defended myself.
      
                              Mr. Goudy
      And, returning to the encounter with Aaron and his two
      remaining sons, you sprang from cover with your revolver in
      hand?
      
                                Cogburn
      I did.
      
                              Mr. Goudy
      Loaded and cocked?
      
                                Cogburn
      If it ain't loaded and cocked it don't shoot.
      
                             Mr. Goudy
      And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced against an armed
      man?
      
                            Cogburn
      He was armed. He had that axe raised.
                                                                     22
                              Mr. Goudy
      Yes. I believe you testified that you backed away from
      Aaron Wharton?
      
                              Cogburn
      That is right.
      
                            Mr. Goudy
      Which direction were you going?
      
                             Cogburn
      I always go backwards when I'm backing up.
      
                            Mr. Goudy
      Very amusing I suppose--for all of us except Aaron
      Wharton. Now, he advanced upon you much in the manner
      of Clete Wharton menacing you with that king bolt or rolled-
      up newspaper or whatever it was.
      
                            Cogburn
      Yes sir. He commenced to cussing and laying about with
      threats.
      
                           Mr. Goudy
      And you were backing away? How many steps before the
      shooting started?
      
                              Cogburn
      Seven, eight steps?
      
                            Mr. Goudy
      Aaron Wharton keeping pace, advancing, away from the fire
      seven eight steps--what would that be, fifteen, twenty feet?
      
                              Cogburn
      I suppose.
      
                               Mr. Goudy
      Will you explain to the jury, Mr. Cogburn, why Mr. Wharton
      was found immediately by the wash pot with one arm in the
      fire, his sleeve and hand smoldering?
      
                              Cogburn
      Well.
                                                                                             23
                                         Mr. Goudy
                    Did you move the body after you shot him?
      
                                              Cogburn
                    Why would I do that?
      
                                           Mr. Goudy
                    You did not drag his body over to the fire? Fling his arm in?
      
                                              Cogburn
                    No sir.
      
                                           Mr. Goudy
                    Two witnesses who arrived on the scene will testify to the
                    location of the body. You do not remember moving the
                    body? So it was a bushwack, as he tended his campfire?
      
                                           Mr. Barlow
                    Objection.
      
                                              Cogburn
                    I, if that was where the body was I might have moved him. I
                    do not remember.
      
                                        Mr. Goudy
                    Why would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?
      
                                           Cogburn
                    Them hogs rooting around might have moved him. I do not
                    remember.
      
      
      COURTHOUSE PORCH
      
      Mattie waits as people file out. She pushes forward to meet Cogburn when he emerges,
      muttering.
      
                                              Cogburn
                    Son of a goddamn bitch.
      
                                              Mattie
                    Rooster Cogburn?
      
                                              Cogburn
                    What is it.
                                                                                            24
      
      He does not look up from the cigarette he is trying to roll. His hands are shaking.
      
                                                Mattie
                     I would like to talk with you a minute.
      
                                                Cogburn
                     What is it.
      
                                              Mattie
                     They tell me you are a man with true grit.
      
                                             Cogburn
                     What do you want, girl? Speak up. It is suppertime.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Let me do that.
      
      She takes the fixings and rolls, licks, and twists the cigarette.
      
                     . . . Your makings are too dry. I am looking for the man who
                     shot and killed my father, Frank Ross, in front of the
                     Monarch boarding house. The man's name is Tom Chaney.
                     They say he is over in Indian Territory and I need somebody
                     to go after him.
      
                                                Cogburn
                     What is your name, girl?
      
                                              Mattie
                     My name is Mattie Ross. We are located in Yell County.
                     My mother is at home looking after my sister Victoria and
                     my brother Little Frank.
      
                                            Cogburn
                     You had best go home to them. They will need help with the
                     churning.
      
                                               Mattie
                     There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney. The government
                     will pay you two dollars for bringing him in plus ten cents a
                     mile for each of you. On top of that I will pay you a fifty-
                     dollar reward.
      
      Cogburn gazes at her.
                                                                                                    25
      
                                              Cogburn
                     What are you? (looks at the flour sack she holds) What've
                     you got there in your poke?
      
      She opens it. Cogburn smiles.
      
                     . . . By God! A Colt's dragoon! Why, you're no bigger than
                     a corn nubbin, what're you doing with a pistol like that?
      
                                              Mattie
                     I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it if the law fails to do so.
      
                                               Cogburn
                     Well, that piece will do the job--if you can find a high
                     stump to rest it on and a wall to put behind you.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Nobody here knew my father and I am afraid nothing much
                     is going to be done about Chaney except I do it. My brother
                     is a child and my mother is indecisive and hobbled by grief.
      
                                              Cogburn
                     I don't believe you have fifty dollars.
      
                                                Mattie
                     I will shortly. I have a contract with Colonel Stonehill which
                     he will make payment on tomorrow or the next day, once a
                     lawyer countersigns.
      
                                                Cogburn
                     I don't believe fairy tales or sermons or stories about money,
                     baby sister. But thank you for the cigarette.
      
      
      EVENING--BOARDING HOUSE PORCH
      
      Mattie climbs the few steps from the street. Her attention is drawn by:
      
      A man sitting on a chair to one side enjoying the quiet of the evening. He is dressed for
      riding, with perhaps a bit too much panache. It is almost dark and he is hard to see but it
      seems he is watching Mattie, amused.
      
      He raises a pipe to his mouth and pulls at it. The glow from the excited bowl kicks on his
      eyes, which are indeed tracking her.
                                                                                                  26
      
      Mattie, discomfited by his look, turns hastily forward and pushes open the door. A
      jingling sound prompts one more glance to the side.
      
      The man's face is now hidden by his hat. Just before Mattie's point of view, now a lateral
      track, starts to lose him behind the door jamb, he raises a spurred boot to push against the
      porch rail and tip his chair back. He raises his other foot, spur jingling, and drapes it over
      the first.
      
      
      INSIDE
      
      We are pushing in on the landlady.
      
                                                Landlady
                       Isn't your mother expecting you home, dear? I did not think
                       to see you this evening.
      
                                                 Mattie
                       My business is not yet finished. Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms
                       opened up? Grandma Turner. . . the bed is quite narrow.
      
                                                Landlady
                       The second-floor back did open up but the gentleman on the
                       porch has just taken it. But don't worry yourself, dear--you
                       are not disturbing Grandma Turner.
      
      
      DARK BEDROOM
      
      As before, unseen Grandma Turner snores loudly as wind whistles and Mattie shivers.
      
      Fade to black.
      
      Very quiet.
      
      In the quiet, a faint crickle-crackle of flame. It is followed by a lip-pop and a deep inhale.
      
      Mattie opens her eyes. She is beaded with sweat. She looks blearily up.
      
      The room is dim. A man sits facing her in a straghtback chair, faintly backlit by the
      daylight leaking through the curtained window behind him. He exhales pipesmoke.
      
                                               Cowboy
                       You are sleeping the day away.
                                                                                               27
      
                                               Mattie
                     I am not well.
      
      The man rises and, spurs jingling, crosses to the window, and throws open the curtain.
      
      Mattie squints at him against the daylight:
      
      The man has a cowlick and barndoor ears and is once again well-accoutered for riding. He
      steps away from the window and reseats himself.
      
                                            Cowboy
                     You do not look well. My name is LeBoeuf. I have just
                     come from Yell County.
      
                                            Mattie
                     We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     A saucy line will not get you far with me. I saw your mother
                     yesterday morning. She says for you to come right on home.
      
                                           Mattie
                     Hm. What was your business there?
      
      LeBoeuf takes a small photograph from his coat.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     This is a man I think you know.
      
      Mattie looks at the picture through red-rimmed eyes.
      
                     . . . You called him Tom Chaney, I believe. . .
      
      Mattie declines to contradict. LeBoeuf continues:
      
                     . . . though in the months I have been tracking him he has
                     used the names Theron Chelmsford, John Todd Andersen,
                     and others. He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana, and Pine Bluff,
                     Arkansas before turning up at your father's place.
      
                                             Mattie
                     Why did you not catch him in Monroe, Louisiana or Pine
                     Bluff, Arkansas?
                                                                                               28
                                               LeBoeuf
                     He is a crafty one.
      
                                              Mattie
                     I thought him slow-witted myself.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     That was his act.
      
                                              Mattie
                     It was a good one. Are you some kind of law?
      
      LeBoeuf tips back in his chair and draws back his coat to display a star. A smug look.
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     That's right. I am a Texas Ranger.
      
                                              Mattie
                     That may make you a big noise in that state; in Arkansas you
                     should mind that your Texas trappings and title do not make
                     you an object of fun. Why have you been ineffectually
                     pursuing Chaney?
      
      LeBoeuf's smile stays in place with effort.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs down in
                     Waco, Texas. The Bibbs family have put out a reward.
      
                                           Mattie
                     How came Chaney to shoot a state senator?
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     My understanding is there was an argument about a dog. Do
                     you know anything about where Chaney has gone?
      
                                                Mattie
                     He is in the Territory, and I hold out little hope for you
                     earning your bounty.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     Why is that?
      
                                              Mattie
                     My man will beat you to it. I have hired a deputy marshal,
                                                                                                29
                     the toughest one they have, and he is familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper
                     gang that they say Chaney has tied up with.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     Well, I will throw in with you and your marshal.
      
                                           Mattie
                     No. Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     It'll be to our mutual advantage. Your marshal I presume
                     knows the Territory; I know Chaney. It is at least a two-man
                     job taking him alive.
      
                                             Mattie
                     When Chaney is taken he is coming back to Fort Smith to
                     hang. I am not having him go to Texas to hang for shooting
                     some senator.
      
                                            LeBoeuf
                     Haw-haw! It is not important where he hangs, is it?
      
                                                  Mattie
                     It is to me. Is it to you?
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     It means a great deal of money to me. It's been many
                     months' work.
      
                                               Mattie
                     I'm sorry that you are paid piecework not on wages, and that
                     you have been eluded the winter long by a halfwit. Marshal
                     Cogburn and I are fine.
      
      LeBoeuf stands.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements.
                     While I sat there watching you I gave some thought to
                     stealing a kiss, though you are very young and sick and
                     unattractive to boot, but now I have a mind to give you five
                     or six good licks with my belt.
      
      Mattie rolls away onto her side.
                                                                                               30
                                               Mattie
                     One would be as unpleasant as the other. If you wet your
                     comb, it might tame that cowlick.
      
      Her eyelids droop.
      
      Spurs jingle and fade away.
      
      Distant voices from the street. Clanging church bell. Very close, the clink of bottle
      against cup.
      
      Mattie looks blearily over. The room is now filled with long shadows.
      
      The landlady has materialized at the side of the bed. She is pouring something from a
      bottle into a ceramic cup.
      
                                              Landlady
                     Try some Dr. Underwood's. You may feel giddy but do not
                     be alarmed as that is only the medicine working.
      
      Mattie obediently rises to an elbow, drinks, then drops back onto the pillow. A clunk:
      
      The landlady has set the bottle down on the nightstand.
      
      Mattie squints at the bottle:
      
                                    Dr. Underwood's Bile Activator
                                 Approved by Physicians and Clergymen
      
      The room's shadows grow longer still and crawl up the bottle.
      
      The voice of the unseen landlady echoes and trails away:
      
                                                Landlady
                     I will charge you ten cents. It probably means a loss for me,
                     but it is hard to figure the exact proportion of the bottle. . .
      
      From outside, the sound of a horse approaching at a gallop.
      
      We cut outside. It is snowing, and night again.
      
      Frank Ross's body is once again in the street before the boarding house.
      
      The bareback horseman enters frame and recedes, rifle tied to his back.
                                                                                                 31
      A saddled horse stands in the middle of the street, pointed at the receding Tom Chaney.
      
      Chaney disappears down the dark street into the falling snow.
      
      Small hands reach up and wrap the saddlehorn on the waiting horse.
      
      Mattie's face appears over the saddle as she tries to pull herself up.
      
      Close on her feet rising from the ground, then pedaling, seeking purchase. There are no
      stirrups.
      
      Close on Mattie again. Sweating, she succeeds in chinning and elbowing herself onto the
      horse's back. The sound of the fleeing horseman has receded almost to nothing.
      
      She gets herself arranged in the saddle. She looks down for the reins.
      
      The reins hang down from the bit.
      
      She lies forward onto the horse's neck, a fistful of mane in one hand, reaching with the
      other. . . reaching down. . . her fingers curl around the reins. . . she pulls.
      
      The horse tosses its head and rears.
      
      Mattie's legs squeeze the horses flanks.
      
      Her fingers tighten on the horses mane but she is slipping, falling. . .
      
      In the boarding house bedroom Mattie's hands clutch at pillow.
      
      It is dark.
      
      A phlegm-hawking sound.
      
      A woman in a nightgown, face obscured by sleeping bonnet, approaches the bed and
      disappears around its far side.
      
      The sound of the old woman climbing into bed and settling.
      
      After a beat, the covers are yanked from Mattie.
      
      After another beat--snoring.
      
      
      POST OFFICE
                                                                                            32
      The door bangs open at the cut and Mattie emerges with an envelope.
      
      It is day.
      
      
      STREET
      
      Mattie walks down the street holding the ripped-open envelope in one hand and some
      unfolded papers in the other, the topmost of which she reads as she walks.
      
      We hear the letter's contents in a gruff male voice-over:
      
                                                Letter
                     Mattie. I wish you would leave these matters entirely to me,
                     or at the very least do me the courtesy of consulting me
                     before entering such agreements. I am not scolding you, but
                     I am saying your headstrong ways will lead you into a tight
                     corner one day. I trust the enclosed document will let you
                     conclude your business and return to Dardanelle. Your
                     mother is in a panic and begging me to fetch you back home.
                     Yours, J. Noble Dagget.
      
      
      PAPERS
      
      Thrust onto a desk.
      
      Wider shows that we are once again in the office of Stonehill, the stock trader. He
      examines the release through bleary eyes, displaying none of his former vinegar.
      
                                               Mattie
                     I was as bad yesterday as you look today. I was forced to
                     share a bed with Grandma Turner.
      
      The trader's eyes are still on the paper:
      
                                                Stonehill
                     I am not acquainted with Grandma Turner. If she is a
                     resident of this city it does not surprise me that she carries
                     disease. I was told this malarial place was to be the Chicago
                     of the Southwest. Well, my little friend, it is not the Chicago
                     of the Southwest. I cannot rightly say what it is, but it has
                     ruined my health as it has my finances.
      
      He drops the paper.
                                                                                        33
      
                    . . . I owe you money.
      
      He works a key in a drawer and takes out money and counts during the following.
      
                                             Mattie
                    You have not traded poorly.
      
                                            Stonehill
                    Certainly not. I am paying you for a horse I do not possess
                    and have bought back a string of useless ponies I cannot sell
                    again.
      
                                              Mattie
                    You are forgetting the gray horse.
      
                                              Stonehill
                    Crowbait.
      
                                              Mattie
                    You are looking at the thing in the wrong light.
      
                                               Stonehill
                    I am looking at it in the light of God's eternal truth.
      
      He hands the money across and Mattie counts to confirm.
      
                                               Mattie
                    Your illness is putting you "down in the dumps." You will
                    soon find a buyer for the ponies.
      
                                              Stonehill
                    I have a tentative offer of ten dollars per head from the
                    Pfitzer Soap Works of Little Rock.
      
                                             Mattie
                    It would be a shame to destroy such spirited horseflesh.
      
                                            Stonehill
                    So it would. I am confident the deal will fall through.
      
                                             Mattie
                    Look here. I need a pony. I will pay ten dollars for one of
                    them.
                                                                                                 34
                                                Stonehill
                     No. That was lot price. No no. Wait a minute. Are we
                     trading again? I just handed you twenty dollars each for
                     those ponies and you now propose to buy one back for ten?
                     Little girl: I will give you ten dollars to refrain from doing
                     any more business here. It would be the most astute deal I
                     have struck in Arkansas.
      
      
      STABLE
      
      We are tracking along a line of stalls toward a small corral holding a black mustang,
      among other ponies.
      
      Mattie is approaching the horse. A black stablehand has been trailing her, humping her
      father's saddle.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     This one is beautiful.
      
      She rubs the muzzle of the black horse.
      
      She takes the saddle from the stablehand and tries to throw it over the horse. She is not tall
      or strong enough.
      
      The stableboy helps, then helps her up.
      
      The horse does not move for a long beat.
      
      The stableboy is laughing.
      
                                            Stableboy
                     He don't know they's a person up there. You too light.
      
      She kicks lightly and the horse abruptly pitches once or twice and then starts prancing.
      
      The stableboy, still laughing, stands in the middle of a circle defined by the prancing horse.
      
                                             Stableboy
                     He thinks he got a horsefly on him.
      
      Mattie leans forward to calm the horse, rubbing the muzzle and shushing him.
      
      She straightens.
                                                                                              35
                                                 Mattie
                     He is very spirited. I will call him "Little Blackie."
      
                                              Stableboy
                     Das a good name.
      
                                               Mattie
                     What does he like for a treat?
      
                                             Stableboy
                     Ma'am, he is a horse, so he likes apples.
      
      She reins the horse around and heads for the door, calling back:
      
                                              Mattie
                     Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.
      
      The receding stableboy is uncomfortable.
      
                                              Stableboy
                     No ma'am. . . I ain't s'posed to utter your name.
      
      
      CANVAS FLAP
      
      Whipped up at the cut.
      
      Peering in is Mattie; holding the makeshift curtain open is an elderly Chinese.
      
      Behind them we can see the shelves of a modest grocery store and in the deep background
      its bright street-facing window.
      
                                               Chinese
                     See. Sleep.
      
      Reverse: a squalid living area crowded with effects. It is dim. There is snoring. Rooster
      Cogburn is in a Chinese rope bed, his weight bowing it almost to the ground.
      
      Mattie steps in.
      
                                                Mattie
                     That is fine. I will wake him.
      
                                               Chinese
                     Won't like.
                                                                                               36
      
      Mattie ignores him, poking at Rooster as the grocer withdraws, letting the canvas drop
      behind him.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Mr. Cogburn, it is I. Mattie Ross, your employer.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Whuh.
      
                                              Mattie
                     How long til you are ready to go?
      
      Rooster opens his eyes, blinks.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Go whar?
      
                                                Mattie
                     Into the Indian Territory. In pursuit of Tom Chaney.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Whah. . .
      
      He focuses on Mattie, swings his legs out, rumbles, and spits on the floor.
      
                     . . . Oh.
      
      He reaches over a pouch of tobacco and begins fumbling with cigarette makings.
      
                     . . . Chaney. You are the bereaved girl with stories of El
                     Dorado. Mr. Lee! Why are you admitting callers!
      
      A voice from the front of the store:
      
                                               Grocer
                     Toad her no good!
      
      Mattie takes out some cash.
      
                                                   Mattie
                     I said fifty dollars to retrieve Chaney. You did not believe
                     me?
      
      Rooster is sobered by the sight of the currency.
                                                                                                  37
      
                                                Rooster
                        Well, I did not know. You are a hard one to figure.
      
                                                Mattie
                        How long for you to make ready to depart?
      
      Mattie takes the cigarette fixings at which Rooster is fumbling and works on a cigarette.
      
                                                 Rooster
                        Well now wait now, sis. I remember your offer but do not
                        remember agreeing to it. If I'm going up against Ned
                        Pepper I will need a hundred dollars. I can tell you that
                        much. Hundred dollars! I am not pursuing his gang through
                        Arkansas, where there is law, and the criminal is out of his
                        element. They are in the Territory, in their element, where
                        there is no law and the marshal stands alone.
      
      He spits again.
      
                        . . . Hundred dollars is the right amount. I will take those
                        fifty dollars in advance. There will be expenses.
      
                                                  Mattie
                        You are trying to take advantage of me.
      
                                                 Rooster
                        I am giving you the children's rate. I am not a sharper, I am
                        an old man sleeping in a rope bed in a room behind a
                        Chinese grocery. I should burn this damn thing. It is no
                        good for my back, sister. I have nothing.
      
      She hands him the finished cigarette.
      
                                                 Mattie
                        You want to be kept in whiskey.
      
      Rooster is patting at his chest.
      
                                                   Rooster
                        I don't have to buy that, I confiscate it. I am an officer of the
                        court.
      
      She lights his cigarette.
                                                                                     38
                    . . . Thank you. Hundred dollars. That is the rate.
      
                                              Mattie
                    I shall not niggle. Can we depart this afternoon?
      
                                               Rooster
                    We?!
      
      The word detonates a fit of coughing.
      
                    . . . You are not going. That is no part of it.
      
                                              Mattie
                    You misjudge me if you think I am silly enough to give you
                    fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off.
      
                                           Rooster
                    I am a bonded U.S. marshal!
      
                                               Mattie
                    That weighs but little with me. I will see the thing done.
      
                                            Rooster
                    You never said anything about this. I cannot go up against
                    Ned Pepper and a band of hard men and look after a baby at
                    the same time.
      
                                               Mattie
                    I am not a baby.
      
                                               Rooster
                    I will not be stopping at boarding houses with warm beds
                    and plates of hot grub on the table. It will be traveling fast
                    and eating light. What little sleeping is done will take place
                    on the ground.
      
                                               Mattie
                    I have slept out at night. Papa took me and Little Frank coon
                    hunting last summer on the Petit Jean. We were in the
                    woods all night. We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told
                    ghost stories. We had a good time.
      
                                              Rooster
                    Coon hunting! This ain't no coon hunt, it don't come within
                    forty miles of being a coon hunt!
                                                                                                39
      
                                                Mattie
                     It is the same idea as a coon hunt. You are just trying to
                     make your work sound harder than it is. Here is the money.
                     I aim to get Tom Chaney and if you are not game I will find
                     somebody who is game. All I have heard out of you so far is
                     talk. I know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and
                     wallow in filth and bemoan your station. The rest has been
                     braggadocio. They told me you had grit and that is why I
                     came to you. I am not paying for talk. I can get all the talk I
                     need and more at the Monarch Boarding House.
      
      Rooster stares, nonplussed.
      
      He drops back into the rope bed, which sets it swaying. As he stares up at the ceiling:
      
                                              Rooster
                     Leave the money. Meet me here tomorrow morning at seven
                     o'clock and we will begin our coon hunt.
      
      
      GRANDMA TURNER'S ROOM
      
      Mattie makes early-morning preparations to leave as Grandma Turner snores. She unrolls
      her father's traps and takes out a big-brimmed fisherman's hat and puts it on: too big. She
      lines it with newspaper, experimenting with the amount until it fits. She puts on his coat,
      gives the sleeves a big cuff. She examines the Colt's dragoon. She drops apples into a
      sack.
      
      She finishes by folding a letter she has written and putting it into an envelope.
      Throughout, we have been hearing its contents in voice-over:
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Dearest Mother. I am about to embark on a great adventure.
                     Or dare I call it a mission, for shall any of us rest easy ere
                     Papa's death is avenged? My investigations in Fort Smith
                     lead me to believe that Tom Chaney can be found and
                     brought to justice, and I have made arrangements to that end.
                     I will return to you once I have seen them properly carried
                     through. . .
      
      
      EXTERIOR BOARDING HOUSE
      
      Mattie is cinching her gear onto Little Blackie. She mounts and rides off as the letter ends:
                                                                                                40
      
                                               Mattie
                     But do not worry on my account. Though I walk through the
                     valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. The
                     author of all things watches over me. And I have a fine
                     horse. Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch Violet's cheek.
                     I am off for the Choctaw Nation.
      
      
      INTERIOR GROCERY
      
      Tracking toward Rooster's rope bed. A hat is pulled down over the face of the figure
      reclining in it. Smoke sifts up from somewhere.
      
      Mattie draws up to the figure with mounting concern. She pulls the hat off. It is the
      elderly Chinese grocer.
      
                                            Mattie
                     Where is Marshal Cogburn!
      
      The grocer reaches a pipe and pulls on it. His manner is dreamy.
      
                                               Grocer
                     Went away. . .
      
                                               Mattie
                     Away! Where?
      
      The grocer pulls an envelope from underneath his robe and hands it to Mattie. He closes
      his eyes and drifts away.
      
      Mattie pulls a scrap of paper from the envelope and reads:
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Here inside is a train ticket for your return home. Use it. By
                     the time you read this I will be across the river in the Indian
                     nation. Pursuit would be futile. I will return with your man
                     Chaney. Leave me to my work. Reuben Cogburn.
      
      Mattie's jaw tightens. She abruptly crumples the paper.
      
      
      RIVER
      
      Mattie gallops down an embankment to a river of some width. At the near-side ferry
                                                                                                  41
      station a raft enclosed by railing waits, its guide rope strung across the river. A pilot
      idles on the near shore.
      
      On the far shore two small figures, mounted, ascend the opposite bank. Mattie draws up in
      front of the ferryman at the edge of the river.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Is that Marshal Cogburn?
      
                                               Ferryman
                     That is the man.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Who's he with?
      
                                               Ferryman
                     I do not know.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Take me across.
      
      He reaches for the reins of her horse.
      
                                              Ferryman
                     So you're the runaway. Marshal told me you'd show up.
                     I'm to present you to the sheriff.
      
                                               Mattie
                     That is a story. Let go my horse. I have business across the
                     river.
      
      The ferryman is leading Little Blackie back up the hill toward the town. Mattie cranes
      around to look at the two small figures across the river. They have twisted in their saddles
      to look back.
      
                     . . . Look Slim, if you don't turn around and take me across
                     you may find yourself in court where you don't want to be. I
                     have a good lawyer.
      
                                               Ferryman
                     Name ain't Slim.
      
      She looks at the dull man's unresponsive back. She twists to look across the river.
      
      The two mounted figures are breaking their look back and resuming their climb up the
                                                                                                   42
      bank.
      
      Mattie draws an apple from the bag slung round the saddlehorn and pegs it, hard as she
      can, at the ferryman.
      
      It hits him square in the back of the head. He reacts, reaching to his head and dropping the
      reins.
      
      Mattie has already leaned forward for the reins and sweeps them back. She saws Little
      Blackie around and sends him galloping for the river.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Run, Little Blackie!
      
                                               Ferryman
                     Hey!
      
      She urges the horse, at the gallop, into the river.
      
      The splashing and shouts have again drawn the attention of the two men across the river.
      
      As the horse goes further into the river its up-and-down gait slows, the water offering
      resistance.
      
      The ferryman has run down to the bank. He stoops for a rock and throws it. It misses by a
      mile.
      
      Little Blackie leaves riverbottom and starts swimming.
      
      The two men across the river, having twisted to look, now rein their horses round to face
      the action. But they do not advance. They rest forearms on pommels and watch.
      
      Little Blackie is being carried downstream as he swims against a swift current.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Good, Little Blackie!
      
      Little Blackie's head dips as he finds his feet again. He slogs laboriously to what is now
      the nearer shore.
      
      The two men up the bank impassively watch.
      
      The horse and Mattie emerge fully from the river, dripping.
      
      Mattie taps heels against Little Blackie's flanks and walks him slowly up the bank. She
                                                                                                  43
      stops many yards short of the two men--Rooster and LeBoeuf.
      
      A silent standoff as Little Blackie breathes heavily. The two expressionless men still have
      not stirred.
      
      At length:
      
                                                 Rooster
                      That's quite a horse.
      
      A long pause.
      
                      . . . I will give you ten dollars for him.
      
                                              Mattie
                      From the money you stole from me?
      
                                               Rooster
                      That was not stolen. I'm out for your man.
      
                                              Mattie
                      I was to accompany you. If I do not, there is no agreement
                      and my money was stolen.
      
      Rooster licks his lips, thinking.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                      Marshal, put this child back on the ferry. We have a long
                      road, and time is a-wasting.
      
                                                    Mattie
                      If I go back, it is to the office of the U.S. marshals to report
                      the theft of my money. And futile, Marshal Cogburn--
                      "Pursuit would be futile"?--is not spelt f-u-d-e-l.
      
      A heavy silence as Cogburn stares at her.
      
      LeBoeuf looks between the two, waiting for Rooster to take action. Gathering that he will
      not, LeBoeuf slides off his horse.
      
      Mattie watches as he walks to Little Blackie, holding up a gentling hand for the horse to
      sniff at and nuzzle.
      
      He abruptly swipes the reins with one hand and with the other grabs Mattie's ankle. He
      pushes momentarily to unstirrup the foot and then pulls hard, tumbling Mattie to the
                                                                                                   44
      ground.
      
                                                  LeBoeuf
                     Little sister, it is time for your spanking.
      
      He begins to spank her.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Help me, Marshal!
      
      Rooster sits impassively on his horse.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                                           (still spanking)
                     Now you do as the grown-ups say! Or I will get myself a
                     birch switch and stripe your leg!
      
      Mattie is struggling and in spite of herself starts to weep. LeBoeuf drags her through the
      dirt to a mesquite bush and snaps off a switch.
      
                                            LeBoeuf
                     Now we will see what tune you sing!
      
      Mattie, wet and filthy, tries vainly to swat back. Rooster still watches without expression
      as LeBoeuf whips the girl.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Are you going to let him do this, Marshal?
      
      Finally, quietly:
      
                                                Rooster
                     No, I don't believe I will. Put your switch away, LeBoeuf.
                     She has got the best of us.
      
      LeBoeuf looks back, for a moment too surprised to speak. He then regains his resolve:
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     She has not got the best of me!
      
      He returns to the beating.
      
                                            Rooster
                                            (evenly)
                     Did you not hear me? That will do, I said.
                                                                                                45
      
                                                LeBoeuf
                     I aim to finish what I started.
      
                                               Rooster
                     That will be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas
                     brush-popper.
      
      The sound of a gun being cocked.
      
      LeBoeuf leaves off the beating to stare at Rooster--whose gun is drawn, cocked, and
      pointed at him.
      
      LeBoeuf flings the switch aside and stalks to his horse. He mutters, but loud enough to be
      heard:
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     Hoorawed by a little girl.
      
      
      CAMPFIRE
      
      Mattie sits looking into the fire, hands clasped around her knees.
      
      LeBoeuf sits feet to the fire, smoking a pipe that, with his boyish face, makes him look as
      if he is playing at professor. He gazes into the fire, musing as he pulls at the pipe.
      
                                                LeBoeuf
                     I am not accustomed to so large a fire. In Texas, we will
                     make do with a fire of little more than twigs or buffalo chips
                     to heat the night's ration of beans.
      
      Rooster enters the circle of light with an armload of wood.
      
                     . . . And, it is Ranger policy never to make your camp in the
                     same place as your cookfire. Very imprudent to make your
                     presence known in unsettled country.
      
      Rooster gazes at LeBoeuf for a beat, then dumps the wood onto the fire.
      
      He leaves the circle of light.
      
      LeBoeuf addresses the darkness that Rooster has disappeared into:
      
                     . . . How do you know that Bagby will have intelligence?
                                                                                                    46
      
                                               Rooster
                     He has a store.
      
      He reenters with a length of rope, and a robe which he unrolls onto the ground.
      
                                            LeBoeuf
                     A store. That makes him an authority on movements in the
                     Territory?
      
      Rooster plays out one end of the rope to just touch the ground, then starts playing out the
      rest as he paces.
      
                                              Rooster
                     We have entered a wild place. Anyone coming in, wanting
                     any kind of supply, cannot pick and choose his portal.
      
      He has finished making a loop around his sleeping robe. Seeing this, LeBoeuf laughs.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     That is a piece of foolishness. All the snakes are asleep this
                     time of year.
      
      As he leaves the circle of light:
      
                                            Rooster
                     They have been known to wake up.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Let me have a rope too.
      
                                            Rooster
                     A snake would not bother you.
      
      He reenters with a bottle and settles down on his robe.
      
                     . . . You are too little and bony. Before you sleep you should
                     fetch water for the morning and put it by the fire. The
                     creek'll ice over tonight.
      
                                               Mattie
                     I am not going down there again. If you want any more
                     water you can fetch it yourself.
                                                                                         47
                                            Rooster
                     Everyone in my party must do his job.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     You are lucky to be traveling in a place where a spring is so
                     handy. In my country you can ride for days and see no
                     ground water. I have lapped filthy water from a hoofprint
                     and was glad to have it.
      
                                               Rooster
                     If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies that says he never
                     drank water from a horse track I think I will shake his hand
                     and give him a Daniel Webster cigar.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     You don't believe it?
      
                                                 Rooster
                     I believed it the first twenty-five times I heard it. Maybe it is
                     true. Maybe lapping water off the ground is Ranger policy.
      
                                                LeBoeuf
                     You are getting ready to show your ignorance now, Cogburn.
                     I don't mind a little personal chaffing but I won't hear
                     anything against the Ranger troop from a man like you.
      
                                            Rooster
                     How long have you boys been mounted on sheep down
                     there?
      
      LeBoeuf leaps angrily to his feet.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     My shaggy horse will be galloping when that big American
                     stud of yours is winded and collapsed. Now make another
                     joke about it. You are only trying to put on a show for this
                     girl Mattie with what you must think is a keen tongue.
      
                                              Rooster
                     This is like women talking.
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     Yes, that is the way! Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.
                                                                                         48
                                                Rooster
                      I think she has got you pretty well figured.
      
      Silence. Crackling fire.
      
                                                Mattie
                      Would you two like to hear the story of "The Midnight
                      Caller"? One of you will have to be "The Caller." I will tell
                      you what to say. I will do all the other parts myself.
      
      LeBoeuf continues to glare at Rooster, breathing heavily.
      
      Rooster, with a loud flap, whips the robe over himself.
      
      
      DAWN
      
      We are close on Mattie's upturned face. Snowflakes are drifting down onto it and
      melting. Mattie's eyes blink open.
      
      Rooster is already at his horse, packing it. LeBoeuf is not in evidence.
      
      Mattie rises.
      
                                                Mattie
                      Good morning, Marshal.
      
                                               Rooster
                                          (eyes on his work)
                      Morning.
      
                                                Mattie
                      Where is Mr. LeBoeuf?
      
      A toss of his head:
      
                                              Rooster
                      Down the hill. Performing his necessaries.
      
                                                Mattie
                      Marshal Cogburn, I welcome the chance for a private parley.
                      I gather that you and Mr. LeBoeuf have come to some sort of
                      agreement. As your employer I believe I have a right to
                      know the particulars.
                                                                                           49
                                               Rooster
                     The particulars is that we bring Chaney in to the magistrate
                     in San Saba Texas where they have a considerable reward on
                     offer. Which we split.
      
                                              Mattie
                     I did not want him brought to Texas, to have Texas
                     punishment administered for a Texas crime. That was not
                     our agreement.
      
      Rooster gives a vicious tug on the cinchrope.
      
                                             Rooster
                     What you want is to have him caught and punished.
      
                                              Mattie
                     I want him to know he is being punished for killing my
                     father.
      
      Rooster turns to her.
      
                                                Rooster
                     You can let him know that. You can tell him to his face.
                     You can spit on him and make him eat sand out of the road.
                     I will hold him down. If you want I will flay the flesh off the
                     soles of his feet and find you an Indian pepper to rub into the
                     wound. Isn't that a hundred dollars' value?
      
                                              Mattie
                     It is not. When I have bought and paid for something I will
                     have my way. Why do you think I am paying you if not to
                     have my way?
      
                                                 Rooster
                     It is time for you to learn you cannot have your way in every
                     little particular. Other people have their interests.
      
      We hear spurs jingling.
      
                     . . . I am a free agent. If you find I fail to satisfy your terms I
                     will return your money at the end of this expedition.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Little Blackie and I are riding back to the U.S. marshals'
                     office. This is fraud.
                                                                                  50
      
                                              Rooster
                   God damn it!
      
      LeBoeuf has appeared.
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                   What's going on?
      
                                            Rooster
                                             (testy)
                   This is a business conversation.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                   Is that what you call it. It sounds to me like you are still
                   being hoorawed by a little girl.
      
                                              Rooster
                   Did you say hooraw!
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                   That was the word.
      
                                              Rooster
                   I will show you hooraw!
      
                                             Mattie
                   There is no hoorawing in it. My agreement with the Marshal
                   antedates yours. It has the force of law.
      
                                            LeBoeuf
                                            (amused)
                   The force of law! This man is a notorious thumper! He rode
                   by the light of the moon with Quantrill and Bloody Bill
                   Anderson!
      
                                           Rooster
                   Those men was patriots, Texas trash!
      
                                        LeBoeuf
                   They murdered women and children in Lawrence, Kansas.
      
                                              Rooster
                   I have heard that too. It is a damned lie! What army was
                   you in, mister?
                                                                                            51
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     I was at Shreveport first with Kirby-Smith--
      
                                              Rooster
                     What side was you on?
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn, and I don't
                     have to hang my head when I say it!
      
                                              Rooster
                     If you had served with Captain Quantrill--
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     Captain Quantrill indeed!
      
                                               Rooster
                     You had best let this go, LeBoeuf!
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     Captain of what!
      
                                             Rooster
                     Good, then! There are not sufficient dollars in the state of
                     Texas to make it worth my while to listen to your opinions,
                     day and night. Our agreement is nullified--it's each man for
                     himself!
      
      LeBoeuf is already mounting his shaggy horse.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     That suits me!
      
      He saws the horse around.
      
                     . . . Congratulations, Cogburn. You have graduated from
                     marauder to wetnurse. Adios!
      
      LeBoeuf gallops off with the thunder of hoofs and the jingle of spurs, and Rooster,
      seething, turns back to his work.
      
      As the hoofbeats recede, Mattie sounds a note of regret:
                                                                                                    52
                                            Mattie
                     We don't need him, do we Marshal?
      
                                              Rooster
                                            (muttering)
                     We'll miss his Sharp's carbine. It's apt to get lively out
                     here.
      
      
      EXTERIOR BAGBY'S STORE
      
      A mule is pulling back on a cotton rope round his neck that is tied off to the porch of the
      ramshackle store. The beast is strangling as the rope is too tight, and he is being poked
      with sticks by two motley-dressed Indian boys up on the porch.
      
      Rooster enters and cuts the rope. The mule brays and canters off, shaking its head, rope
      dangling.
      
                                               Indian Youth
                     Hey.
      
      Rooster is already mounting the steps to the porch.
      
                                                 Rooster
                     Call that sport, do ya?
      
      He kicks the first youth hard in the ass, sending him sprawling off the porch into the dirt.
      The second backs against the railing and Rooster shoves him in the chest so that he flips
      backward to also land in the dirt.
      
                                                Rooster
                     Stay here sister. I will see Bagby.
      
      Mattie, astride Little Blackie, holds the reins of Cogburn's horse. As he disappears inside
      the two youths climb back onto the porch. They sit at the lip, feet dangling, and stare
      sullenly at Mattie. She stares back.
      
      
      MINUTES LATER
      
      The youths have not moved. The door bangs open and Rooster emerges.
      
                                                  Mattie
                     Has Chaney been here?
                                                                                                    53
                                               Rooster
                     No.
      
      Crossing back he kicks one of the boys off the porch into the dirt again. The other youth
      scampers out of footreach. Rooster starts down the stairs.
      
                                            Rooster
                     But Coke Hayes was, two days ago. Coke runs with Lucky
                     Ned. He bought supplies, with this.
      
      With a ching he flips a coin to Mattie. She inspects it: gold, square, with a +-shaped cut-
      out in the middle.
      
                                               Mattie
                     This is Papa's gold piece! Tom Chaney, here we come!
      
                                                Rooster
                     It is not the world's only California gold piece.
      
                                                Mattie
                     They are rare, here.
      
                                                Rooster
                     They are rare. But if it is Chaney's, it could just as easily
                     mean that Lucky Ned and his gang fell upon him, as that he
                     fell in with them. Chaney could be a corpse. These are a
                     rough lot.
      
                                               Mattie
                     That would be a bitter disappointment, Marshal. What do
                     we do?
      
      Rooster mounts up.
      
                                              Rooster
                     We pursue. Ned is unfinished business for the marshals
                     anyhow, and when we have him we will also have Chaney
                     --or we can learn the whereabouts of his body. Bagby
                     doesn't know which way they went, but now we know they
                     come through here, they couldn't be going but one of two
                     ways: north toward the Winding Stair Mountains, or pushing
                     on further west. I suspect north. There is more to rob.
      
      The youth who was kicked into the dirt is dusting himself off. He has been listening
      without interest.
                                                                                     54
      
                                               Youth
                     Mr. Ferrington will want to know who cut loose his mule.
      
      Rooster reins his horse around to go.
      
                                             Rooster
                     Tell him it was Mr. James, a bank examiner from Clay
                     County, Missouri.
      
                                               Youth
                     The James boys is said to be slight, Frank and Jesse both.
      
                                               Rooster
                     One of them has grown fat. The mule will not range far.
                     You boys mend your ways or I will return some dark night
                     and cut off one of your heads--I do not say which--and
                     leave it on the stomach of the other as a warning.
      
      
      RIDING
      
      Rooster and Mattie ride abreast along a barely defined road.
      
                                                  Rooster
                     Potter and I served with him at Elkhorn Tavern. Even
                     latterly our activities was by and large martial. We did
                     though, one time, run across a Yankee paymaster and relieve
                     him of four thousand dollars in gold coin. Squealed like it
                     was his own money. Well, since hostilities was officially
                     ended it was technically criminal so Potter rode down to
                     Arkansas and I went to Cairo Illinois with my share, started
                     calling myself Burroughs and opened an eating place called
                     The Green Frog. I married a grass widow but my drinking
                     picked up and my wife did not like the company of my river
                     friends. She decided to go back to her first husband, a clerk
                     in a hardware store. She said, "Goodbye, Reuben, a love for
                     decency does not abide in you." I told her, "Goodbye, Nola,
                     I hope that little nail-selling bastard will make you happy
                     this time." She took my boy with her too. He never did like
                     me anyhow. I guess I did speak awful rough to him but I did
                     not mean nothing by it. You would not want to see a
                     clumsier child than Horace. I bet he broke forty cups. . .
      
      He frowns and draws up, looking at something. Mattie follows his look.
                                                                                                 55
      
      A man is hanging in a tree--very high, perhaps thirty feet off the ground. The body slowly
      twists. The head seems unnaturally large.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Hey!
      
      At Rooster's shout something separates from the head: we have been looking at not just the
      corpse's silhouette but that of a large carrion-eating bird as well, perched on the corpse's
      shoulder and feeding at the corpse's face. The bird flaps clumsily off.
      
      Rooster gazes at the strung-up body.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Is it Chaney?
      
                                               Mattie
                     I would not recognize the soles of his feet.
      
      Rooster gets off his horse, pulls a knife from his gear, and ambles to the tree. Mattie
      follows.
      
      When she arrives Rooster has started sawing at the rope that ties the body off, wrapped
      around a chest-high branch stump. Mattie looks up.
      
      She is looking mostly at soles of feet as the foreshortened body twists slowly, high above.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Step back now.
      
      She does. Rooster steps back as well as the almost-cut-through rope starts to unravel by
      itself, crazily twisting under the pressure and gently spinning the body above.
      
      The rope snaps. It yanks violently upward, slapping branches.
      
      The body drops--perhaps four feet--and jerks to a stop, jacknifing and dancing.
      
                                               Rooster
                     God damn it.
      
      They both gaze up at the body.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Snagged. Well you are going to have to clamber on up with
                     this knife. I am too old and too fat.
                                                                                                  56
      
      
      UP IN THE TREE
      
      Mattie is well up.
      
      We hear Rooster's voice from below:
      
                                                 Rooster
                     It had one billiard table, served ladies and men both but
                     mostly men. I tried to run it myself a while but I couldn't
                     keep good help and I never did learn how to buy meat. I was
                     like a man fighting bees. Finally I give up and solt it and
                     went out to see the country.
      
      Mattie pauses, looking down.
      
      We are over her. Rooster is foreshortened, a long way down, looking up, smoking a
      cigarette. He reacts to her look down:
      
                                               Rooster
                     You are doing well.
      
      She looks up, down again, and then proceeds. Rooster continues as well:
      
                     . . . That was when I went out to the staked plains of Texas
                     and shot buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe and a Flathead Indian
                     called Olly.
      
      Mattie stretches onto tiptoes, reaches, just gets fingers around a branch. She secures it
      enough with the one hand to dare to reach with the other. She hauls herself up.
      
                     . . . The Mormons had run Shaftoe out of Great Salt Lake
                     City but don't ask me what it was for. Call it a misunder-
                     standing and let it go at that. There is no use in you asking
                     me questions about it, for I will not answer them.
      
      Mattie looks out, at waist-height to the corpse, which twists maybe eight feet away over
      the void. Rooster notes her look:
      
                     . . . Is it our man?
      
      The face is half-eaten and eyeless.
                                                                                             57
                                                Mattie
                     I believe not.
      
      She moves to start back down, but Rooster calls:
      
                                               Rooster
                     No! Cut him down!
      
                                                Mattie
                     Why?
      
                                               Rooster
                     I might know him.
      
      She climbs one more branch to arrive at the hanging branch. She shimmies out onto it and
      pulls the knife from Rooster's belt now around her waist.
      
                     . . . You see, Olly and me both taken a solemn oath to keep
                     silent. Well sir, the big shaggies is about all gone. It is a
                     damned shame.
      
      Mattie looks down, over the shoulder of the close-by foreshortened corpse to the far
      foreshortened Rooster.
      
                     . . . I would give three dollars right now for a pickled buffalo
                     tongue.
      
      She calls out as she starts sawing:
      
                                             Mattie
                     Why did they hang him so high?
      
                                              Rooster
                     I don't know. Possibly in the belief it would make him more
                     dead.
      
      The sawing continues.
      
      Rooster takes one step back.
      
      The rope snaps. At once:
      
      The body drops.
      
      The branch, unburdened, bucks with Mattie atop it.
                                                                                                  58
      
      She gasps, hugging at the branch, getting swung halfway around it but then righting
      herself.
      
      The body hits the ground with a smack.
      
      Mattie looks.
      
      The body is spread out on the ground below, many bones now broken, its posture absurd.
      
      Rooster steps forward. He toes the upper body to get a view of the face. Barely audible:
      
                                                Rooster
                      I do not know this man.
      
      He reacts to something, looking up the road in the direction of their heading.
      
      Mattie looks out. Partly obscured by intervening foliage, an oncoming rider. His pace is
      unhurried.
      
      Down on the ground Rooster turns to face the rider--an Indian with a long-bore rifle
      balanced sideways across the pommel of his saddle. He wears a tattered Union Army
      jacket, crossed bandoliers of rifle shells and a black homburg hat with a feather in its brim.
      
      Rooster drops his hand to his gun as the rider approaches.
      
      Mattie looks down at the foreshortened rider pulling up under the tree. She hears a
      greeting and a mostly inaudible exchange.
      
      After some back-and-forth the Indian dismounts. The men stoop at either end of the
      corpse. Rooster grabs wrists, the Indian, ankles. They lift.
      
      Mattie frowns. She starts to move.
      
      
      A MINUTE LATER
      
      Mattie finishes climbing down.
      
      Rooster is just returning from the road to their two horses by the tree. The Indian, with the
      corpse slung over the rump of his horse, is resuming his trip in the direction from which
      Rooster and Mattie came.
      
                                            Mattie
                      He knew the hanged man?
                                                                                     59
      
      Rooster mounts.
      
                                               Rooster
                     He did not. But it is a dead body, possibly worth something
                     in trade.
      
      He looks up at the sky as snowflakes start to sift down.
      
      
      RIDING
      
      It is snowing lightly. Rooster and Mattie are clomping through a stream.
      
                                               Rooster
                     She had taken a notion she wanted me to be a lawyer.
                     Bought a heavy book called Daniels on Negotiable
                     Instruments and set me to reading it. Never could get a grip
                     on it and I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas.
                     There ain't but about six trees between there and Canada,
                     and nothing else grows but has stickers on it. I went to--
      
      A distant gunshot.
      
      Rooster stops. He twists to look behind.
      
      A listening beat. At length:
      
                                               Rooster
                     I knew it.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Knew what?
      
                                             Rooster
                     We're being followed. I asked the Indian to signal with a
                     shot if there was someone on our trail.
      
                                             Mattie
                     Should we be concerned, Marshal?
      
                                               Rooster
                     No. It's Mr. LeBoeuf, using us as bird dogs in hopes of
                     cutting in once we've flushed the prey. Our Texas friend has
                     got just enough sense to recognize he can't outtrack me.
                                                                                               60
      
      Mattie thinks.
      
                                                  Mattie
                       Perhaps we could double back over our tracks, and confuse
                       the trail in a clever way.
      
                                                Rooster
                       No, we will wait right here and offer our friend a warm
                       hello, and ask him where he is going.
      
      
      MINUTES LATER
      
      Rooster waits, sitting casually astride his horse in the middle of the road. Snow continues
      to fall.
      
      A jingling noise up the road.
      
      Movement: an advancing rider seen through the foliage that masks a bend in the road.
      
      Rooster straightens.
      
      The oncoming rider rounds the bend.
      
      He approaches: a white man with big whiskers, his horse leading a packhorse loaded with
      clinking and jangling sundries. Draped on his own horse's rump is the hanged man's
      body.
      
      The stranger wears a fierce bear head as hat. The rest of the bearskin trails down his body
      as robe.
      
      He advances unhurriedly towards Rooster. At a few yards' distance he draws up, content
      to sit his horse and solemnly return Rooster's stare.
      
      At length:
      
                                                Rooster
                       You are not LeBoeuf.
      
                                              Bear Man
                       My name is Forster. I practice dentistry in the Nation. Also,
                       veterinary arts. And medicine, on those humans that will sit
                       still for it.
                                                                                              61
                                            Rooster
                                      (indicating corpse)
                     You have your work cut out for you there.
      
                                             Bear Man
                     Traded for him with an Indian, who said he came by him
                     honestly. I gave up two dental mirrors and a bottle of
                     expectorant. (beat) Do either of you need medical
                     attention?
      
                                                Rooster
                     No.
      
      Rooster straightens as if to rein his horse around but stops with a thought:
      
                     . . . It is fixing to get cold. Do you know of any place to take
                     shelter?
      
                                              Bear Man
                     I have my bearskin. You might want to head to the Original
                     Greaser Bob's. He notched a dugout into a hollow along the
                     Carrillon River. If you ride the river you won't fail to see it.
                     Greaser Bob--Original Greaser Bob--is hunting north of the
                     picket wire and would not begrudge its use.
      
      A pause.
      
      The Bear Man tilts his head to indicate the corpse behind him.
      
                                              Bear Man
                     I have taken his teeth. I will entertain an offer for the rest of
                     him.
      
      
      NIGHT
      
      A point-of-view looking down on a thrown-together cabin dug into the flanks of a ravine.
      Its roof meets hillside at the rear. Smoke is coming out of a rough chimney.
      
      Rooster and Mattie have paused at the crest of the rise above the dugout to look. Rooster
      shrugs out of his coat.
      
                                                Rooster
                     Take my jacket. Creep onto the roof. If they are not friendly
                     I will give you a sign to damp the chimney.
                                                                                                 62
      
      As Mattie descends to where hillside meets structure Rooster takes his rifle and walks
      around to the front door--crude planking hung on leather-strap hinges. His footsteps
      crunch in the snow.
      
      The door is yanked open, inches, and a backlit face appears over a hand holding a revolver.
      Rooster halts.
      
                                                  Man
                     Who is out there?
      
                                              Rooster
                     We are looking for shelter.
      
                                              Man
                     No room for you here! Ride on!
      
      The door slams.
      
      After a moment the light inside goes out.
      
      Mattie, arriving on the roof, looks steeply down on Rooster. He glances up, thinking. He
      does not sign. He looks back at the door.
      
                                                Rooster
                     Who all is in there?
      
                                                  Voice
                     Ride on!
      
      Rooster looks up at Mattie. He nods.
      
      She balls the jacket and stuffs it into the chimney.
      
      Rooster takes ten paces to one side of the door and then kneels in the snow, raising his
      rifle.
      
      Long beat.
      
      Muffled coughs from inside the house--more than one person.
      
      Activity inside--yelling--the hiss of fire being doused. Suddenly:
      
      The door flies open and--BANG! BANG!--two shotgun blasts.
                                                                                             63
      Slightest beat as Mattie peers into the yard, and then--BANG!--shot rips through the
      roof just at her feet.
      
      A rifle blast--from Rooster. A yelp of pain from inside.
      
                                                Rooster
                       I am a Federal officer! Who is in there? Speak up and be
                       quick about it.
      
                                             New Voice
                       A Methodist and a son-of-a-bitch!
      
      Rooster cocks his head.
      
                                                  Rooster
                       Is that Emmett Quincy?
      
                                           New Voice
                       I don't know any Emmett Quincy.
      
                                               Rooster
                       Listen here, Emmett Quincy. I know it is you! This is
                       Rooster Cogburn. Columbus Potter and five other marshals
                       is out here with me. We have got a bucket of coal oil. In
                       one minute we will burn you out from both ends! Chuck
                       your arms clear and come out with your hands locked on
                       your head and you will not be harmed. Oncet that coal oil
                       goes down the chimney we are killing everything that comes
                       out the door!
      
      Thinking beat.
      
                                                  Quincy
                       There's only two of you!
      
                                              Rooster
                       You go ahead and bet your life on it! How many of you is in
                       there?
      
                                               Quincy
                       Me and Moon, but he is hit! He can't walk!
      
                                               Rooster
                       Drag him out! Light that lamp!
                                                                                                  64
      Thinking beat.
      
                                                 Quincy
                       Tell them other officers to be careful with their guns! We
                       are coming out!
      
      The door opens again. From the smoky black a shotgun and two revolvers are tossed out.
      Then, orange light: a lamp is lit. Two men emerge, one limping and holding onto the
      other, who holds high the lamp.
      
                                               Rooster
                       Down in the snow! Lie still while I cuff you! We is only
                       two, but my man on the roof will shoot you if you get feisty.
      
      
      INSIDE
      
      Rooster has coaxed the fire back to life. He peers into the large pot hanging over it.
      
      The cuffed men sit side-by-side on a plank bench behind a plank table, staring at Mattie.
      Moon's leg is bound with a large blue handkerchief.
      
      Quincy sounds resentful:
      
                                               Quincy
                       You said it was a man on the roof. I thought it was Potter.
      
                                             Rooster
                       You was always dumb, Quincy, and remain true to form.
      
      He stirs the pot with a wooden spoon.
      
                       . . .This here's an awful lot of sofky. Was you boys looking
                       for company?
      
                                                Quincy
                       That is our supper and breakfast both. I like a big breakfast.
      
      Moon nods agreement, but has a different thought:
      
                                               Moon
                       Sofky always cooks up bigger than you think.
      
      Rooster, continuing to nose around, pushes the canvas cover off a crate of bottles.
                                                                                      65
                                              Rooster
                     And a good store of whiskey as well. What are you boys up
                     to, outside of cooking banquets? You are way too jumpy.
      
                                            Quincy
                     We didn't know who was out there weather like this. It
                     might have been some crazy man. Anyone can say he is a
                     marshal.
      
                                                Moon
                     My leg hurts.
      
                                                Rooster
                     I'll bet it does. When is the last time you seen your old pard
                     Ned Pepper?
      
                                            Quincy
                     Ned Pepper? I don't know him. Who is he?
      
      Rooster spoons sofky from the pot into a bowl
      
                                              Rooster
                     I'm surprised you don't remember him. He is a little fellow,
                     nervous and quick. His lip is all messed up.
      
                                             Quincy
                     That don't bring anybody to mind.
      
      Rooster sits across from the men with his bowlful of sofky and starts eating.
      
                                              Rooster
                     There is a new boy that might be running with Ned. He is
                     short himself and he has got a powder mark on his face, a
                     black place. He calls himself Chaney, or Chelmsford
                     sometimes. Carries a Henry rifle.
      
                                             Quincy
                     That don't bring anybody to mind. Black mark, I would
                     remember that.
      
                                            Rooster
                     You don't remember anything I want to know, do you
                     Quincy? I hope you don't mind. . .
      
      Raises a spoonful.
                                                                                     66
      
                    . . . There seems to be ample. What do you know, Moon?
      
      Moon looks at Quincy, who gives a hard look back.
      
                                             Moon
                    I don't know those boys. I always try to help out the law.
      
                                              Rooster
                    By the time we get back to Fort Smith that leg will be
                    swelled up tight as Dick's hatband. It will be mortified and
                    they will cut it off. Then if you live I will get you two or
                    three years in the Federal house up in Detroit.
      
                                              Moon
                    You are trying to get at me.
      
                                             Rooster
                    They will teach you to read and write up there but the rest of
                    it won't be so good. Them boys can be hard on a gimp.
      
                                              Moon
                    You are trying to get at me.
      
                                             Rooster
                    You give me some good information on Ned and I will take
                    you to McAlester's store tomorrow get that ball taken out of
                    your leg. Then I will give you three days to clear the
                    Territory.
      
                                           Quincy
                    We don't know those boys you are looking for.
      
      Rooster shrugs at Moon.
      
                                             Rooster
                    It ain't his leg.
      
                                             Quincy
                    Don't go to flapping your mouth, Moon. It is best to let me
                    do the talking.
      
                                                 Moon
                    I would say if I knew. . .
                                                                                    67
                                                 Quincy
                     We are weary trappers.
      
      He reacts to Mattie, staring at him.
      
                     . . . Who worked you over with the ugly stick?
      
      Mattie's look shifts to Moon.
      
                                               Mattie
                     The man Chaney with the marked face killed my father. He
                     was a whiskey drinker like you and it led to killing in the
                     end. If you answer the marshal's questions he will help you.
                     I have a good lawyer at home and he will help you too.
      
      Beat.
      
                                               Moon
                     I am puzzled by this. (to Rooster) Why is she here?
      
                                             Quincy
                     Don't go jawing with these people, Moon. Don't go jawing
                     with that runt.
      
                                                Mattie
                                             (to Quincy)
                     I don't like you. I hope you go to jail. My lawyer will not
                     help you.
      
                                                 Moon
                     My leg is giving me fits.
      
                                              Rooster
                     Yes, a young fellow like you don't want to loose his leg.
                     You are too young to be getting about on a willow peg. You
                     love dancing and sport, carrying on.
      
                                              Quincy
                     Easy now. He is trying to get at you.
      
                                               Rooster
                     I am getting at you with the truth.
      
                                            Moon
                     We seen Ned and Haze two days ago. We's supposed--
                                                                                                    68
      
                                               Quincy
                     Don't act the fool! If you blow I will kill you!
      
                                              Moon
                     I am played out. I must have a doctor. We's supposed--
      
      Quincy jerks up one knee, banging the bottom of the table and sloshing Rooster's sofky as
      he grabs something from his boot: a knife.
      
      He slams it down on Moon's cuffed hand, chopping off four fingers. They fly like chips
      from a log.
      
      As Moon screams Rooster mutters:
      
                                               Rooster
                     God damn it!
      
      Quincy flips the knife lightly in the air and regrabs it with blade pointing opposite-wise.
      He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into Moon's chest.
      
      Rooster has his gun out now and fires.
      
      Quincy jerks back, hit in the face. Blood spatters Mattie. Quincy, still seated, slides
      awkwardly down the wall.
      
      Moon has fallen to the floor, knife in chest.
      
                                                Moon
                     Oh lord, I am dying!
      
      Rooster and Mattie stand over him.
      
                     . . . Do something! Help me!
      
                                               Rooster
                     I can do nothing for you, son. Your pard has killed you and I
                     have done for him.
      
                                              Moon
                     Don't leave me lying here! Don't let the wolves rip me up!
      
                                                Rooster
                     I'll see you are buried right. You tell me about Ned. Where
                     did you see him?
                                                                                              69
      
                                                Moon
                     Two days ago at McAlester's store. They are coming here
                     tonight to get remounts, and sofky. They just robbed the
                     Katy Flyer at Wagoner's Switch if the snow didn't stop 'em.
      
      Eyes wide, he gazes down his body.
      
                     . . . I am bleeding buckets! I am gone. Send the news to my
                     brother, George Garrett. He is a Methodist circuit rider in
                     South Texas. You can write care of the district supervisor in
                     Austin.
      
                                              Rooster
                     Should I tell him you was outlawed up?
      
                                                 Moon
                     It don't matter, he knows I am on the scout. I will meet him
                     later walking the streets of Glory!
      
                                             Rooster
                     Don't be looking for Quincy.
      
      
      OUTSIDE
      
      Mattie's point-of-view: the dark shoulders of the wooded hills, funneling down to the
      ravine. It is all very still except for falling snow.
      
      Mattie stands outside the cabin door, hugging herself, keeping watch.
      
      The door opens and Rooster emerges.
      
                                             Rooster
                     Hobble our mounts in the corral out back. We don't know
                     when they's coming.
      
      From the threshold he surveys the inside of the cabin.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Is he dead?
      
                                              Rooster
                     He is. I stowed the bodies under the blanket there. Just
                     needs to look right enough to get 'em in the door.
                                                                                             70
      
      Something he sees inside prompts Rooster to quickly reenter the cabin. He reemerges, fist
      closed on something.
      
                     . . . We'll climb that ridge there, fort up somewhere gives us
                     a clear shot.
      
      He flings, and whatever he was holding lands faintly pit-a-pat in the woods.
      
                                                Mattie
                     What was that?
      
                                               Rooster
                     Fingers.
      
      
      RIDGE
      
      Rooster finishes hunkering down.
      
      He takes out his revolver and put a cartridge into the one empty chamber, under the
      hammer. He places the revolver on a log and puts the sack of cartridges next to the
      revolver. He leans his rifle against the log. He looks out.
      
      His point-of-view of the cabin below, peaceful, smoke drifting from the chimney.
      
                                                Mattie
                     What do we do now?
      
      Rooster takes out a sack of corn dodgers and starts to eat.
      
                                                Rooster
                     We wait. They ride up, what we want is to get them all in
                     the dugout. I will kill the last one to go in and then we will
                     have them in a barrel.
      
                                               Mattie
                     You will shoot him in the back?
      
                                                Rooster
                     It will give them to know our intentions is serious. Then I
                     will call down and see if they will be taken alive. If they
                     won't I will shoot them as they come out. I am hopeful that
                     three of their party being dead will take the starch out of
                     them.
                                                                                       71
      
      Chewing beat.
      
                                                 Mattie
                      You display great poise.
      
                                                 Rooster
                      It is just a turkey shoot. There was one time in New Mexico,
                      when Bo was a strong colt and I myself had less tarnish, we
                      was being pursued by seven men. I turned Bo around and
                      taken the reins in my teeth and rode right at them boys firing
                      them two navy sixes I carry on my saddle. Well I guess they
                      was all married men who loved their families as they
                      scattered and run for home.
      
                                                 Mattie
                      That is hard to believe.
      
                                                 Rooster
                      What is?
      
                                                 Mattie
                      One man riding at seven.
      
                                                 Rooster
                      It is true enough. You go for a man hard enough and fast
                      enough and he don't have time to think about how many is
                      with him--he thinks about himself and how he may get clear
                      of the wrath that is about to set down on him.
      
                                              Mattie
                      Why were they pursuing you?
      
                                               Rooster
                      They was in the nature of a posse.
      
                                              Mattie
                      You were particeps criminis in something other than the case
                      of the Yankee paymaster?
      
                                                Rooster
                      I robbed a high-interest bank. You can't rob a thief, can
                      you? I never robbed a citizen. Never took a man's watch.
                                                                                              72
                                                  Mattie
                     It is all stealing.
      
                                                Rooster
                     That is the position they took in New Mexico.
      
      He is suddenly alert, and raises a hand for quiet.
      
      There is the sound of a rider, approaching slowly.
      
      Rooster is puzzled:
      
                     . . . One man. I didn't figure them to send a scout.
      
      Their high point-of-view: a mounted figure has entered the ravine.
      
      He travels its length and stops his horse before the cabin and dismounts. We hear the
      jingle of spurs.
      
                     . . . Damn. It is LeBoeuf.
      
      Distant, calling toward the cabin:
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     Hello?
      
      LeBoeuf unholsters a gun. He walks to the cabin, opens the door and peers in.
      
      Rooster starts to rise, about to call out, as LeBoeuf enters and closes the door.
      
      We hear hoofbeats. Many horses.
      
                                            Mattie
                     We have to warn him, Marshal!
      
      Rooster is looking to the mouth of the ravine.
      
                                                Rooster
                     Too late.
      
      Mattie follows his look.
      
      Their high point-of-view: four riders just entering the ravine.
      
      They look back to the cabin.
                                                                                              73
      
      From inside, faintly:
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     Oh!
      
      The door opens and LeBoeuf stumbles out, wide-eyed.
      
      He sees the approaching riders. They see him.
      
      They slow, approaching with caution.
      
      LeBoeuf looks at them, glances back over his shoulder, looks forward again.
      
                                                Mattie
                     What do we do, Marshal?
      
                                            Rooster
                     We sit. What does he do?
      
      The riders stop several paces from LeBoeuf. They spread in a line facing him. Words are
      exchanged; we cannot make them out.
      
      LeBoeuf unholsters a gun and points it at the four men.
      
                                                Rooster
                     He is a fine one for not drawing attention to himself.
      
      The four men, slouched astride their horses, are not impressed by LeBoeuf's gun. There is
      more talking.
      
                                             Rooster
                     Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned.
      
      He refers to the mounted man who does most of the talking. Lucky Ned now speaks to the
      men on either side and the two corners advance, closing a circle around LeBoeuf.
      
      LeBoeuf looks warily from side side, swinging his gun to cover the group. None of the
      riders bothers to unholster a gun.
      
      The man to LeBoeuf's right lifts a rope off his saddle and casually twirls it.
      
      The man to his left says something: LeBoeuf looks left and the man to his right drops the
      rope around LeBoeuf and pulls it tight. LeBoeuf is jerked off his feet, gun dropping. The
      mounted man backs his horse, taking the play from the rope. He dallies the free end round
                                                                                                 74
      his saddlehorn.
      
      Two of the men slide off their horses.
      
      One of them heads for the cabin door.
      
                                                Rooster
                     Well, that's that.
      
      BANG!--the rifleshot, just at Mattie's ear, is deafening.
      
      The man heading to the cabin drops, shot in the back.
      
      The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked.
      
      The horse towing LeBoeuf also skitters, spooked, as its rider looks wildly about and starts
      shooting.
      
      Lucky Ned looks toward our vantage point and also begins firing.
      
      Rooster is methodically aiming and firing but in the commotion below his first couple of
      shots don't tell. His third drops Lucky Ned's horse.
      
      The other unmounted man is frantically trying to snatch up the reins of one of the loose
      horses.
      
      The man towing LeBoeuf spurs his horse toward one of the free horses, trying to grab it.
      LeBoeuf is dragged past plunging horses' hooves.
      
      A cacaphony of screaming horses, crackling gunfire from the basin, and the boom of
      Rooster's rifle.
      
      The unmounted man has managed to grab a halter. He climbs with difficulty aboard the
      skittish horse.
      
      The rider towing LeBoeuf cuts loose the towline. He gallops toward Ned Pepper with an
      arm outstretched to help him aboard.
      
      Rooster is tracking him with his rifle.
      
      Lucky Ned grabs the extended arm. As he begins to swing up there is the BOOM of
      Rooster's rifle. The rider pitches off the horse but Lucky Ned manages to stay on, and
      swipes up the reins. He gallops off.
      
      The one other surviving horseman follows him.
                                                                                               75
      
      There is one dead horse in the basin, a live unmounted horse racing crazy circles, and three
      still bodies. One is LeBoeuf's.
      
      Rooster rises.
      
                                                   Rooster
                       Well that didn't pan out.
      
      
      IN THE BASIN
      
      LeBoeuf is moaning.
      
      Rooster walks toward him trailed by Mattie, glancing along the way at the two dead men.
      
                                               Rooster
                       You managed to put a kink in my rope, pardner.
      
                                                   LeBoeuf
                       I am theverely injured.
      
      Something is wrong with LeBoeuf's speech. Bloody saliva bubbles copiously from his
      mouth.
      
                                                   Rooster
                       Yes you got drug some.
      
                                                   LeBoeuf
                       Altho shshot. By a rifle.
      
      Rooster stoops to examine.
      
                                                 Rooster
                       That is quite possible. The scheme did not develop as I had
                       planned. You have been shot in the shoulder but the ball
                       passed through. It will pain you in the years to come. What
                       happened to your mouth?
      
                                                   LeBoeuf
                       I believe I beh mythelf.
      
      Rooster slaps lightly down at LeBoeuf's chin, signaling that he should open up.
      
      LeBoeuf does, and Rooster digs in with two dirty fingers, dipping his head to peer in as he
                                                                                             76
      pokes this way and that.
      
                                             Rooster
                    Couple of teeth missing and yes, the tongue is bit almost
                    through. Do you want to see if it will knit or should I just
                    yank it free? I know a teamster who bit his tongue off being
                    thrown from a horse. After a time he learned to make
                    himself more or less understood.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                    Hngnickh.
      
      Bloody saliva bubbles out with the word. Rooster withdraws his fingers.
      
                                               Rooster
                    What's that now?
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                    Knit.
      
                                              Rooster
                    Very well. It is impossible to bind a tongue wound. The
                    shoulder we will kit out.
      
      Mattie goes to inspect the two outlaws' corpses as Rooster pokes back LeBoeuf's shirt to
      look at the wound.
      
                    . . . It's too bad. We just ran across a doctor of sorts but I do
                    not know where he was headed.
      
                                            LeBoeuf
                    I thaw him too. Ith how I came to be here.
      
                                             Mattie
                    Neither of these men are Chaney, Marshal.
      
                                               Rooster
                    I know it. I know them both. The ugly one is Coke Hayes.
                    Him uglier still is Clement Parmalee. Parmalee and his
                    brothers have a silver claim in the Winding Stair Mountains
                    and I will bet you that's where Lucky Ned's gang is waiting.
                    We'll sleep here, follow in the morning.
      
                                            Mattie
                    We promised to bury the poor soul inside.
                                                                                                     77
      
                                              Rooster
                     Ground is too hard. If these men wanted a decent burial they
                     should have got themselves kilt in summer.
      
      
      SNOW
      
      Falling straight down: a windless night.
      
      We hear a murmuring male voice from inside the cabin.
      
      Mattie is finishing rubbing down her horse.
      
                                                Mattie
                     Sleep well, Little Blackie. . .
      
      She puts up the brush and pulls an apple from her apple bag.
      
                     . . . I have a notion that tomorrow we will reach our object.
                     We are "hot on the trail". . .
      
      The horse chomps up the apple and she rubs its muzzle as it chews.
      
                     . . . It seems that we will overtake Tom Chaney in the
                     Winding Stair Mountains. I would not want to be in his
                     shoes.
      
      The horse huffs and blows.
      
      
      FRONT OF THE CABIN
      
      We are raking the four dead men who have been carelessly propped against the outside
      wall to sit in an irregular row. Mattie passes them, with a brief look, and opens the door,
      and the murmuring voice from inside fans up louder.
      
      
      INSIDE
      
      As Mattie enters. We see LeBoeuf musing before the fire as he cleans his Sharp's carbine
      --an awkward operation given the injury to his shoulder, now bandaged.
      
      All we see of Rooster, seated further from the fire, is a pair of boots, and legs stretching
      into darkness.
                                                                                               78
      
      Mattie goes to the pot of food on the fire.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     Azh I understand it, Chaney--or Chelmzhford, azh he called
                     himshelf in Texas--shot the shenator'zh dog. When the
                     shenator remonshtrated Chelmzhford shot him azh well.
                     You could argue that the shooting of the dog wazh merely an
                     inshtansh of malum prohibitum, but the shooting of a
                     shenator izh indubitably an inshtansh of malum in shay.
      
      Rooster is a voice in the darkness:
      
                                                Rooster
                     Malla-men what?
      
                                                  Mattie
                     Malum in se. The distinction is between an act that is wrong
                     in itself, and an act that is wrong only according to our laws
                     and mores. It is Latin.
      
      We hear the pthoonk of a bottle yielding its cork, followed by the pthwa of the cork's
      being spit out.
      
                                              Rooster
                     I am struck that LeBoeuf is shot, trampled, and nearly severs
                     his tongue and not only does not cease to talk but spills the
                     banks of English.
      
      We hear liquid slosh as the bottle is tipped back.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                                              (placidly)
                     I wuzh within three hundred yardzh of Chelmzhford once.
                     The closhesht I have been. With the Sharp'sh carbine, that
                     izh within range. But I wuzh mounted, and had the choish of
                     firing off-hand, or dishmounting to shoot from resht--which
                     would allow Chelmzhford to augment the dishtansh. I fired
                     mounted--and fired wide.
      
      We hear the smack of lips releasing bottleneck, and a wet breath.
      
                                                Rooster
                     . . . You could not hit a man at three hundred yards if the gun
                     was resting on Gibraltar.
                                                                                                79
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     The Sharp'sh carbine izh an inshtrument of uncanny power
                     and precizhun.
      
                                               Rooster
                     I have no doubt that the gun is sound.
      
      Silence.
      
      LeBoeuf shrugs.
      
      
      MORNING
      
      Wide: three riders leave the cabin single-file.
      
      Jump in: pushing Mattie, who rides last in line. LeBoeuf is in front of her. Rooster leads,
      head tipping momentarily back to swig from a bottle.
      
      He then half-hums, half-scats a tune.
      
      Mattie twists to look behind.
      
      Her point-of-view: pulling away from the cabin, against the wall of which the four dead
      men are now semi-drifted over with snow. Rooster's humming has stopped and we hear
      his voice:
      
                                               Rooster
                     That was "Johnny in the Low Ground." There are very few
                     fiddle tunes I have not heard. Once heard they are locked in
                     my mind forever. It is a sadness to me that I have sausage
                     fingers that cannot crowd onto a fretboard--little fat girls at
                     a cotillion. "Soldier's Joy"!
      
      He launches into another song, interrupted by the slosh of liquid as he takes a drink.
      Mattie looks forward again and LeBoeuf turns to look back at her. He keeps his voice low:
      
                                                  LeBoeuf
                     I don't believe he shlept.
      
      Still without looking back, Rooster projects:
      
                                               Rooster
                     Fort Smith is a healthy distance, LeBoeuf, but I would
                                                                                                  80
                     encourage the creature you ride to try to make it in a day. Out here a
                     one-armed man looks like easy prey.
      
                                            LeBoeuf
                     And a one-eyed man--who can't shshoodt? Why don't you
                     tshurn back, Khoghburn?
      
                                               Rooster
                     I will do fine.
      
      He twists around to gaily hector LeBoeuf:
      
                     . . . I know where the Parmalee's claim is. I am uninjured, I
                     am provisioned--and we agreed to separate.
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     In conscschiensh you cannot shite our agreement. You are
                     the pershon who shshot me.
      
                                              Mattie
                     Mr. LeBoeuf has a point, Marshal. It is an unfair leg-up in
                     any competition to shoot your opposite number.
      
                                             Rooster
                     God damn it! I don't accept it as a given that I did shoot
                     LeBoeuf. There was plenty of guns going off.
      
                                                LeBoeuf
                     I heard a rifle and felt the ball. You mishshed your shshodt,
                     Khoghburn, admit it. You are more handicapped without the
                     eye than I without the arm.
      
                                             Rooster
                     Missed my shot! I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards!
      
      He reins his horse up, hastily tips the bottle to his mouth to make sure it is empty, and then
      hurls it high.
      
      He pulls out a navy six-gun and fires.
      
      The bottle reaches the height of its arc untouched, and drops.
      
      Rooster cocks his head at the landed bottle several paces distant. He shoots again and
      misses.
                                                                                                81
      He shoots a third time and the bottle shatters.
      
                                             Rooster
                     The chinaman is running them cheap shells on me again.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     I tdhought you were going to shay the shun was in your
                     eyezh. That izh to shay, your eye.
      
      Rooster starts to dismount, finishing in a semi-controlled fall. He dusts one knee and
      reaches into his saddlebag. He pulls out a corn dodger and heaves it up.
      
      He fires. The corn dodger is obliterated.
      
      He reaches two corn dodgers from the saddlebag.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Two at one time!
      
      He hurls them and quickly fires twice. Nothing happens; he quickly fires three times at the
      falling corn dodgers, missing.
      
      Scowling, he throws a single corn dodger and is just raising his gun when another gun goes
      off, making him jump.
      
      LeBoeuf has fired with a gun in his left hand, missing.
      
                                             Rooster
                     I will chunk one high. Hold fire.
      
      He reaches into the saddlebag and hurls it high. Both he and Leboeuf fire. It explodes.
      
                                               LeBoeuf
                     There.
      
                                               Rooster
                     There?! My bullet!
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     Your bullet? If you hit what you aim at, eckshplain my
                     shoulder!
      
                                                Mattie
                     Gentlemen, shooting cornbread out here on the prairie is
                     getting us no closer to the Ned Pepper gang.
                                                                                                  82
      
                                                Rooster
                       One more, this will prove it. Hold fire!
      
      He tosses a corn dodger and fires. It holds to its arc and falls. LeBoeuf is smug.
      
                                                LeBoeuf
                       Azh I shed, Khoghburn.
      
      Rooster roars:
      
                                                Rooster
                       Did you not see the piece fly off?!
      
      
      RIDING
      
      Some time later.
      
      Rooster sways in the saddle, holding a bottle, humming.
      
      He tips his head up and tilts the bottle all the way back, confirming that this one too is now
      empty.
      
      Riding forward, he leans out of the saddle, stretching low to one side, his hand extended
      with the bottle. Wavering, he places it upon a large rock as he passes.
      
      His arm waves for balance as he straightens but he keeps his place on the horse. He half-
      turns, propping himself with one hand on his saddle-back, to address Mattie and LeBoeuf:
      
                                                Rooster
                       Find our way back!
      
      
      SKY
      
      Framed by a mine entrance.
      
      Rooster steps into the square, wood-beam frame of the entrance, looking in.
      
      A beat, and he pulls out his six-gun and fires in.
      
      Echoing ricochets.
      
      Wide outside: Rooster before the entrance; Mattie and LeBoeuf standing close by. Very
                                                                                                  83
      still.
      
      The little camp is deserted.
      
      Rooster turns to pan the hills.
      
      At length:
      
                                                Rooster
                       Lucky Ned!
      
      Very faint echo.
      
      Faintly, from our distant perspective:
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                       Very good, Khoghburn. Now what.
      
      
      CRACKLING CAMPFIRE
      
      It is raining.
      
      The campfire is roughly canopied by a hide draped at a cant over a pair of tree branches.
      
      Mattie pours hot water from a kettle into a large tin cup holding a corn dodger. She takes a
      fork and starts mashing the dodger into mush.
      
      LeBoeuf sits before the fire, coat over his head, one hand on his jaw, which is swollen.
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                       Cogburn does not want me eating out of his store.
      
                                                 Mattie
                       That is silly. You have not eaten the whole day, and it is my
                       store not his.
      
                                                Rooster
                       Let him starve!
      
      Rooster, bellicose, stumbles to the fire with a few thin branches. As he leans in toward the
      fire the water draining off the low edge of the canopy drums onto his neck. He waves a
      hand back at it like a man swatting flies.
                                                                                                84
                                             Rooster
                     He does not track! He does not shoot--except at foodstuffs!--
      
                                                  LeBoeuf
                     That wazh your idea.
      
                                             Rooster
                     --He does not contribute! He is a millstone, with opinions!
                     He is a man who walks in front of bullets!
      
      Rooster sits heavily, a stretching leg kicking away an empty bottle. Rain patters on his hat.
      
                     . . . He is a drag-brake for horses!
      
                                             Mattie
                     Mr. LeBoeuf drew single-handed upon the Lucky Ned
                     Pepper Gang while we fired safely from cover, like a band of
                     sly Injuns!
      
                                                  Rooster
                     We?
      
                                                 Mattie
                     It is unfair to indict a man when his jaw is swollen and
                     tongue mangled and who is therefore unable to rise to his
                     own defense!
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     I can thpeak for mythelf. I am hardly obliged to anther the
                     ravingth of a drunkard. It ith beneath me.
      
      He rises and starts gathering his things.
      
                     . . . I shall make my own camp elthwhere. It ith you who
                     have nothing to offer, Khoghburn. A shad picture indeed.
                     Thish izh no longer a manhunt, it izh a debauch. The Texath
                     Ranger preththeth on alone.
      
                                                  Rooster
                     Take the girl! I bow out!
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     A fine thing to deshide once you have brought her into the
                     middle of the Choctaw Nation.
                                                                                               85
                                            Rooster
                     I bow out! I wash my hands!
      
                                             Mattie
                     Gentlemen, we cannot fall out in this fashion, so close to our
                     goal, with Tom Chaney nearly in hand!
      
      Rooster erupts:
      
                                                Rooster
                     In hand?! If he is not in a shallow grave, somewhere
                     between here and Fort Smith, he is gone! Long gone!
                     Thanks to Mr. LeBoeuf, we missed our shot! We have
                     barked, and the birds have flown! Gone gone gone! Lucky
                     Ned and his cohort, gone! Your fifty dollars, gone! Gone
                     the whiskey seized in evidence! The trail is cold, if ever
                     there was one! I am a foolish old man who has been drawn
                     into a wild goose chase by a harpy in trousers--and a
                     nincompoop! Well, Mr. LeBoeuf can wander the Choctaw
                     Nation for as long as he likes; perhaps the local Indians will
                     take him in and honor his gibberings by making him Chief!
                     You, sister, may go where you like! I return home! Our
                     engagement is terminated! I bow out!
      
      He whips his robe over himself.
      
      
      MINUTES LATER
      
      Wide on Mattie, staggering toward us carrying a saddle. We boom down to bring Little
      Blackie into the foreground as Mattie takes the last few stumbling steps forward, almost at
      a run so as to let her inertia help her heave the saddle up onto the horse's back.
      
                                               Mattie
                     I am going with you.
      
      LeBoeuf, cinching a saddle onto his woolly horse, looks around.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     Oh, that izh not poshible.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Have I held you back? I have a Colt's dragoon revolver
                     which I know how to use, and I would be no more of a
                     burden to you than I was to the marshal.
                                                                                              86
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     That izh not my worry. You have earned your shpurzh, that
                     izh clear enough--you have been a regular "old hand" on the
                     trail. But Cogburn izh right, even if I would not give him the
                     shatishfaction of consheding it. The trail izh cold, and I am
                     conshiderably diminished.
      
                                              Mattie
                     How can you give up now, after the many months you've
                     dedicated to finding Chaney? You have shown great
                     determination. I misjudged you. I picked the wrong man.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     I would go on in your company if there were clear way to go.
                     But we would be shtriking out blindly. Chelmshford izh
                     gone--we have chaished him right off the map. There izh
                     nothing for it. I am bound for Texash, and it izh time for you
                     to go home too.
      
      He swings himself up onto the horse.
      
                     . . . The marshal, when he shoberzh, izh your way back.
      
                                              Mattie
                     I will not go back. Not without Chaney, dead or alive.
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     I misjudged you as well. I eckshtend my hand.
      
      He does, dropping a hand gloved in rough suede. She refuses to take it.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Mr. LeBoeuf! Please!
      
      He remains with hand extended. She hesitates, sees there is no give, and reaches for up for
      the hand. They shake.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     Adiosh!
      
      He saws the horse around and sets it to a prancing walk, his spurs jingling.
      
      The sound recedes, leaving behind Rooster's snoring from the campfire.
                                                                                                  87
      
      CAMPFIRE
      
      Rooster's snores bump up at the cut.
      
      Mattie enters, gazes down for a thinking beat at the passed-out lawman, then lies down on
      her robe.
      
      She lies still, gazing up.
      
      After a long beat she abruptly rises.
      
      She recedes toward the horses. As she reaches them we hear Little Blackie snort and blow.
      
      Mattie returns with a length of coiled rope. She plays it out in a loop around her robe. She
      lies down again. She closes her eyes.
      
      Fade out.
      
      
      EARY MORNING
      
      We are high and close on Rooster, asleep. Face mottled red, he looks like hell. He emits a
      symphony of respiratory noises as breath fights through layers of phlegm.
      
      Reverse on Mattie, looking down at him.
      
      Wider on the forlorn campsite--Mattie standing, Rooster awkwardly sprawled sleeping,
      LeBoeuf gone.
      
      Close on a bucket: Mattie's hand enters to grab it.
      
      
      EMBANKMENT
      
      We hear rushing water.
      
      Mattie descends, carefully stiff-legged, down a steep slope thick with trees and brush.
      
      She emerges onto the bank of a fast-flowing stream, shallow at this point and loud.
      
      Mattie takes a couple of steps into the water to dip the bucket. Soft, behind her, we see
      four horses watering at the opposite bank, just downstream.
      
      Mattie stoops to fill the bucket. Turning as she straightens, she sees the four horses.
                                                                                                  88
      
      Surprised, she drops the bucket and stares.
      
      The horses huff and blow in the water. They are not wild--they wear tack--but there is no
      rider in sight, until:
      
      A man straightens and emerges from behind one of the horses. The first thing we notice
      about him is the silhouette of the rifle projecting over one shoulder, slung to the man's
      back with a piece of sash cord.
      
      He looks at something floating by in the stream: Mattie's bucket. He looks up. We jump
      closer:
      
      The man has a black mark on his forehead.
      
      Seeing Mattie, who still gapes at him, he hastily swings his rifle round and trains it on her.
      He takes cautious, splashing steps forward.
      
                                             Chaney
                     Well now I know you. Your name is Mattie. You are little
                     Mattie the bookkeeper. Isn't this something.
      
      He grins, relaxing. He slings the rifle back over his shoulder.
      
                                             Mattie
                     Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.
      
                                             Chaney
                     What are you doing here?
      
                                                Mattie
                     I came to fetch water.
      
      Mattie pulls the flour sack from her coat pocket and works carefully at the cord that
      cinches it shut. Chaney watches.
      
                                             Chaney
                     I mean what are you doing here in these mountains?
      
                                               Mattie
                     I have not been formally deputized but I am acting as an
                     agent for Marshal Reuben Cogburn and Judge Parker's court.
      
      Mattie has the cinch loose. She reaches the Colt's Dragoon out of the sack and points it at
      Chaney.
                                                                                              89
      
                    . . . I have come to take you back to Fort Smith.
      
      Chaney looks at the gun. He grins and puts hands on hips.
      
                                            Chaney
                    Well I will not go. How do you like that?
      
                                               Mattie
                    There is a posse of officers up on the hill who will force you
                    to go.
      
                                              Chaney
                    That is interesting news. How many is up there?
      
                                              Mattie
                    Right around fifty. They are all well armed and they mean
                    business. What I want you to do now is come on across the
                    creek and walk in front of me up the hill.
      
                                               Chaney
                    I think I will oblige the officers to come after me.
      
                                                Mattie
                    If you refuse to go I will have to shoot you.
      
                                           Chaney
                    Oh? Then you had better cock your piece.
      
      Mattie gives a dismayed look at the gun and tries to pull the hammer back. It has a heavy
      pull: she struggles, using two thumbs.
      
      Chaney watches, smiling.
      
                    . . . All the way back til it locks.
      
                                                 Mattie
                    I know how to do it.
      
      She pulls the hammer back further and we hear it notch. She looks up.
      
                    . . . You will not go with me?
      
                                                 Chaney
                    I think not. It is just the other way around. You are going
                                                                                               90
                      with me. I will--
      
      Mattie fires.
      
      Chaney, shocked, takes a staggering step back.
      
      Mattie stumbles and falls back under the recoil, into the stream but careful to hold the gun
      high and dry. She awkwardly reclaims her footing and retrains the gun. Chaney is looking
      down at his bleeding side.
      
                                               Chaney
                      I did not think you would do it.
      
                                                Mattie
                      What do you think now?
      
                                                Chaney
                      One of my short ribs is broken. It hurts jiggers every breath
                      I take.
      
                                                Mattie
                      You killed my father when he was trying to help you. I have
                      one of the gold pieces you took from him. Now give me the
                      other.
      
      She is struck by a worrying thought. She hastily recocks the gun.
      
                                                Chaney
                      I regret that shooting. Mr. Ross was decent to me but he
                      ought not to have meddled in my business.
      
      Crashing from the brush up the hill, and a voice:
      
                                               Rooster
                      Mattie!
      
                                             Mattie
                      I am down here! Chaney is taken into custody!
      
                                               Chaney
                      I was drinking and I was mad through and through. Nothing
                      has gone right for me.
      
      There is yelling from the other bank now too.
                                                                                               91
                                                Mattie
                     No, you are just a piece of trash, that is all.
      
                                              Chaney
                     Everything is against me. Now I am shot by a child.
      
      He sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Stop!
      
      She squeezes the trigger, but the gun dry fires.
      
      Chaney grabs the gun and flings it away, then holds on to Mattie and slaps her.
      
                                          Mattie
                     Help me! Down here! Hurry up!
      
      Two men burst through the brush from Chaney's side of the river. One is in woolly chaps
      --Lucky Ned Pepper. The other is taller and dressed almost formally in a linen suit and
      string tie and a bear coat. Both men bear Winchester repeating rifles.
      
      Chaney is dragging Mattie to their bank, slapping at her along the way.
      
      Rooster emerges from his side of the riverbank carrying a side arm.
      
      The men exchange fire.
      
                                           Lucky Ned
                                          (to Chaney)
                     Take them horses you got and move!
      
      He grabs Mattie from Chaney and keeps her between himself and the far bank as he fires
      again.
      
      One hand to his bleeding side, Chaney lunges for the horses' leads.
      
      Rooster has retreated back to the tree cover, as has the well dressed man on our side.
      Intermittent gunshots and the panicked neighing of horses. Lucky Ned falls back into the
      trees with Mattie and starts pulling her up the steep hill.
      
      Chaney follows pulling the string of horses. He is breathing hard and blood stains the front
      of his shirt.
                                                                                                   92
                                            Lucky Ned
                                            (to Chaney)
                     Get on up that hill! Don't you stop.
      
      He twists Mattie around to face him and we see him clearly for the first time. Part of his
      upper lip and three of his front teeth are missing.
      
                     . . . Who all is down there?
      
                                             Mattie
                     Marshal Cogburn and fifty more officers.
      
      Lucky Ned throws Mattie to the ground. He puts a muddy boot on her neck.
      
                                             Lucky Ned
                     Tell me another lie and I will stove your head in!
      
      Mattie manages to choke out:
      
                                                  Mattie
                     Just the marshal.
      
                                          Lucky Ned
                     Cogburn! Do you hear me?
      
      Silence.
      
                     . . . You answer me, Rooster! I will kill this girl! You know
                     I will do it!
      
                                           Rooster's Voice
                     The girl is nothing to me! She is a runaway from Arkansas!
      
                                            Lucky Ned
                     That is very well! Do you advise me to kill her?
      
                                         Rooster's Voice
                     Do what you think is best, Ned! She is nothing to me but a
                     lost child!
      
      A short beat, through which we hear only the rush of riverwater. Then, Rooster's voice
      again:
      
                     . . . Think it over first.
                                                                                               93
                                              Lucky Ned
                     I have already thought it over! You get mounted double fast!
                     If I see you riding over that bald ridge to the northwest I will
                     spare the girl. You have five minutes!
      
      He breaks open his rifle and starts to reload.
      
                                              Rooster
                     I will need more than five minutes!
      
                                            Lucky Ned
                     I will not give you more time.
      
                                               Rooster
                     There will be a party of marshals in here soon, Ned! Let me
                     have Chaney and the girl and I will mislead them for six
                     hours!
      
                                           Lucky Ned
                     Too thin, Rooster! Too thin! Your five minutes is running!
                     No more talk!
      
      He pulls Mattie to her feet. Rooster's voice trails away:
      
                                          Rooster's Voice
                     I am leaving but you must give me time!
      
      Lucky Ned gives Mattie a rough push.
      
                                              Lucky Ned
                     Up that hill!
      
      Mattie advances, Lucky Ned giving periodic shoves from behind.
      
      A stout young man with a shotgun leaps out from behind a slab of limestone in front of
      them. He has a round face and idiot eyes.
      
      He makes loud turkey-gobbling noises at Mattie.
      
      Though Mattie is startled Lucky Ned does not immediately react, but he does finally tire of
      the turkey noises:
      
                                              Lucky Ned
                     Quiet there!
                                                                                             94
      The idiot makes a pig-squealing sound in acknowledgment and then falls quiet, loping
      alongside Mattie and Lucky Ned.
      
                                              Mattie
                    You will not shoot me.
      
      Lucky Ned is grim:
      
                                            Lucky Ned
                    I will do what I have to do.
      
      They are ascending out of the trees onto a bare rock ledge not quite at the crest of the
      mountain. The rock floor is uneven and broken by fissures and holes. A cave-like setback
      at the far end of the rock shelf is half-curtained with a hide. A rough camp.
      
      A cookfire burns on the open rock. Two coffeepots warm leaning against the inside of the
      fire's piled-stone perimeter. A skillet holds bacon.
      
      A man squats at the fire, holding a piece of bacon, turned to watch Lucky Ned and Mattie's
      approach. He wears a filthy Union army uniform with officer's boards. His mouth is an 0
      of surprise.
      
                                             Mattie
                    Can I have some of that bacon?
      
                                          Lucky Ned
                    Help yourself. Have some of the coffee.
      
                                              Mattie
                    I do not drink coffee. I am fourteen.
      
                                          Lucky Ned
                    We do not have buttermilk. And we do not have bread. We
                    are poorly supplied. What are you doing here?
      
      Tom Chaney has reached the rock ledge and he charges Mattie with a yell.
      
                                             Chaney
                    I will wring your scrawny neck!
      
      Lucky Ned knocks him aside.
      
                                             Lucky Ned
                    Let that go! Farrell, see to his wound. What happened?
                    What are you doing here?
                                                                                                95
      
                                               Mattie
                    I will tell you what and you will see that I am in the right.
                    Tom Chaney there shot my father to death in Fort Smith and
                    robbed him of two gold pieces and stole his mare. Her name
                    is Judy but I did not see her down at the river. I was
                    informed Rooster Cogburn had grit and I hired him out to
                    find the murderer. A few minutes ago I came upon Chaney
                    watering the horses. He would not be taken in charge and I
                    shot him. If I had killed him I would not be now in this fix.
                    My revolver misfired.
      
                                              Lucky Ned
                    They will do it. It will embarrass you every time. Most girls
                    like to play pretties, but you like guns do you?
      
                                                Mattie
                    I do not care a thing in the world about guns. If I did I would
                    have one that worked.
      
                                             Chaney
                    I was shot from ambush, Ned. The horses was blowing and
                    making noise. It was that officer that got me.
      
                                             Mattie
                    How can you sit there and tell such a big story?
      
      Chaney, squatting with his shirt pulled up for the ex-soldier to work on his wound, now
      rises.
      
                                               Chaney
                    That pit is a hundred feet deep and I will throw you into it
                    and leave you to scream and rot! How do you like that?
      
                                             Mattie
                    No you won't. This man will not let you have your way. He
                    is your boss and you must do as he tells you.
      
      Chaney turns to Lucky Ned who has a spyglass to his eye, scanning a ridge across the
      river.
      
                                               Chaney
                    Five minutes is well up!
      
      Lucky Ned speaks quietly, without lowering the glass:
                                                                                             96
      
                                               Lucky Ned
                     I will give him a little more time.
      
      From somewhere in the woods below we hear the idiot's gobbling noises.
      
                                               Chaney
                     How much more?
      
                                             Lucky Ned
                     Til I think he has had enough.
      
      The voice of the well dressed man floats up from the woods:
      
                                        Well Dressed Man
                     He is gone, Ned! I can see nothing! We had best make a
                     move!
      
                                             Lucky Ned
                     Hold fast a while there, Doctor!
      
      Mattie looks at Chaney moaning in pain as the ex-soldier works on his side.
      
                                             Mattie
                     Why doesn't the Doctor do that?
      
      Lucky Ned replies absently, still gazing out:
      
                                            Lucky Ned
                     He is not a medical doctor. Was that Rooster waylaid us
                     night before last?
      
                                             Mattie
                     It was Marshal Cogburn and myself.
      
                                           Lucky Ned
                     Yourself, eh? You and Cogburn, quite the posse.
      
      He sees something and hastily raises the glass.
      
      A horseman is ascending the treeless ridge across the river with a riderless horse--Little
      Blackie--in tow. At the top he pauses and turns, and draws a revolver from his saddle and
      points it skyward. We see the gun kick and breathe gunsmoke. A second later we hear the
      shot.
                                                                                            97
      Lucky Ned lowers the glass and takes a gun and shoots skyward. He raises the glass
      again.
      
      The horseman turns away and proceeds on over the crest. He is gone.
      
      Lucky Ned turns to Mattie. He comes and squats at the fire.
      
                                          Lucky Ned
                    Your friend is gone. You are alone.
      
      The well dressed man and the idiot trudge up from the woods onto the rock ledge.
      
      The man in the dirty uniform continues to perform crude field surgery on Chaney, digging
      into his side with a knife to extract the bullet. As Chaney moans the idiot makes calf-
      bawling noises in imitation.
      
                                    Well Dressed Man
                    We must move, Ned.
      
                                          Lucky Ned
                    You are too nervous, Doctor. It will be hours before he is
                    back with help.
      
      Lucky Ned turns back to Mattie.
      
                    . . . What happened to Quincy, and The Kid?
      
                                               Mattie
                    They are both dead. I was in the very middle of it. It was a
                    terrible thing to see. Do you need a good lawyer?
      
                                            Lucky Ned
                    I need a good judge. What about Coke Hayes--the old
                    fellow shot off his horse?
      
                                            Mattie
                    Dead as well. His depredations have come to an end.
      
                                           Lucky Ned
                    Poor Coke. He rode back for me. Coke Hayes had spine,
                    and could keep his wits in a tight spot. Dead now, but he
                    should have been dead ten times afore now. Your friend
                    Rooster does not collect many prisoners.
                                                                                                98
                                              Mattie
                     He is not my friend. He has abandoned me to a congress of
                     louts.
      
                                           Lucky Ned
                     You do not varnish your opinions.
      
                                        Well Dressed Man
                     Are we staying here for chat?
      
      The idiot is still bawling. Chaney grabs a stone and flings it at him and the idiot scampers
      back, making goat noises. Chaney grabs, moaning, at the wound aggravated by this fresh
      exertion.
      
      The man in officer's boards laughs.
      
                                               Soldier
                     Do an owl, Harold!
      
                                                Idiot
                     Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
      
                                              Chaney
                     Let us cut up the winnings from the Katie Flyer.
      
      Lucky Ned straightens from the fire and begins to collect his meager belongings. The
      other men follow suit.
      
                                             Lucky Ned
                     There will be time for that at The Old Place.
      
                                               Chaney
                     I will saddle the grey.
      
                                             Lucky Ned
                     I have other plans for you.
      
                                            Chaney
                     Must I double-mount with the Doctor?
      
                                          Well Dressed Man
                     No!
      
                                             Lucky Ned
                     No, it will be too chancy with two men up if it comes to a
                                                                                              99
                    race. You will wait here with the girl. When we reach Ma's house I will
                    send Carroll back with a fresh mount. You will be out by
                    dark and we will wait for you at The Old Place.
      
                                               Chaney
                    I don't like that. Let me ride with you, Ned, just out of here
                    anyway.
      
                                          Lucky Ned
                    No. We are short a horse. It can't be helped.
      
                                           Chaney
                    Marshals will come swarming.
      
                                           Lucky Ned
                    Hours, if they come here at all. They will guess we are all
                    gone.
      
                                              Mattie
                    I am not staying here by myself with Tom Chaney.
      
                                            Lucky Ned
                    That is the way I will have it.
      
                                            Mattie
                    He will kill me. You have heard him say it. He has killed
                    my father and now you will let him kill me.
      
                                           Lucky Ned
                    He will do no such thing. Tom, you know the crossing at
                    Cypress Forks, near the log meetinghouse? When you are
                    mounted you will take the girl there and leave her. Do you
                    understand that, Tom? If any harm comes to this child you
                    do not get paid.
      
      Chaney stares at Lucky Ned. His gaze then swings to the idiot.
      
                                             Chaney
                    Harold, let me ride up with you.
      
                                               Idiot
                    Baaaaa! Baaaaa!
      
                                               Chaney
                    Farrel, I will pay you fifty dollars out of my winnings! I am
                                                                                            100
                       not heavy!
      
                                                Soldier
                       Ha ha! Do the calf again, Harold!
      
      The men, clanking with gear, cross the rock ledge and descend into the woods.
      
      In the quiet, Chaney is disconsolate.
      
                                                   Chaney
                       Everything is against me.
      
                                                Mattie
                       You have no reason to whine. If you act as the bandit chief
                       instructed, and no harm comes to me, you will get your
                       winnings at The Old Place.
      
      We faintly hear the rest of his party mount up and gallop off. Chaney drops heavily before
      the fire to sit staring.
      
                                                Chaney
                       They will not wait for me at The Old Place. Lucky Ned has
                       left me, knowing I am sure to be caught when I leave on
                       foot.
      
                                                   Mattie
                       He is sending a mount.
      
                                               Chaney
                       That was a story. Keep still now. I must think over my
                       position and how I may improve it.
      
      A silent beat.
      
                                                Mattie
                       Where is the second California gold piece?
      
      Chaney continues to stare silently into the fire.
      
                                              Mattie
                       What have you done with Papa's mare?
      
                                                  Chaney
                       Keep still, you little busybody.
                                                                                                101
      More brooding silence.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Are you thinking about The Old Place? If you will let me
                     go, I will swear to it in an affidavit and once you are brought
                     to justice it may go easier on you.
      
      Chaney rises, glaring at her.
      
                                                 Chaney
                     I tell you I can do better than that. I do not intend to be
                     caught. I need no affidavit.
      
      He is striding toward her. She backs toward the ledge.
      
                     . . . All I need is your silence. And I will have it.
      
      Without breaking stride he plows into her, good hand raised to catch her by the throat.
      
      She tumbles backward, Chaney on top of her sweating and snarling.
      
                     . . . Your father was a busybody like you. There are always
                     people who will tell you what's right.
      
      On her back Mattie struggles, but Chaney, straddling her, has her pinned. His good hand is
      still on her throat. She claws at it.
      
      He swats her with his free hand. Her clawing stops.
      
      Chaney is wincing from the swing of his own arm. As he leans over her his opened wound
      dribbles blood onto Mattie along with his sweat.
      
                     . . . In honesty, I do not regret shooting him. He thought
                     Tom Chaney was small. Lucky Ned thinks the same. And
                     you would give me an affidavit.
      
      He reaches back awkwardly toward his calf with his bad hand, groaning with the stretch.
      We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath.
      
                     . . . You are all against me. Everything is against me.
      
      He pushes against the underside of Mattie's chin, stretching her neck.
      
      Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to
      her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension.
                                                                                                102
      
                     . . . But here at least I have matters in hand, and once I have
                     done for you--
      
      Whack--a rifle stock swings into frame, connecting with Chaney's head. His head snaps
      to one side and then lolls back as he slowly straightens, ropey drool and blood pouring
      from his mouth. He sways briefly and then collapses onto Mattie.
      
      A hand enters to pull him off. Mattie blearily props herself on her elbows.
      
      LeBoeuf is panting and sweating from his climb. He gazes down at Chaney. Once he has
      breath:
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     Sho that ish Chelmthford. Shtrange to be sho closhe at lasht.
      
                                                Mattie
                     How is it you are here?
      
      LeBoeuf's look breaks from Chaney. He pulls his pipe from his pocket and lights it.
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     I heard the shotsh and went down to the river. . .
      
      He crosses the rock ledge.
      
                     . . . Cogburn outlined a plan. Hizh part, I fear, izh rash.
                     (reacts to hole) But that izh a pit there! Mind your footing.
      
      He skirts the large hole and reaches the shelf's far lip and gazes out. Before him is a steep
      drop-off. We see the very crowns of near pines and then, four hundred yards away, the
      land flattening to an open meadow.
      
      Mattie, also gazing out, comes up beside LeBoeuf.
      
                                                Mattie
                     A plan?
      
      LeBoeuf points with his pipe.
      
                                            LeBoeuf
                     He returnzh for Lucky Ned.
      
      Lucky Ned, the Parmalees, and the Doctor are just entering the low meadow, riding away.
      As they do so Rooster enters at the far side, facing. He draws one of his navy sixes as he
                                                                                           103
      advances.
      
                                                  Mattie
                      One against four. It is ill advised.
      
      Leboeuf shrugs.
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                      He would not be dishuaded.
      
      He and Mattie both watch as, below, the parties advance on each other at a walk. Eighty
      yards separating them, they halt.
      
      
      THE MEADOW
      
      Rooster and Lucky Ned eye each other. After a beat:
      
                                             Lucky Ned
                      Well, Rooster, will you give us the road?
      
                                                  Idiot
                      Moo! Moo!
      
                                           Rooster
                      Hello, Ned. How many men are with the girl?
      
                                              Lucky Ned
                      Just Chaney. Our agreement is in force: she was in excellent
                      health when last I saw her.
      
      Rooster nods.
      
      A beat.
      
                                               Rooster
                      Farrel, I want you and your brother to stand clear. You as
                      well, Doctor. I have no interest in you today.
      
                                              Lucky Ned
                      What is your intention, Rooster? Do you think one on four is
                      a dogfall?
      
                                                Rooster
                      I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned. Or see you hanged in
                                                                                                104
                     Fort Smith at Judge Parker's convenience. Which will you
                     have?
      
      Ned Pepper laughs.
      
                                               Lucky Ned
                     I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man!
      
                                                 Idiot
                     Koo koo roo! Blawk!
      
                                              Rooster
                     Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!
      
      He puts the reins in his teeth, grabs his other revolver with the hand now free, and spurs his
      horse.
      
      
      ROCK LEDGE
      
      Mattie watches him charge.
      
      The facing four charge to meet him.
      
                                            Mattie
                     Shoot them, Mr. LeBoeuf!
      
                                             LeBoeuf
                     Too far, moving too fasht.
      
      Over the distant laughter of the idiot, the crackle of gunfire commences.
      
      
      THE MEADOW
      
      Rooster turns his head to either side as he fires, bringing his good eye into play.
      
      The idiot is gaily waving a revolver over his head, not firing, squawking like a chicken as
      he charges.
      
      A shot from Rooster kills him and swipes him neatly off his horse.
      
      Farrel Parmalee has a shotgun. It roars.
      
      Shot peppers Rooster. He returns fire.
                                                                                                105
      
      Farrel Parmalee's horse is hit. It stumbles, and Farrel is dashed forward, snapping his
      neck.
      
      The Doctor Indian-rides past, sliding down and hooking an ankle on his saddle so that he
      may ride in the cover of his horse's body. He makes for the treeline on the far side of the
      meadow.
      
      Rooster and Lucky Ned are charging each other, both firing.
      
      They pass each other--both still mounted--but Rooster's horse has been hit and it falls,
      pinning Rooster's leg. His guns are gone, lost in the fall.
      
      Rooster, bleeding from sprayed shot in neck, face, and shoulder, struggles and unpins his
      leg.
      
      
      ROCK LEDGE
      
      LeBoeuf sits cross-legged and brings the butt of his Sharp's carbine to rest against his
      injured shoulder. He nudges the gunstock back and forth, looking for the anchor that will
      cause him the least pain. He cocks his head to sight, puffing pipesmoke.
      
      
      MEADOW
      
      Lucky Ned is reining his horse around with his left hand. His right arm dangles. He walks
      his horse toward Rooster, who is getting to his feet.
      
                                            Lucky Ned
                     Well Rooster, I am shot to pieces. It seems neither of us is to
                     see Judge Parker.
      
      He drops the reins to reach out a gun with his one working arm.
      
      
      ROCK LEDGE
      
      LeBoeuf, sighting.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     Oh lord.
      
      He squeezes the trigger.
                                                                                               106
      He screams as the gun roars and bucks back into his shoulder.
      
      
      THE MEADOW
      
      Rooster is facing Lucky Ned.
      
      Lucky Ned raises his gun at Rooster and--is shot in the chest.
      
      As we hear the weakly distant guncrack Ned flops backward, slides halfway down one side
      of the saddle, and dangles, briefly, foot tangled in a stirrup, horse standing unperturbed.
      
      Then, he drops.
      
      
      ROCK LEDGE
      
      Mattie whoops as LeBoeuf groans.
      
                                             Mattie
                     Some bully shot! Four hundred yards, at least!
      
      LeBoeuf sets the rifle down and gropes at his shoulder.
      
                                              LeBoeuf
                     I am afraid I have--
      
      A rock is brought down on his head by Tom Chaney.
      
      Mattie screams.
      
      LeBoeuf has collapsed and is motionless. Chaney drops the rock and stoops for the rifle.
      
      Mattie is already dragging it away. She grabs it up.
      
                                               Mattie
                     Stand up, Tom Chaney!
      
      Chaney stands nearly straight--as much as his injuries will allow, and--
      
      Boom!--the blast catches Chaney in the chest and he is blown back off the ledge, looking
      surprised. He falls to oblivion.
      
      But the carbine recoil pushes Mattie stumbling back and this, with the bad footing at the lip
      of the pit behind her, sends her falling.
                                                                                                107
      
      
      PIT
      
      Mattie is tumbling. She bounces down a very steep slope, disturbed earth tumbling with
      her, protruding roots and slender upgrowing foliage slapping at her on her descent.
      
      As she descends more or less feet-first something snags an ankle and her inertia sends her
      upper body on down past the pinned leg. She jerks to a halt head-downmost on the steep
      slope.
      
      The patter of falling dirt subsides. Silence. Heavy breathing.
      
      Mattie, lying face-up, does a painful half sit-up to look around.
      
      Above her, her left foot is snarled through some roots. Well beyond, very high, weak light
      defines the mouth of the pit.
      
      Using her elbows she pivots, scooting her upper body uphill so that she is no longer below
      her foot. She reaches the cuff of her pants on the trapped leg and pulls it up to expose the
      shin.
      
      A splinter of broken bone has punctured the skin.
      
      She pulls the cuff back down.
      
      She stretches to slip fingers between her boot and the roots in which it is fouled. She just
      manages to work in two fingers; in wrenching around, the root has cinched tight. She tugs
      feebly at the root, which shows no signs of give.
      
      She looks back up.
      
      The small hole of weak daylight, dust drifting up toward it.
      
                                            Mattie
                     Mr. LeBoeuf! Are you alive!
      
      No answer.
      
                     . . . Mr. LeBoeuf!
      
      Arms tiring, she lays back again against earth. She looks around.
      
      Partway round the pit, just at her level, something difficult to discern in the semi-dark: two
      mirroring shapes, close to each other: is it the soles of a pair of boots?
                                                                                                   108
      
      Mattie squints. She props herself partway up.
      
      Higher view: they are boots--worn by a corpse--stretching away from us, foreshortened.
      The man's skull has been partly shattered by the protruding rock against which it rests.
      
      Mattie surveys the body. Her attention is caught by something:
      
      The skeletal remains are still clothed and there seems to be something held by a bandolier
      strapped across the chest, over the body's decomposing blue shirt but beneath a tattered
      vest. A sheath is just visible high on the strap, near the corpse's shoulder. The butt-end of
      a knife juts out.
      
      Mattie stretches, reaching.
      
      She can just get to a boot.
      
      She pulls.
      
      The man's remains seem to be fairly light. They drag across earth, raising dust, tending to
      slide away with the grade of the pit.
      
      Mattie reels the body in, careful not to let go and lose it down the hill. She pulls shoe,
      pants cuff, pants knee, belt. The bandolier is close.
      
      Her fingers curl around shirt, and pull.
      
      The shirt's buttons softly pop and fiber dust drifts up as the fabric falls to pieces. Rib cage
      is exposed beneath.
      
      Mattie hastily reaches and curls fingers around ribs. She pulls. She is about to get the
      knife when--
      
      A glistening something inside the rib cage--guts?--starts to slowly move. But it can't be
      guts: it is gliding, coiling, under its own power.
      
      A faint rattle.
      
      Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens. One snake starts to slowly emerge,
      and she bats the body away.
      
      She pushes and kicks with her free leg, as much as her pinned attitude will allow. The
      body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark. It disappears. Fiber and bone
      dust float up toward us. We hear rattles.
                                                                                              109
      Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back
      toward the body. The root holds fast.
      
      A snake is sluggishly and sinuously weaving up the earth toward her. She muscles her
      body upward so that once again her pinned leg is bottom-most.
      
                                                Mattie
                     Mr. LeBoeuf!
      
      Another snake is behind the first. . . several more behind that.
      
      As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie freezes. The first snake
      continues climbing, weaving up the slope alongside Mattie's body. She watches it come
      on, its blunted head with its flicking tongue inches from her face. The head passes, the
      body goes coiling by.
      
      Another snake undulates onto her pinned leg.
      
                                           Rooster's Voice
                     Are you there?
      
      Careful to keep still, eyes on the advancing snakes:
      
                                                Mattie
                     I am here!
      
      More snakes climb onto her.
      
                                        Rooster's Voice
                     Can you clamber out?
      
                                                Mattie
                     I cannot!
      
      A large snake is winding onto her shoulder. She gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto;
      it does; she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off.
      
                     . . . There are snakes!
      
                                               Rooster
                     Awake?
      
                                                Mattie
                     Yes!
                                                                                              110
      Rooster appears in the mouth of the pit. He has a rope wrapped round his waist and he
      starts to descend, half walking, half hopping against the pit wall.
      
      Mattie winces and looks down at one hand.
      
      A small snake wrapped round her wrist has its fangs in the meat of the hand.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Ahh!
      
                                                 Rooster
                     What is that?
      
      She flaps her hand and the snake plops off.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     I am bit!
      
      BAM!--a burst of orange as Rooster, descended to the level of the lead snakes, starts firing
      his revolver.
      
      BAM! BAM! More orange lightning flashes.
      
      Lively rattling.
      
      The pit fills with roiling gunsmoke.
      
      Rooster starts to stomp as well as fire. He kicks the more sluggish specimens toward the
      bottom of the pit.
      
      He reaches Mattie and takes out a knife.
      
                                            Mattie
                     Does Mr. LeBoeuf survive?
      
                                             Rooster
                     He does--even a blow to the head could silence him for only
                     a few short minutes. Where are you bit?
      
      She shows her hand and he makes two slices in the flesh and squeezes out blood. As he
      does so:
      
                     . . . He is in mild distress, having swallowed a good piece of
                     his pipestem. Can you move?
                                                                                                111
      
                                              Mattie
                     My foot is pinned and leg broken.
      
      Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot. He wraps one arm
      around Mattie's waist and tips his head back and bellows:
      
                                                Rooster
                     I have her! Up with us!
      
      The rope tautens and starts pulling, Rooster helping with his feet.
      
      
      THE LEDGE
      
      Little Blackie, led by a wobbly LeBoeuf, finishes pulling Rooster and Mattie from the pit.
      
      Rooster is already unwrapping the rope from his waist and talking to LeBoeuf as he and
      Mattie emerge:
      
                                               Rooster
                     I will send help for you as soon as I can. Don't wander off.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     We are not leaving him!
      
      Rooster heaves her up onto the back of Little Blackie, LeBoeuf helping though blood still
      flows down one side of his face.
      
                                               Rooster
                     I must get you to a doctor, sis, or you are not going to make
                     it. (to LeBoeuf) The girl is snakebit. We are off.
      
      He swings up behind her and nods down to LeBoeuf.
      
                     . . . I am in your debt for that shot, pard.
      
                                            LeBoeuf
                     Never doubt the Texash Ranger.
      
      Rooster reins the horse around and spurs it. LeBouef shouts after:
      
                     . . . Ever shtalwart!
      
      The horse takes to the steep slope reluctantly, with stiff legs, Rooster kicking it on. Tree
                                                                                                112
      branches slap at him and take his hat. His face, already peppered with shot, gets new
      scratches.
      
      
      THE MEADOW
      
      Mattie is woozy. As Little Blackie crosses the field at full gallop Mattie looks blearily at
      the littering bodies of horses and men.
      
      Next to Lucky Ned's body his horse, saddled and riderless, swings its head to watch as
      Rooster and Mattie pass.
      
      Mattie's eyes are closing.
      
      
      LATE DAY
      
      Mattie's eyes half-open.
      
      Little Blackie plunges on, through a rough road in woods, but slower now, his mouth
      foaming.
      
                                               Rooster
                     Come on, you!
      
                                              Mattie
                     We must stop. Little Blackie is played out.
      
      Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim:
      
                                               Rooster
                     We have miles yet.
      
      He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife. He leans back and slashes at the
      horse's whithers. Little Blackie surges.
      
      Mattie screams.
      
                                                Mattie
                     No!
      
      A locked-down shot as horse and riders enter at a gallop and recede.
      
      
      NIGHT
                                                                                                113
      
      It has started to snow.
      
      Mattie is flushed and soaked with sweat.
      
      The horse is laboring for breath.
      
      Rooster gives inarticulate curses as he kicks it on.
      
      Mattie looks ahead:
      
      Barely visible in the moonlight a man mounted bareback rides on ahead. A sash cord
      holds a rifle to his back.
      
      He recedes, outpacing us, disappearing into the darkness and the falling snow.
      
                                                 Mattie
                     He is getting away.
      
                                                Rooster
                     Who is getting away?
      
                                                 Mattie
                     Chaney.
      
                                                Rooster
                     Hold on, sis.
      
      Mattie is falling. It is unclear why.
      
      Her legs squeeze the horses flanks.
      
      Her hand tightens on the horses mane.
      
      Rooster's arm reaches around to hold her.
      
      Little Blackie is giving out, going to his knees and then all the way down.
      
      Rooster hangs on to Mattie as the horse sinks. He pulls her clear, lays her on the ground,
      and then steps away from her, taking out a gun.
      
      The horrible noises coming from the horse end with a gunshot. Rooster reenters to pick up
      Mattie but she screams at him and claws at his face, opening fresh gashes.
      
      He ducks his head as best he can to avoid the claws but that is the extent of his reaction.
                                                                                                   114
      
                                            Rooster
                     Put your arms around my neck, I will carry.
      
      He presents his back and she relents, clasping her arms. He rises with a pained wheeze and
      he starts jogging with Mattie piggie-back.
      
      Bouncing at his shoulder, she twists to look back.
      
      In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller.
      
      Mattie turns forward again, eyes drooping.
      
      
      LATER
      
      Rooster is loudly wheezing as he carries Mattie before him now, his jog slowed to an
      unsteady walk. Her eyes are opening again.
      
      They are now on a proper dirt road. Rooster staggers around a turn and does a barely
      controlled stumble to his knees, and then sits heavily back, Mattie in his lap.
      
      Up ahead is the front porch of Bagby's store, the building dark.
      
      Rooster sits gasping.
      
      Mattie's voice is thick:
      
                                                Mattie
                     Where are we?
      
      Rooster takes out his gun, weakly raises his arm, and fires into the air. He sits panting.
      
                                               Rooster
                      I have grown old.
      
      The door of the distant store opens and someone emerges, holding a lamp, peering out into
      the dark.
      
      FADE OUT
      
      
      TRAIN
      
      We are looking into the window of a moving train. Looking out past us is a thin forty-
                                                                                               115
      year-old woman.
      
      Reflected in the window is a sizable railyard and then, as the train slows, a station.
      Reading backward in the mirror of the window is the station stop: MEMPHIS.
      
      We hear the voice, familiar from the opening of the movie, of the grown Mattie Ross:
      
                                             Voice-Over
                     A quarter of a century is a long time.
      
      
      TRAIN DOOR
      
      As the train eases to a stop the woman, Mattie, steps down. One sleeve of her dress is
      pinned up.
      
                                               Voice-Over
                     I had written a letter of thanks to Marshal Cogburn, with an
                     invitation to visit, along with the fifty dollars I owed him.
                     In his reply he promised he would try to call next time he
                     came to Fort Smith with prisoners. Brief though his note
                     was, it was rife with misspellings.
      
      Mattie goes along the platform, holding a small bag in one hand and, crushed against its
      handle, a flier.
      
                     . . . The marshal did not visit, nor did he communicate
                     further. I had not been conscious during his leavetaking: by
                     the time Bagby rode us to Fort Smith my hand had turned
                     black. I was not awake when I lost the arm. I later learned
                     that Mr. LeBoeuf recovered fully. When the marshals found
                     him he was searching the pines below the rock ledge for
                     Tom Chaney's body. He found it and took it back to San
                     Saba for the reward. It was well earned.
      
      In the scene, Mattie calls peremptorily to a young boy on the platform:
      
                                                Mattie
                     Boy.
      
      She shows him the flier:
      
                                 The Cole Younger and Frank James
                                          Wild West Show
                                 Riding! Shooting! Lariat "Tricks" !
                                                                                               116
                      Don't Leave the Ladies and the Little Ones Behind!
                                         Also Featuring
                                       Rooster Cogburn!
                            He will amaze you with his skill and dash!
                                     Memphis Fairgrounds
                                          July 18, 1908
      
      The boy looks up and points.
      
      Mattie crosses the platform and further along, descends to the railyard.
      
      The cars of the Wild West Show are parked along a siding. They display gaudily painted
      scenes of men on rearing horses firing six-guns, of conestoga wagons, war-bonneted
      Indians, bandana-wearing bad men. Three featured performers have their own vignetted
      scenes, each depicted as a youngish man engaged in Wild West hell-raising, each with his
      name painted beneath: Cole Younger, Frank James, and (unrecognizable but for the
      eyepatch) Rooster Cogburn. Below Rooster's name is the sublegend "He rode with
      Quantrill! He rode for Parker!"
      
      Around the rail cars cowboys--and some Indians--mill, more wobegone than their painted
      representations.
      
      Mattie asks someone along the way for directions and is pointed toward the rear of the
      train.
      
                                              Voice-Over
                     Little Frank had sent me the flier. He had chaffed me
                     through the years over the fact that I had not married, calling
                     the marshal my "secret sweetheart," and he sent a note with
                     the advertisement: "Skill and dash--it's not too late,
                     Mattie!" Little Frank and Victoria have always liked jokes
                     and they are all right in their place. I have never held it
                     against either one of them for leaving me at home to look
                     after Mama, and they know it, for I have told them.
      
      Mattie speaks to two men who sit on the rear platform of the rear car. They are old men
      drinking Coca-Colas. One doffs his hat and rises when Mattie addresses the pair; the other
      stays seated, slurping from his bottle.
      
                                            Standing Man
                     Yes'm, I am Cole Younger. This is Mr. James. It grieves
                     me to tell you that you have missed Rooster. He passed
                     away, what, three days ago, when the show was in Jonesboro
                     Arkansas. Buried him there in the confederate cemetery.
                     Reuben had a complaint what he referred to as "night hoss"
                                                                                         117
                     and I believe the warm weather was too much for him. We
                     had some lively times. What was the nature of your
                     acquaintance?
      
                                              Mattie
                     I knew the marshal long ago. We too had lively times.
                     Thank you, Mr. Younger.
      
      As she turns to go she addresses Frank James, who has been staring at her:
      
                     . . . Keep your seat, trash.
      
      
      A BOXCAR
      
      Elsewhere; later.
      
      Men load in a muddy pine coffin. Chalked on the coffin top:
      
                                              Cogburn
                                             Yell County
                                            Hold at station
      
                                              Voice-Over
                     I had the marshal's body removed to Dardanelle. The
                     railroads do not like to carry disinterred bodies in the
                     summertime, but I had my way.
      
      The boxcar door is slammed and the train starts to move off.
      
                     . . . People love to talk. They love to slander you if you
                     have any substance. They said, Well, she hardly knew that
                     man. . .
      
      
      CEMETERY
      
      Mattie stands with a prayer book. There is a light, lazy fall of snow.
      
                                                 Voice-Over
                     . . . It's just like a cranky old maid to pull a stunt like that,
                     burying him in the family plot. They say I love nothing but
                     money and the Presbyterian Church and that is why I never
                     married. It is true that I love my church and my bank. I will
                     tell you a secret. Those same people talk mighty nice when
                                                                                    118
                     they come in for a crop loan or a mortgage extension. I care
                     nothing for what they say. I would have married a baboon if
                     I had wanted and fetched it its newspaper and slippers every
                     morning but I never had time to fool with it.
      
      She leaves, striding purposefully past the headstone.
      
      We show the headstone and, beyond, her receding figure.
      
                                          Reuben Cogburn
                                              1835-1908
                                          A Resolute Officer
                                          Of Parker's Court
      
      Her figure softens as it recedes.
      
                                              Voice-Over
                     Anyway, a woman with brains and a frank tongue and one
                     sleeve pinned up and an invalid mother to care for is not
                     widely sought after. I never did see Mr. LeBoeuf again but
                     if he is yet alive I would be pleased to hear from him. I
                     judge he would be in his seventies now and nearer eighty
                     than seventy. I expect some of the starch has gone out of
                     that cowlick. Time just gets away from us.



                                              THE END
