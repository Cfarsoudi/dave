FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

                         THE KID
             A little bit.

                         MOTHER
             Guess what.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         MOTHER
             Your grandfather's here.

                         THE KID
                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

                         MOTHER
             You are sick, that's why he's here.

                         THE KID
             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

                         MOTHER
             Maybe he won't.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2.


The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

                         THE KID
             What is it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

                         THE KID
             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

                         THE KID
             Has it got any sports in it?

THE GRANDFATHER

Suddenly passionate.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
             Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
             Chases. Escapes. True love.
             Miracles.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

                         THE KID
                  (manages a shrug)
             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
             try and stay awake.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Well, thank you very much.
             It's very nice of you. Your vote
             of confidence is overwhelming.
             All right.

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen doing his best)
             Yeah. It's really good.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            5.


BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (pointing to a pitcher
                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -hold it, hold it-

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             What is this? Are you trying to
             trick me? -- Where's the sports? --
             Is this a kissing book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             -- wait, just wait --

                         THE KID
             -- well, when does it get good?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             It was a very emotional time for
             Buttercup --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen groaning)
             I don't be-leeve this.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

                         WESTLEY
             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Westley didn't reach his
             destination. His ship was attacked
             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When
             Buttercup got the news that
             Westley was murdered --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen, perking
                  up a little)
             -- murdered by pirates is good --

CLOSE UP: Buttercup, staring out the window of her room.

                  (off-screen)
             She went into her room and shut
             the door. And for days, she
             neither slept nor ate.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (no emotion at all in
                  her voice)
             I will never love again.

HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,
livestock, and a bustling marketplace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Five years later, the main square
             of Florin City was filled as
             never before to hear the
             announcement of the great Prince
             Humperdinck's bride-to be.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing,
standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three
others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the
aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the
Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (raises his hands,
                  starts to speak)
             My people ... a month from now,
             our country will have its 500th
             anniversary. On that sundown, I
             shall marry a lady who was once a
             commoner like yourselves --
                  (pause)
             -- but perhaps you will not find
             her common now. Would you like to
             meet her?

And the answering YESSSS booms like summer thunder.

A giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just
begins to become visible,

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if
there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd,
collectively, holds its breath.

                                            CUT TO:

THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is
Buttercup. And she resplendent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My people ... the Princess
             Buttercup!!

She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no
instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great
waves of people kneeling and --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her
subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a
moment.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Buttercup's emptiness consumed
             her. Although the law of the land
             gave Humperdinck the right to
             choose his bride, she did not
             love him.

WOODLANDS

-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse
easily.

                  (off-screen)
             Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
             that she would grow to love him,
             the only joy she found was in her
             daily ride.

A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

                                            CUT TO:

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

                         BUTTERCUP
             There is nothing nearby; not for
             miles.

                         VIZZINI
             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

                                            CUT TO:

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

                                            CUT TO:

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.


                         VIZZINI
                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Those are the Shrieking Eels.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             We're past that, Grandpa.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

treading water.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           18.


A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.


And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           25.


THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...

                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.


A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.

                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           54.


Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

             What is it? What's the matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.


                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and
Buttercup.

WESTLEY

                         WESTLEY
             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           66.


                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                         ALBINO
                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.


He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                         RUGEN
                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

As they move on--

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice
reading.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

                                            CUT TO:

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.

                  (off-screen)
             And at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

And on these words--

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen, still reading)
             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             See? Didn't I tell you she'd
             never marry that rotten
             Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands
nearby.

                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.
                  (Finding the knot on
                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.


                         RUGEN
             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on
             the subject. So I want you to be
             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

                                            CUT TO:

A DIAL

with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50."
Rugen goes to it.

                         RUGEN

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the
wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes
from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as
we finally

He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and
pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?
             Tell me. And remember, this is
             for posterity, so be honest --
             how do you feel?

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

             As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
             I trust you with this secret:
             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such
             news.

             He will come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

                         INIGO
             -- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
             Vizzini --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.


                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while FEZZIK spoons him some
stew.

                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

                                            CUT TO:

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

                         FEZZIK
             -- what? --

                         INIGO
             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

                         INIGO

                  demons now)
             Don't bother me with trifles;
             after twenty years, at last, my
             father's soul will be at peace.

             Rise and report.

                         YELLIN
             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we
             marry. Tomorrow morning, your men
             will escort us to Florin Channel
             where every ship in my armada
             waits to accompany us on our
             honeymoon.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

                         YELLIN

             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharply)
             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
             having seen sooner that you were
             nothing but a coward with a heart

slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85.


WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the
lever and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

calling out --

                         RUGEN
             Not to fifty!!!

But it's too late as we --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

shoving the lever all the way up and

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY'S FACE

And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows
and with it now, something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise --

                                            CUT TO:

OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along, LOUDER AND LOUDER, and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.


YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear, and as the scream builds --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

                                            CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.


FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122.


                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

                                            CUT TO:

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...

As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.


                         THE KID
             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

                         THE KID
             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.

FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

                         THE KID
             A little bit.

                         MOTHER
             Guess what.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         MOTHER
             Your grandfather's here.

                         THE KID
                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

                         MOTHER
             You are sick, that's why he's here.

                         THE KID
             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

                         MOTHER
             Maybe he won't.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2.


The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

                         THE KID
             What is it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

                         THE KID
             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

                         THE KID
             Has it got any sports in it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
             Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
             Chases. Escapes. True love.
             Miracles.

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

                         THE KID
                  (manages a shrug)
             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
             try and stay awake.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Well, thank you very much.
             It's very nice of you. Your vote
             of confidence is overwhelming.
             All right.

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen doing his best)
             Yeah. It's really good.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (pointing to a pitcher
                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

                  (off-screen)

THE KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             What is this? Are you trying to
             trick me? -- Where's the sports? --
             Is this a kissing book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             -- wait, just wait --

                         THE KID
             -- well, when does it get good?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             It was a very emotional time for
             Buttercup --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen groaning)
             I don't be-leeve this.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

                         WESTLEY
             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Westley didn't reach his
             destination. His ship was attacked
             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When
             Buttercup got the news that
             Westley was murdered --

             She went into her room and shut
             the door. And for days, she
             neither slept nor ate.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (no emotion at all in
                  her voice)
             I will never love again.

HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad.

FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,
livestock, and a bustling marketplace.

                  (off-screen reading)
             Five years later, the main square
             of Florin City was filled as
             never before to hear the
             announcement of the great Prince
             Humperdinck's bride-to be.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing,

Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if
there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd,
collectively, holds its breath.

                                            CUT TO:

THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is
Buttercup. And she resplendent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My people ... the Princess
             Buttercup!!

She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no
instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great
waves of people kneeling and --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her
subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a
moment.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Buttercup's emptiness consumed
             her. Although the law of the land
             gave Humperdinck the right to
             choose his bride, she did not
             love him.

                                            CUT TO:

WOODLANDS

-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse
easily.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
             that she would grow to love him,
             the only joy she found was in her
             daily ride.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            9.


A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

                                            CUT TO:

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

                         BUTTERCUP
             There is nothing nearby; not for
             miles.

                         VIZZINI
             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

                                            CUT TO:

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

                                            CUT TO:

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.


                         VIZZINI
                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

             We're past that, Grandpa.

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.

And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           29.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.


A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.

                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.

Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

                         GRANDFATHER
             What is it? What's the matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.


                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and
Buttercup.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

                         WESTLEY
             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.

                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                         ALBINO
                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.


He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                         RUGEN
                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

As they move on--

                                            CUT TO:

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice
reading.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

                                            CUT TO:

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.


                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

And on these words--

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           71.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen, still reading)
             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             See? Didn't I tell you she'd
             never marry that rotten
             Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands
nearby.

                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.
                  (Finding the knot on
                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.

                         RUGEN
             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on
             the subject. So I want you to be
             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

A DIAL

Rugen goes to it.

                         RUGEN
             This being our first try, I'll
             use the lowest setting.

And he turns the dial to "1".

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens
the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the
wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

WESTLEY

and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the
chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes
from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as
we finally

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and
pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

                         RUGEN
             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?
             Tell me. And remember, this is
             for posterity, so be honest --
             how do you feel?

AND NOW, AT LAST:

WESTLEY

in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries.

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

                         RUGEN
             Interesting.

in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all
over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in
the doorway.

             Yellin.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
             I trust you with this secret:
             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such
             news.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Any word from Westley?

THE PRINCE AND YELLIN

turning to her in the doorway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Too soon, my angel. Patience.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He will come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

                         HUMPERDINCK

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

                         INIGO
             -- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
             Vizzini --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.


                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

stew.

                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

                                            CUT TO:

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

                         FEZZIK
             -- what? --

                         INIGO
             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

                         INIGO

                  demons now)
             Don't bother me with trifles;
             after twenty years, at last, my
             father's soul will be at peace.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK'S CHAMBERS

                  (sharpening his dagger)
             Rise and report.

                         YELLIN
             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we

             waits to accompany us on our
             honeymoon.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

                         YELLIN
                  (bows, exits)
             Your Majesties.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring at Humperdinck.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           84.


                         BUTTERCUP
             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharply)
             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
             having seen sooner that you were
             nothing but a coward with a heart
             full of fear.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (close to erupting;
                  speaks very distinctly)
             I-would-not-say-such things-if-
             Iwere-you-

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why not? You can't hurt me.
             Westley and I are joined by the
             bonds of love. And you cannot
             track that. Not with a thousand
             bloodhounds. And you cannot break
             it. Not with a thousand swords.
             And when I say you are a coward,
             that is only because you are the
             slimiest weakling ever to crawl
             the earth.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull
her along, out of control, his words indistinct.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU!

                                            CUT TO:

A CORRIDOR OF THE CASTLE

as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room,
slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85.


WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the
lever and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

calling out --

                         RUGEN
             Not to fifty!!!

But it's too late as we --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

shoving the lever all the way up and

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY'S FACE

And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows
and with it now, something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise --

                                            CUT TO:

OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along, LOUDER AND LOUDER, and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.


YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear, and as the scream builds --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

                                            CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing
CLERGYMAN imaginable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          103.


Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.


FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.

                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

                                            CUT TO:

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          123.


As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.


                         THE KID
             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

                         THE KID
             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.

                         FADE IN:
                         
                         
          EXT. EARTH - DAY (12,000 B.C.)
                         
          The world turns below us, vast and slow.
                         
          A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the
          shadow. We cast the shadow.
                         
          Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions:
          river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world.
          No trace of civilization.
                         
          The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an
          ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a
          VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.
                         
                         
          EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY
                         
          THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow.
                         
          They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white.
          Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker
          had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and
          hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
                         
          Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.
                         
          They are ENGINEERS.
                         
          Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
                         
          The third is naked.
                         
          One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box:
          inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.
                         
          The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness.
          It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises
          the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.
                         
          BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his
          lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.
                         
          Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of
          teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him.
                         
                         
                         FLASH ON:
                         
          A fevered glimpse of the microscopic: cells rupture and
          bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels.
           2.
                         
                         
          The scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material.
                         
                         
                         THE ENGINEER
                         
          ...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
                         
          The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach
          his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a
          felled tree. Engulfed.
                         
          The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
                         
          Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky.
                         
          As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in
          their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing.
          Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance.
                         
          A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement:
          far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain.
                         
          A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep.
          Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood.
                         
                         
                         FLASH ON:
                         
          A microscopic invasion. Cells pierced and infused. DNA
          strands twining and mating.
                         
                         
          CLOSE ON THE WOMAN
                         
          Pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs.
                         
          She slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab
          lies in her palm.
                         
          As she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
                         ON BLACK
                         
          Drifting motes of light against the dark: a starscape.
           3.
                         
                         
          An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with
          robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside
          the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
                         
          This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many
          disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.
                         
          The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt
          - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.
                         
          Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a
          rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches:
          we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.
                         
          The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The "stars"
          are plankton shining in the floodlights.
                         
                         
          INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. A
          sea-trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness.
                         
                          WATTS
           Moving to survey site B... closing on
           object four. The large oblong.
                         
          She watches the screen of a ground-penetrating radar system.
          A bright signal return: something hidden in the cliff in
          front of her. Something big.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           There you are.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm.
          Silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. She
          brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away
          loose silt and stones.
                         
          The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps.
                         
          Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to
          keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears.
                         
          In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its
          outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
                         
          Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Here.
           4.
                         
                         
          A second excavator glides out of the dark.
                         
          At the controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary
          genius and archaeologist. Dark-haired and lean, with the
          rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers
          and a T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
                         
          He plays his floodlights over the obelisk.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Look at that.
                         
                         
          INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
                         
          Watts floats her excavator down the front of the obelisk.
          Scanning the alien text. Suddenly she stops. Grips the
          obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.
                         
                          WATTS
           You need to see this.
                         
           HOLLOWAY (V.O.)
           Coming.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA TRENCH
                         
          Holloway pilots his excavator expertly up to Watts's. Mates
          the two vehicles at their aft hatchways.
                         
                         
          INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
                         
          Behind Watts, a hatch opens with a splatter of water.
                         
          Holloway climbs in. Squeezes into her cockpit. A tight fit.
          He's distracted by her body, pressed so close - but she has
          eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.
                         
                          WATTS
           Same thing again.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           What do you see?
                         
                          WATTS

                          WATTS
           Can we raise this thing?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           (shakes his head)
           Hundreds of tons.
                         
                         
          EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY
                         
          A research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea. Bright sun.
                         
          In the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. The horizon
          is dominated by the VOLCANIC PEAK - the same peak we saw in
          the distance in the prologue.
                         
          Aboard the research vessel, cranes lift Watts and Holloway's
          excavators out of the sea and onto the deck.
                         
                         
          INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - AFT DECK - DAY
                         
          Under an awning, PRINTS of the obelisk's faces are stretched
          on the deck - fifteen feet long.
                         
          Watts and Holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in
          hand. Parsing, translating, calculating.
                         
          They're tanned, fit, the wind in their hair. The
          Mediterranean coast in the distance. It's an idyllic way to
          work. But they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand.
                         
                         
          AFT DECK - NIGHT
                         
          They're still at it. Lights illuminate the workspace. The
          obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations.
                         
          Holloway sits at a table. Watts sits on the marked-up prints.
          Both working through calculations on electronic slates.
                         
          Holloway looks up.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I have a solution. A single match.
                         
                          WATTS
           Me too. Checked it twice.
           6.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You first.
                         
          Watts holds up her slate: it displays a set of stellar
          coordinates. A detailed star map. Holloway holds up his own
          slate: an exact match. They lock eyes in electric excitement.
                         
                          WATTS
           What do we do now?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We go there.
                         
                         
          EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL (EARTH ORBIT)
                         
          A gleaming space station like a five-spoked wheel rotates
          grandly against the Pacific Ocean a thousand miles below.
          Black letters on the white metal read: WEYLAND'S WHEEL.
                         
          A round shuttlecraft approaches the station.
                         
                         
          INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (ZERO GRAVITY)
                         
          A spacecraft no bigger than a private jet.
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit strapped into acceleration chairs. The
          only two passengers aboard. New to space travel, Watts tears
          her eyes from the spectacle of Earth outside the window.
                         
          Holloway plays with a pen, batting it from hand to hand in
          the zero gravity.
                         
                          WATTS
           What's first? You do climate, I do
           genetics?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Archaeology first. Let our ancestors
           tell the tale.
                         
                          WATTS
           You think he's serious?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Serious enough to send his private
           shuttle.
                         
                          WATTS
           Weyland can send his shuttle out for
           pizza.

           Martin. If this meeting goes like the
           others, maybe we should...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It won't go like the others.
                         
                          WATTS
           How do you know?
                         
          Holloway plucks the pen from the air. He points out the
          window, where the crescent Moon shines like a toothy grin.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Heaven smiles on our enterprise.
                         
                         
          EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
                         
          The shuttle docks with the Wheel's hub - a perfect fit.
                         
                         
          INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - SPOKE ELEVATOR (ZERO GRAVITY)
                         
          A gleaming capsule elevator with windows to the stars.
                         
          Holloway and Watts float weightlessly inside, moving from
          handhold to handhold. The door closes.
                         
          Watts grabs Holloway by the collar. Pulls them roughly
          together. They kiss. Not for the first time. They have a way.
                         
          Watts's hair and clothing float free: she's a naiad in
          Holloway's arms.
                         
                         
          EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
                         
          The elevator descends along the spoke to the rim.
                         
                         
          INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - RIM - FOYER
                         
          A luxurious lobby. Tasteful lighting. Eames-era furniture in
          wood and chrome: the past's vision of the future.
                         
          At the rim, the Wheel's rotation supplies gravity. An
          elevator door opens. Watts and Holloway step out - Holloway
          with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder.
                         
          The floor is the outer surface of the Wheel: in both
          directions it curves upward out of sight.
                         
          The walls are all windows: on one side, Earth rotates lazily.
          On the other, a wheeling field of stars.

          DAVID, an android, stands waiting for them. He's cunningly
          built, but no one would mistake him for a real human being.
                         
                          DAVID
           Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name
           is DAVID.
                         
                          WATTS
           Hello, DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you.
                         
          He strides off across the foyer. Watts and Holloway exchange
          a wondering glance and follow.
                         
                         
                         EXHIBIT HALL
                         
          DAVID leads past models of planets, moons and asteroids.
          Holographic labels and data swirl around them.
                         
                          DAVID
           These are all the planetary bodies on
           which Weyland Industries has mining
           claims.
                         
          The end of the hall is dominated by a huge globe of Mars.
          Markings indicate widespread surface activity.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           How is that going? The terraforming.
                         
                          WATTS
           They say you're getting diminishing
           returns. It's not working.
                         
                          DAVID
           It's the greatest engineering project
           ever attempted. Challenges are
           inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a
           determined man.

          PETER WEYLAND sits behind a mahogany desk. He's a Warren
          Buffet type: a country sage, horse-sense and hard knocks. He
          might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy.
           9.
                         
                         
          Behind him stands DIRECTOR LYDIA VICKERS, a slim woman of 45
          in a costly business suit. Shrewd and watchful. Once a great
          beauty, she now trades in ruthlessness.
                         
          DAVID stands against the wall.
                         
          Watts and Holloway settle into chairs in front of Weyland -
          Holloway holding the metal folio.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Professor Holloway. Ms. Watts.
                         
                          WATTS

                          WEYLAND
           Forgive me. Peter Weyland.
                         
          He notices Watts looking curiously at DAVID. He smiles.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Ah. DAVID here's a prototype. Our 80
           series. One of a kind for now, but if
           he performs, he will be legion.
           (his smile fades)
           What do you want here?
                         
          Holloway looks at him, startled.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We sent you a prospectus that...
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Assume I know nothing.
                         
          Holloway swallows. Lays the metal folio on Weyland's desk.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I'm an archaeologist.
                         
          He touches a tiny remote. Holographs appear in the air over
          Weyland's desk: the folio is a three-dimensional imager.
                         
          Pictures of a younger Holloway in the field: excavating ruins
          in Egypt, China, Peru, Greece.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           In my studies I discovered a pattern I
           couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred
           years, sudden advances in agriculture,
           tool use, technology. Inventions.
           Something caused a great leap forward.
           Every eleven centuries. The pattern
           holds as far back as our data goes.

           of my work.
                         
          Weyland nods. Holloway glances at Watts and forges on.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Dr. Watts was a student of mine.
                         
          Watts touches her own remote. The holographic display turns
          to scientific diagrams. Images of a very young and beautiful
          Watts in the laboratory.
                         
                          WATTS
           I was analyzing historical changes in
           human DNA. I found the same pattern.
           Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new
           information in the genome of the human
           race. All over the world. Evolution
           can't do that. Something was changing
           us. Changing the DNA of our species.

          Behind Weyland, Vickers can't suppress a scowl of disdain.
                         
                          VICKERS
           You mean aliens.
                         
          A beat. The others had forgotten Vickers was there.

           Once you know what you're looking for,
           it's amazing how the evidence falls
           into place.
                         
          Photographs flicker through the display: Holloway and Watts
          in the field, excavating new sites. Intimately close.
                         
          Their finds: columns of writing on stone tablets in Egypt,
          China, Cambodia, Peru. Patterns of lines, curves, and dots.

           This is the writing of the Engineers.
           We've found it on every continent. And

           location of a single star in our sky.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Which star?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We're keeping that confidential for
           now. But that's where we want to go.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           You want me to pay for an interstellar
           research expedition!
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It's a chance to be part of a
           revolution in scientific...
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Don't sell me, professor. You've been
           turned down by every university and
           government agency under the sun.
           Nobody's going to gamble that kind of
           money on your hunch.
                         
          Holloway deflates. Watts winces. This is a bloodbath.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Nobody but me.
                          (HE GRINS)
           I've read your research.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's impossible. Our research is-
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Quantum encoded on secure servers,
           yeah. We have an A.I. division, you
           should know. Doing impressive things.
           (he leans across the desk)
           I know which star you're wishing on.
                         
          The scientists stare at Weyland.
                         
                          WATTS
           You're bluffing.
           12.
                         
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Zeta Two Reticuli.
                         
          He regards their shocked faces with satisfaction.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           You know how I got this rich? I ask
           myself: what does God spend his time
           doing? And I go and do that.
                         
          Watts laughs incredulously. Stifles it. Weyland's not joking.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Biotechnology was good to me. Fusion
           power. Lately doing well with gravity
           systems.
                         
          He swivels his chair toward the window. Earth shines outside.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           But what's the first thing God did?
                         
                          WATTS
           He made the Heaven and the Earth.
                         
          Weyland jabs a finger at her like she's won a carnival prize.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           That's what I'm talking about. You
           left out my favorite part. The piece
           about Earth. DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           For eons, Earth's climate swung from
           hothouse to ice age. Explosions of
           life, then mass extinctions. But
           twelve thousand years ago the swings
           stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a
           period of anomalous tranquility. The
           rise of civilization began only then.
                         
          Holloway and Watts stare at DAVID with new appreciation.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's right.
                         
                          WATTS
           And that change coincides with a visit
           by the Engineers. They didn't just
           change us. They changed our world.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           That's the piece I mean. Engineering
           Earth. God stuff.
           13.
                         
                         
          He swivels back to his desk. Rummages in a drawer.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           My people checked your science. They
           say it's solid.
                         
          He pulls a thick contract out. Drops it in front of Holloway.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           I'll give you your expedition. Ship
           and crew, supplies, support. One
           condition.
                         
          Holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man
          double-checking a lottery ticket. His voice is husky:
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           What's that?
                         
                          WEYLAND
           You get the discovery. Control of the
           site. But any technology you find?
           Anything at all. That's mine.
                         
          Holloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract.
          Riffles the pages of small-print legalese.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           You take DAVID with you. My eyes and
           ears. And Vickers...you're going too.
                         
          Vickers stares at Weyland in shock.
                         
                         
                         WHITE LANDSCAPE
                         
          A glittering formation of white crystals. Diamond on diamond.
                         
          The structures grow more complex as the view widens. Leaves
          and branches of crystal. A shimmering field of white jewels.
                         
          A landscape of white crystals, smooth as snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. DEEP SPACE
                         
          A black void shot with stars, far from any sun.
                         
          A sturdy prospecting ship forges through space, travel-worn
          but built to last. It carries the Weyland Industries logo.
          The name painted on its hull is MAGELLAN.
           14.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          The ship's nerve center and control room. Six control
          stations, empty and quiet. Interior lights dimmed to blue.
                         
          The entire forward bulkhead of the Bridge is a window: wall
          to wall, floor to ceiling.
                         
          At the window stands the android DAVID.
                         
          He gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity.
          After a long moment he turns away. Massive shutters close
          over the window as he walks off.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          DAVID walks the ship's long central corridor. The ship is
          silent. The lights dimmed to blue. He is alone.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          A long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi,
          six on each side. Sleep freezers. Inside each freezer: the
          shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost.
                         
          DAVID walks through the compartment, surveying the sleepers.
                         
                         
                         WORKROOM
                         
          DAVID sits at a display table, moving intricate technical
          documents across the surface with waves of his hands.
                         
          His eyes intent on his work. If he is reading, then he`s
          reading at a speed no human could match.
                         
                         
                         WHITE LANDSCAPE
                         
          We pull away from the frosted crystalline horizon, the smooth
          white curves like snowy fields. Form becomes clear.
                         
          It's the body of a woman. It's Watts.
                         
                         
          INT. HYPERSLEEP FREEZER
                         
          Watts lies asleep in her underwear in a plexiglass freezer.
          Pale. Frost on her skin. Venus sculpted in ice. There are IV
          lines in her elbows and ankles.
           15.
                         
                         
          Shapes move into view beyond her, outside the freezer. FACES.
          Pressed to the glass.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          All of the freezers are open and empty, save two. Holloway
          lies in one. In the next, Watts. Three men in blue coveralls
          crouch beside Watts's freezer, staring inside.
                         
          They are DOWNS, 30, a lean fidgety crewman. STILLWELL, 40, a
          sturdy fellow with the geniality of a labrador. And KAMAROV,
          26, whose dark, brooding air belongs to a man twice his age.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Look at that.
                         
          Kamarov opens the lid of Watt's freezer. Leans over her.
          Watts stirs in her sleep, a drowsy angel.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           She wakes up slow.
                         
          Watts wakes to find three men looming above her. Disoriented,
          she pulls away. Tangles her hands in her IV lines.
                         
           HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
           Get out of there!
                         
          Holloway's voice cracks like a whip. The crewmen jump back.
                         
          Holloway sits up in the next freezer over. He yanks the IV
          lines out of his arms and legs. Climbs out of the freezer.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Just looking.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Give us a moment, will you?
                         
          The crewmen file out: Stillwell sheepishly, Downs and Kamarov
          surly. Holloway goes to Watts. Gently removes the IV lines
          from her ankles while she plucks the ones from her arms.
                         
                          WATTS
           I'm out of sorts. Sorry.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Never worry.
                         
          He helps her up.
           16.
                         
                         
          INT. MESS ROOM
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit at a table, both a bit hung over. They
          wear civilian clothes. Warmly dressed, they still look cold.
                         
          They nurse mugs of coffee and nibble packaged snack bars.
          Watts hunches over, shivering.
                         
                          WATTS
           My head's buzzing.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You just slept two and a half years.
           It'll pass.
                         
                          WATTS
           Like you've done this before.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I've read all about it.
                         
          Two ship's officers enter the room wearing blue coveralls
          with rank insignia: GLASSE, 45, a stocky man with thick black
          hair, and BRICK, 50, a bald man with a bristling mustache.
                         
          They look at Watts and Holloway with little pleasure.
                         
                          BRICK
           Sleep okay?
                         
                          WATTS
           Yes, thanks...
                         
                          GLASSE
           Captain'll see you now.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
                         
          CAPTAIN JANEK, 45, sits at his desk. With his bristling beard
          and powerful build he has a swashbuckling look, like the
          captain of a whaling ship.
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit on a steel bench in front of him.
                         
          He sits scanning his orders: a plastic packet with Weyland
          Industries logos, cracked open. Watermarked papers inside.
                         
                          JANEK
           Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed
           already. A hundred years ago.
                         
                          WATTS
           By an unmanned probe. Very crude.

                          JANEK
           No Earthlike planets.
                         
                          WATTS
           No.
                         
                          JANEK
           So what are you looking for?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Proof of the Engineers' existence.

           Confirmation of Professor Holloway's
           theories would change everything.
           There'd be science before Holloway and
           science after.
                         
          Janek rubs his face wearily with his hands.
                         
                          JANEK
           Your ticket. I'll put the ship where
           you want. Run your scans.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Captain, your crew's been up for a
           week. We could've used the time. Why'd
           you wait to wake us?
                         
                          JANEK
           Better for discipline.
           (off their silence)
           Men ship out as prospectors for one
           reason: the percentage. Find a gold
           mine or a habitable planet, and you're
           set for life.
           (he laughs bitterly)
           But this contract says no percentage.
           No bounty. Just triple pay. The men
           aren't happy.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You unhappy too?
                         
                          JANEK
           I'm always unhappy.
                         
          He stands. Presses his palm against a wall panel. A safe
          opens. He pulls out a massive pistol in a gunbelt. Tosses the
          orders into the safe. Lays the gun atop them and locks it up.
           18.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          Holloway and Watts take possession of their cabin: a simple
          but spacious room with twin beds and a window to the stars.
                         
          They drop duffel bags on the bed.
                         
          Holloway surveys the arrangement. Frowns. He releases the
          magnets that lock the beds down. Slides the beds together.
                         
                         
          INT. SCIENTISTS' WORKROOM - DAY
                         
          Holloway and Watts set up their workspace - a central display
          table and huge display surfaces on the walls. Fascinating
          documents slide under their fingertips: an Engineer alphabet.
          Ancient art. Climate and genetic data.
                         
          DAVID appears in the doorway.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you.
                         
                          DAVID
           I trust your database is in order. I
           set it up myself.
                         
                          WATTS
           All's well, I think.
                         
          DAVID turns to go. Hesitates in the doorway.
                         
                          DAVID
           I should tell you: the time you spent
           sleeping, I spent studying your
           research.
                         
          Holloway and Watts look at the android, his words sinking in.
                         
                          WATTS
           You studied our work for two and a
           half years.
                         
                          DAVID
           It's quite a data set.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           So you've seen everything. Well. What
           do you think?
                         
          DAVID glances over the documents displayed around the room.
           19.
                         
                         
                          DAVID
           Your hypothesis is...bold. The
           audacity of it. Your climate data's
           undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was
           engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic
           studies are equally conclusive. Pulses
           of cultural change are harder to
           prove, but even there your case is
           strong. I believe in your "Engineers."
                         
                         
                         BREAK ROOM
                         
          A utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches and table bolted to
          the deck. Seated here are two Weyland Industries technicians:
                         
          ANDREW CHANCE, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial
          bearing and a bristling salt-and-pepper mustache.
                         
          MONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her
          hair pulled severely back. A physicist and chemist.
                         
          They wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate
          intelligence and competence. These are pros.
                         
          DAVID leads Holloway and Watts past the break room. Holloway
          spots the technicians. Strides in to greet them.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms.
           Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts.
                         
          Watts and the technicians exchange greetings.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           About the materials I gave you. Some
           of the technical aspects...
                         
                          CHANCE
           We'll handle our end of the job.
                         
                          RAVEL
           If there is a job.
                         
          Holloway blinks at her. Chance explains, not unkindly:
                         
                          CHANCE
           We only have a job if you find
           something.
           20.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Holloway and Watts follow the imperturbable DAVID down a
          steel corridor to Vickers's cabin door.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          An open-plan cabin like an urban loft apartment. Watts and
          Holloway follow DAVID inside. Vickers rises to meet them.
                         
          The walls are industrial steel - but the floors are lushly
          carpeted, the furniture opulent. A king-sized bed, a mahogany
          desk, a dining table.
                         
          Gleaming machines ensure Vickers never need step outside: a
          private hypersleep freezer, an autokitchen, a medical pod.
                         
                          WATTS
           Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's
           only ten of those things on Earth! I
           guess nine, now.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't
           compromise my standard of living. He
           accommodated me.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I know, I had to cut my manifest. This
           used to be the number four cargo bay.
                         
                          VICKERS
           What can I do for you, Professor?
                         
          Holloway gestures with the slate he's brought with him.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We're about to reach the system
           periphery. I thought you'd want to see
           the search protocols we -
                         
                          VICKERS
           No. I was set to be the next CEO of
           Weyland Industries. Then you came
           along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this.
           So here I am. Out of the running.
           I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask
           me to play along.
                         
                          WATTS
           But when you get back...
           21.
                         
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'll be five years behind the curve.
           Out of touch. Over.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You might make the discovery of the
           ages.
                         
          Vickers looks at him as if she's dealing with a child.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           You don't believe in what we're doing.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough.
                         
          She walks them toward the door. Interview's over.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           Now we're out of communication, you
           can tell the crew what we're doing.
                         
                          WATTS
           They don't know? They volunteered.
                         
                          VICKERS
           They volunteered blind. Classified
           job, triple pay.
                         
                         
                         CARGO BAY
                         
          The crew - Brick, Glasse, Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov - sit
          on crates in an improvised lecture hall. Holloway and Watts
          in front of them. Janek at the back of the room.
                         
          A hologram shows ancient images of divine visitations. The
          crew is visibly spooked.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Aliens.
                         
                          GLASSE
           You shitting me?
                         
          Stillwell is staring at the frightening images: gods and
          titans towering over mortals.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I think all our mythologies are race-
           memories of the Engineers. Horus the
           Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from
           heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of
           smoke. The Engineers are the gods.
           22.
                         
                         
          Kamarov stiffens, smelling blasphemy.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           The mythology gods maybe. God is God.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Kamarov. Let him talk.
                         
          Stillwell's staring unhappily at the ancient images: gods
          towering over mortals, inhuman and terrifying.
                         
                          STILLWELL (CONT'D)
           So we're going to meet these things?
                         
                          WATTS
           We probably won't meet anyone. You'd
           expect a star-traveling race to
           generate radio or laser signals.
           Fusion drives and gravity drives have
           clear signatures. But Zeta Two
           Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers
           have gone missing on Earth.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           By the pattern, they should've come to
           Earth seventeen centuries ago. And
           again six centuries ago. But no sign.
           After twelve thousand years...they
           stopped coming.
                         
                          BRICK
           Why?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Exactly. Why?
                         
                          JANEK
           "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
           me?"
                         
          They turn. Janek grins at Holloway across the cargo bay.
                         
                          JANEK (CONT'D)
           Is that the question you've come light-
           years to answer?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Only my first question. I have many.
           23.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM)
                         
          The Magellan arrives at the periphery of the system. A
          distant star like Earth's Sun, surrounded by orbiting
          planets: mere sparks at this distance.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Outside the vast Bridge window, the star Zeta2 Reticuli
          burns, a cold beacon in the night. Downs, Glasse and Brick
          sit at consoles. Janek paces in front of the window.
                         
          Holloway and Watts enter - and gape at the view. Janek grins
          at their reaction.
                         
                          JANEK
           Welcome to Zeta Two Reticuli. Edge of
           the system. Open her eyes.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM)
                         
          The Magellan opens its eyes: two immense telescopes emerge
          from the ship. Irises open to expose huge lenses.
                         
          Antennae deploy: unfurling like wings, gleaming and vast.
          Sifting vacuum for any whisper of information.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE

          no more than bright stars.

          A heads-up display appears, overlaid on the glass. The sun is
          labeled ZETA2 RETICULI. Markers point out the planets and
          trace the ellipses of their orbits.
                         
          Like magic, the planets swell into colorful orbs, each

          varies from its agreeable tone.
                         
                          DAVID
           My design's not intended to convince.
           Simulating humanity is a complex task
           that diverts resources. My designers
           dispensed with that burden to optimize
           for intelligence.

           spaces and equipment designed for you.
           But I'm not so limited. I hear
           frequencies you can't hear. I see

           I move faster. Exert greater force.
                         
          The scientists look at DAVID in wonder.

          LV-426 is a gray moon shrouded in clouds. Behind it looms its
          father planet Epsilon, a lurid gas giant banded in red and
          gold, half swallowed in darkness.
                         
          The Magellan dives into a forced orbit around LV-426: rockets

           30.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Janek takes the helm. Guides the Magellan down a valley as if
          it were a helicopter. A pilot born.
                         
                          GLASSE
           Coming up on site seven.
                         
          They crest a mountain higher than Everest.
                         
          Before them stretches a dry barren plain. Scattered rocky
          peaks rise from the desert floor - an alien Monument Valley.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Nothing.
                         
          Holloway points to a smaller mountain peak. Oddly regular.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Look there.
                         
          Janek expertly swings the Magellan sideways. The Magellan
          circles the mount, nose pointed inward.
                         
          It revolves below the watchers: flat faces, clean edges - but
          cracked and timework. It glitters like coal.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Are we recording?
                         
          Glasse nods irritably. Of course they're recording.
                         
          Vickers stares at the pyramidal peak, nonplussed. Teetering
          on the brink of belief. Watts scans the data readouts.
                         
                          WATTS
           Tungsten, tantalum, aluminum. That
           could be technology.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Let's see the next one.
                         
                         
          EXT. LV-426 - SECOND PEAK
                         
          A second oddly regular peak, even more decrepit than the
          first, sits on the brink of a vast canyon. Landslides have
          eaten at its edges.
                         
          The Magellan purrs over the landscape, dwarfed by the scale.
          Drops between the canyon walls to circle the mount.
           31.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Holloway and Watts stare at the structure. Beginning to get
          over the shock. Thinking like scientists again.
                         
                          WATTS
           Identical, apart from weathering.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Could be a rock formation. Carbon
           crystallizes like that.
                         
          The scientists pay him no mind. They're past that.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Let's see the big one.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Janek pilots by instruments alone. Clouds obscuring the view.
                         
                          BRICK
           Closing on the major site...
                         
          The ship descends into clear air. A stunning panorama unfolds
          before them: craters, hundreds of meters across, connected by
          trenches. Like a pattern of crop-circles sunk in the rock.
                         
          In the middle of the central crater - a huge angular peak,
          larger than the others. The Magellan circles the site. It's
          awe-inspiring. Cryptic. Huge.
                         
          Holloway stares in rapture. Glances at Watts: she nods, eyes
          shining. She's with him.
                         
          The crew's still skeptical - but starting to wonder. They
          shake their heads and exchange looks.
                         
                          BRICK (CONT'D)
           No radio. No heat sources. Cold as the
           grave.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Nobody home.
                         
          Watts looks out at the timeworn peak. Its eroded facets.
                         
                          WATTS
           I don't think anybody's been home for
           a long time.
           32.
                         
                         
          EXT. CRATER COMPLEX - DAY
                         
          From the central crater, four canals extend outward like
          points of the compass. Some connect to smaller craters.
                         
          One canal peters out, flush with the desert floor.
                         
          The Magellan lands at the end of this canal - half a
          kilometer from the central crater.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          They stare out the window, down the wide straight canal at
          the pyramidal peak in the distance. Holloway looks around.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           All right. Let's move.
                         
          Janek glances at his instruments.
                         
                          JANEK
           There's only six hours of daylight
           left. Maybe you should hold off.
                         
          Watts looks at him incredulously.
                         
                          WATTS
           We've got that outside the windows and
           you want to wait `til tomorrow?
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK - DAY
                         
          The expedition party emerges from the airlocks - riding CARGO
          ROVERS, robotic vehicles just smart enough to carry their
          owners around, or follow along behind them.
                         
          The rovers' beds are loaded with gear; the explorers ride on
          running-board seats. All wear space suits.
                         
          Holloway drives the first rover with Watts beside him.
          Stillwell, Kamarov, and Downs in back.
                         
          DAVID drives the second rover with Milburn, Fifield, Chance
          and Ravel aboard.
                         
                          WATTS
           The air here will kill you, so keep an
           eye on your supply and watch your
           seals. Pathogen tests are clean.
           33.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Move slowly. Stay together. Don't
           touch anything. Things may be more
           fragile than they look - or more
           dangerous. There might be technologies
           operating here we don't understand.
                         
          The crew of the Magellan exchange uneasy looks. Still
          uncertain what to think.
                         
                         
          EXT. ENTRY CANAL - DAY
                         
          The trench grows deeper as they follow it toward the central
          crater - the pyramidal peak framed ahead of them like a
          monument on a triumphal avenue.
                         
          They cross a perpendicular canal. Glancing left and right,
          they see smaller craters with central peaks of their own.
                         
          They pass through the shadow of a high promontory of stone
          atop one bank of the canal.
                         
          We see - and they do not - that the far side of the
          promontory has a Sphinx-like FACE of monumental size. So
          eroded that its artificial nature is uncertain.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DAY
                         
          The crater floor is a vast enclosed plain. The pyramidal
          mount looms in the center - colossal in scale.
                         
          The rovers enter the crater, trailing plumes of dust. They
          circle the pyramid.
                         
          On the south face of the pyramid, an IRIS DOOR of many blades
          stands, easily fifty feet high. Seemingly made of the same
          basaltic stone as the pyramid itself. A huge construction.
                         
          The explorers are transfixed in awe. All skepticism banished.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Tell me that's a natural formation.
                          (HE GRINS)
           Undeniable proof of alien
           civilization. You were here on this
           day, thirty-one December, year of our
           Lord 2172. History will remember your
           names.
                         
          Watts stares at the iris. Its bottom-most blade is broken; it
          lies in rubble at the foot of the door. A dark knife-like
          aperture leads into the pyramid.
           34.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           The door's open.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Janek and Vickers watch the explorers' progress in the main
          holographic display: their tinny voices echoing over the comm
          link. At the sight of the huge iris door in the pyramid, both
          Janek and Vickers stare in blank astonishment.
                         
                          JANEK
           Son of a bitch. They were right.
                         
          He turns to stare out the window at the pyramid's peak.
                         
          Vickers turns and slips out of the Bridge. Hurries away.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers strides through her quarters. On the far wall there
          are two small doors.
                         
          She opens the first: steps into a luxurious bathroom. Washes
          a pill down with a tumbler of water.
                         
          Returns to her cabin and opens the second small door.
                         
                         
          SECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A chamber walled with steel panels. A deep hum of ventilation
          and power: there's a lot of technology here.
                         
          She turns to a console beside the door. Flips a row of
          switches. The hum deepens. Hidden mechanisms stir to life.
                         
                         
          EXT. PYRAMID - IRIS DOOR
                         
          On foot, explorers press inside - Holloway and Watts in the
          lead. Their flashlights cut into the gloom.
                         
          The robotic rovers follow them: their six-wheeled chassis
          with independent suspension trundling over the rubble
          barrier, sure-footed as goats.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - ANTECHAMBER
                         
          Dark and cavernous. Weak daylight slants in.

          The explorers press into the darkness on foot - the cargo
          rovers' headlights flashing on. They move through a dark
          cathedral space, empty and bare.
                         
          DAVID looks around in fascination, his eyes raking the walls.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn. Here.
                         
          His voice trembles with urgency. He shines light on the rock.
          Symbols engraved on the dark surface. Dots, lines and arcs.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The writing of the Engineers.
           Conclusive connection.
                         
          DAVID stands beside them. Stares at the alien writing.
                         
                          DAVID
           Congratulations, Professor Holloway.
                         
          Watts passes her light over the writing, recording it. They
          move on into the dark.
                         
          DAVID lingers. Reading.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - VARIOUS PASSAGES
                         
          The interior is a labyrinth. Corridors big as railway tunnels
          intersecting and diverging.
                         
          The explorers wend their way deeper. Several carry map units,
          whose holographic displays render three-dimensional maps that
          expand as they explore.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - MASSIVE CHAMBER
                         
          Holloway leads the explorers deeper into the complex. The
          motors of the cargo rovers whine and growl.
                         
          DAVID trails the others, eyes raking the blank walls as if he
          sees something there. He reaches out. Passes his hand through
          the air as if grasping a cobweb.
                         
          A STRANGE RUMBLING NOISE sounds down the corridor, freezing
          them. Holloway sweeps his light that way. The sound comes
          again: a DEMONIC VOICE speaking some unearthly language.
                         
          Watts looks at Holloway - but his eyes are focused on the
          dark ahead. He moves forward. A beat. The others follow.
           36.
                         
                         
          An APPARITION appears before them. A PALE, LUMINOUS GIANT
          fifteen feet tall, with hollow eyes and a grotesque snout. It
          strides toward them. Speaks in a sonorous voice.
                         
          Pandemonium.
                         
          Watts backpedals involuntarily. Seeing Holloway stand his
          ground, she reaches out to him in a panic.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Martin!
                         
          But Holloway doesn't budge. Stares at the Apparition in
          fascination. Everyone else scatters - except DAVID, who
          stands stock-still by the wall.
                         
          Watts watches as the Apparition walks right up to Holloway.
          Disappears with a sizzle of static as Holloway experiences
          the creature passing through him.
                         
          Silence. Watts returns to Holloway's side. Stillwell and
          Downs are huddled on the deck. Milburn and Fifield have
          fallen back down the passageway.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Christ. Christ!
                         
                          RAVEL
           It wasn't real.
                         
                          MILBURN
           We all saw it.
                         
          Unseen by the others, DAVID reaches out and repeats his
          gesture in the air.
                         
          A rumbling sound down the corridor, as before. Moments later,
          the Apparition appears round the corner again. They stand
          their ground: the ghostly giant strides toward them, exactly
          as before, and disappears with a crackle.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Recording?
                         
                          FIFIELD
           No more. I'm out.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Fifield. Get a grip.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           I'm a prospector. You find a load of
           bauxite, I'm your man. But not this.
           37.
                         
                         
                          MILBURN
           I should go with him. Buddy system.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
                          (DISGUSTED)
           Fine.
                         
          He hauls a heavy rolling case out of the cargo rover.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           You can deploy the drones. Drop them
           in the first or second nexus on your
           way back.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Give us a rover.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           And half our gear? It's no more than a
           mile. You can walk it.
                         
          Sulking, Milburn takes the rolling case. The remaining
          explorers watch Fifield and Milburn backtrack into the dark.
                         
                         
          CORE CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          Holloway and Watts lead their party up to a massive door,
          sealed tight. In design and scale, undeniably important.
          Holloway glances at his map.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           This should lead to the core of the
           pyramid.
                         
                          WATTS
           Jack it open? Or cut through?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Let's do as little damage as we can.
                         
          Ravel waves a sensor over the wall.
                         
                          RAVEL
           There's power. Current flowing in the
           wall.
                         
          Chance begins to inspect the frame of the door.
                         
                          CHANCE
           Maybe we can hack it. Has to be a
           mechanism...
           38.
                         
                         
          DAVID looks as if they fail to see something obvious. He
          points at a spot on the wall beside the massive slab.
                         
                          DAVID
           Pull up a rover. I want to get up
           there.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DAY
                         
          Janek stands at the window, looking down the long canal at
          the distant pyramid.
                         
          The ship's powerful imaging systems stream data: stereoscopic
          feeds from the explorers' flashlights; a map that grows as
          they explore. The maze under the pyramid drawn in light.
                         
          A globe of LV-426 blooms with terrain and weather data as the
          satellites feed the ship information.
                         
          Vickers appears at Janek's side.

           It's my operation, isn't it?
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - HUB
                         
          A junction where multiple passageways converge.
                         
          Milburn and Fifield trudge into the space, trundling the
          probe cases behind them. Tunnels lead away in all directions.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           What do you think?
                         
                          MILBURN
           Grand Central Station.
                         
          They open the case. CAMERA PROBES tumble out: spheres the
          size of softballs, studded with lenses and sensors.
                         
          Tiny lights come on as the probes awaken. They roll off,
          dispersing to investigate every passageway. Bumbling into
          walls and pillars, reversing. Exploring by random walk.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Let's check the feed. Gimme the map.
                         
                          MILBURN
           You had the map unit.
           39.
                         
                         
                          FIFIELD
           You don't have the map?
                         
          They stare at each other.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Are you serious?
                         
          He trudges back the way they came, in disgust.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           Come on.
                         
                         
          CORE CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          DAVID stands on top of one of the cargo rovers. He's cut a
          hole in the wall beside the door, high up: he works with
          probes in the mechanisms inside.
                         
                          DAVID
           Looks like a three-state switch.
                         
          A deep BOOM, echoing inside the ancient walls. Nothing moves.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           One moment...
                         
          He moves a control. BOOM. The immense door begins to rise.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER
                         
          The vast central chamber of the pyramid. An immense space.
                         
          Holloway walks in, his flashlight searching. Watts hurries
          after. The others follow, rovers tagging along.
                         
          A colossal structure stands in the center of the chamber,
          convoluted and strange. A mechanism. Chasms yawn in the floor
          all around it, their depths lost in darkness.
                         
          The explorers enter, rovers in train. They lift their eyes:
          hundreds of feet above them they see the pyramid's apex from
          within. A SHAFT OF DIFFUSE LIGHT penetrates the pyramid
          somewhere near the peak.
                         
                          RAVEL
           This is something, now.
                         
                          DAVID
           Yes. Yes, it is.
           40.
                         
                         
          The android's awareness is keyed to a high pitch. He seems to
          read meaning in the inscrutable structures all around them.
                         
          Holloway hauls a drone case out of the rover. Two dozen
          spherical drones tumble out, wake up, and roll off into the
          dark. They are nimble, hopping curbs and skirting chasms.
                         
          Watts looks at her atmosphere sensor. Astonished.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. This air's breathable.
                         
          The core chamber brightens as the sun outside moves into
          alignment. The shaft of light perfectly centered.
                         
          A vast SIGH as if the pyramid itself is breathing.
                         
          A fat drop of water falls on Watts's glove. She looks up in
          surprise. Another falls on her visor. And then it's raining
          inside the pyramid.
                         
          Water trickles into the chasms, inundating the mossy growths
          that cling to the walls.
                         
          Holloway looks at Watts with a little boy's grin.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Miracles and wonders!
                         
          The shaft of light moves on. The core chamber dims slightly.
          The rainfall stops as suddenly as it started.
                         
          The explorers follow the main path around the periphery of
          the chamber, past a gallery of mysterious machines.
                         
          There are marvels in the shadows. Cells in the dark apparatus
          open on startling deposits of color: translucent alabaster
          flutes. Honeycombs of pure gold. Matrices of crystal.
                         
          Watts waves a scanning instrument as she walks.
                         
                          WATTS
           Intense field readings. Huge power
           sources here.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - RAMP
                         
          They arrive at a wide opening in the floor. A strange ramp
          curves downward - its floor segmented and saw-toothed.
                         
          A bafflement: it's not a staircase. Not an escalator. No
          moving parts. No rails or tracks.
           41.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Space below us. A big space.
                         
          As they stand looking, a probe bumbles up to the opening and
          goes bounding down the ramp. Watts laughs.
                         
                          WATTS
           How does this work?
                         
          She begins to descend on foot. Holloway behind her.
          Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov grudgingly follow.
                         
          But DAVID looks away across the cavernous chamber - fixated
          on the central crystal. He beckons Ravel and Chance to follow
          him, and walks away.
                         
          Ravel and Chance look at each other in astonishment.
          Uncertainly, they follow DAVID.
                         
                         
                         LOWER PASSAGE
                         
          Holloway, Watts, and the crewmen reach the bottom of the
          ramp, breathing hard. A cargo rover trundles down after them.
                         
          They look back up. The ramp above them is empty.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Ravel. Chance. Where've you gone?
           DAVID! Where are you?
           (to Watts, indignantly)
           They didn't come down!
                         
          But Watts is staring through an archway. Transfixed.
                         
                          WATTS
           Look.
                         
          She walks in. Holloway follows.
                         
                         
                         CONTROL CONCOURSE
                         
          A passageway punctuated by alcoves as big as band-shells.
                         
          In each alcove stands a biomechanical apparatus - shaped from
          the same dark material as the pyramid itself. Each apparatus
          implies by its design that a giant is meant to fit inside it.
                         
          Holloway and Watts walk the concourse, playing their lights
          over the dark machinery. Their footsteps echo.
           42.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           Do you see, the size of them? Like
           that ghost we saw...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It wasn't a ghost. Where are the
           others? I don't want to go back up.
                         
          Watts fiddles with her suit's comm controls. Listening.
                         
                          WATTS
           They switched to channel three. I hear
           them talking. They're okay.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We should stay together.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - BLIND CORRIDOR
                         
          Milburn and Fifield are lost. They bumble through the dark.

           This is not the same place.

          Holloway and Watts round a corner and stop in their tracks.
          Kamarov, Stillwell, and Downs almost run into them.
                         
          The scientists stand frozen.
                         
          In front of them lies a dead giant. An ENGINEER.
                         
          If he were standing, he would be fifteen feet tall.
                         
          He is roughly human in shape. Barrel-chested. Withered to the
          bones. There are bulky protrusions fused with his flesh: hard
          to say whether they are equipment or parts of his body.
           43.
                         
                         
          His head, lolling to one side, is severed from his body.
                         
          His eyes seem to be covered by goggles; but if so then the
          goggles are fused with his skull. An elephantine proboscis,
          severed now, once connected to a protrusion on his hip.
                         
          The giant lies frozen in a convulsion of agony. His jaw
          gaping in a silent scream. His corpse is marred by hideous
          wounds: slashes that cut through bone.
                         
          The explorers move closer. Speechless.

          He lifts his light. Beyond the dead giant, a vision of Hell:
                         
          A dozen DEAD ENGINEERS lie heaped against a sealed door.
          Twisted in postures of torment, murdered in the attempt to
          escape. All bear horrific wounds.
                         
          Scene of an ancient massacre.

          Watts joins Holloway beside the dead Engineer. Touches the
          corpse in her own turn. It's hard as stone: ossified. She
          traces the ancient, terrible wounds.

          One of the Magellan's satellites hurtles along, high above
          the moon's atmosphere. It passes over the terminator line
          between the night side and day side.
                         
          Through the clouds below, a lightning-laced storm front rolls
          across LV-426 like a wave.

          Watts rides in back, securing a bulky payload under a tarp on
          the cargo deck. Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov clinging
          miserably beside her. Watts looks back:
                         
          A massive storm front chases them. A tidal wave of dust shot
          through with lightning. Gale-force winds tear at the ground.
          Lightning lashes the pyramid and the crater wall.
                         
          Reaching the Magellan, they see the other rover already in
          the airlock lift. DAVID, Ravel, and Chance aboard.

          almost into the opposite wall. Watts leaps down.
                         
          The storm wall catches up to them. Screaming winds rip
          through the lift. Dust fills the air. Visibility plunges
          toward zero.

          She pulls at the tarp. It tears halfway free - and fills with
          wind, snapping taut with such violence that Watts is hurled
          out into the storm.

          metal stanchion. Clings, the wind knocked out of her. Ears
          ringing. Nothing but static in her headset.

          With inhuman reflexes DAVID reacts. Grabs a tether. Latches
          it to his suit. Locks it to an anchor point on the wall.
          Dives into the storm. A ballet nearly too fast to follow.

          DAVID lets the wind take him. Skids across the ground,
          controlling his trajectory. He hits the stanchion where Watts
          is lodged with a CLANG as if he were made of iron.
                         
          Watts stares at him in mute astonishment.
                         
          He locks her suit to his. Activates the tether unit's winch.
          It whirs, reeling them in through the hurricane.

          toward the safety of the ship.
                         
          The crewmen bundle the rover's tarp-wrapped cargo into a
          sealed dumbwaiter that rises independently into the ship.

          nod and vanishes into the ship.

          All hands present excepting the two missing men. Janek plays
          his squeeze box, its archaic music filling the air. Tired and
          exuberant, the men sway and dance mockingly.
                         
          Holloway has a champagne bottle open in each hand. He fills
          steel cups left and right.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           My friends. What we do here marks the
           greatest achievement of our species.
           Contact with another civilization.
           Humanity came of age today, on this
           moon. You were there.
           (raises his glass)
           To history.
                         
          They raise cups and drink. Even the crew moved by the moment.
          But Janek smiles crookedly and toasts again.
           49.
                         
                         
                          JANEK
           To Milburn and Fifield. The first
           human beings to freak out, get lost,
           and sleep in their suits in the ruins
           of an alien civilization.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID CATACOMBS - NIGHT
                         
          A vast dark maze. Milburn and Fifield grope their way through
          the dark with flashlights. The storm howls outside.
                         
                          MILBURN
           What are you looking for?
                         
                          FIFIELD
           (groping along the wall)
           Someplace things can't come at us.
                         
                          MILBURN
           What's gonna come at us?
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE - NIGHT
                         
          DAVID stands beside Vickers at her holography terminal. He
          lays his hand on over a signal plate - and the terminal
          lights up with a three-dimensional image.
                         
          The core chamber of the pyramid, from DAVID's point of view.
                         
          It's apparent that DAVID's eyes see more than human eyes do.
          He seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as
          visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene.
                         
          The structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated
          patterns of energy. This is incomprehensible technology.
                         
                          DAVID
           The core of the pyramid. You see.
                         
          Vickers goes rigid, looking at it: avarice in her eyes.
                         
                          VICKERS
           We're going to protocol two.
                         
                          DAVID
           I understand.
                         
                         
                         LABORATORY
                         
          A high-tech science facility behind glass. Watts and
          Holloway, in lab gloves and smocks, open the dumbwaiter:
           50.
                         
                         
          An ENGINEER'S HEAD rises into view, ghoulish and elephantine.
          Vapor rises from it. A readout blinks: STERILIZED.
                         
          They lift it onto the steel table. It takes both of them.
                         
          They pass scanners over the skull. Images accumulate and
          rotate on the laboratory displays. X-ray and ultrasound.
                         
          Holloway leans close to study an X-ray image. He almost seems
          to see a ghostly second face...
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Look.
                         
          She traces the head with an ultrasound probe: under the
          vibrations a seam opens up around the edge of the face.
                         
          She gets a fingertip into the seam. Works with a probe. Pries
          away the long-dead Engineer's mask. It comes free.
                         
          The visage revealed is human, except for its giant scale.
                         
          White-skinned. Earless. Hairless. Withered but beautiful as a
          Greek statue. Eyes closed. An expression of suffering on its
          face. Watts drops the ultrasound probe in shock.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           They look like us.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We look like them. Genesis 1:27. "And
           God created man in his own image. In
           his own image created He him."
                         
          Vickers and DAVID stand outside the lab window, staring in at
          the god's head. Vickers looks shaken. DAVID, fascinated.
                         
          Watts covers her nose in revulsion. A horrible stench: The
          Engineer head begins to disintegrate in front of them. Flesh
          oozing, skin peeling. Accelerated decay.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           It's breaking down.
                         
                          WATTS
           Formaldehyde!
                         
          Urgently they ransack cabinets and storage rooms. Watts finds
          a clear plastic drum and dumps its contents. Holloway drags
          five-gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet.
                         
          DAVID watches through the window, almost amused.
           51.
                         
                         
                          DAVID
           Mortal after all.
                         
          They lift the rotting head into the drum, retching. Fingers
          skidding in putrefaction.
                         
          They pour formaldehyde over it. As soon as the head is
          immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and
          smocks, scrubbing their hands.
                         
          The god's head sits in its murky vat, shedding skin and tofu-
          like chunks of white flesh. The noble face disintegrating.
                         
          Watts and Holloway stare at it, breathing hard from their
          work. Vickers flicks on the intercom from outside the window.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Your cadaver's interesting. But I'm
           more interested in the machinery in
           the pyramid. The core chamber. What do
           you think it does?
                         
          Watts stares at Vickers incredulously.
                         
                          WATTS
           How could anyone know...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I know what it does.
                         
          Silence. Holloway looks at Vickers wearily, as if he's seen
          this conversation coming. He glances at Watts.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Think. What we've seen. What we know.
                         
          Watts rises to the challenge. Thinking on her feet.
                         
                          WATTS
           Twenty-four pyramids scattered around
           the moon's equator. Massive power
           supplies. Vents in the walls.
           Atmosphere changes. Breeder tanks...
           (she's got it)
           The pyramids are terraforming
           machines.
                         
          Holloway grins, exuberant. His theory playing out perfectly.
          He doesn't see Vickers stiffen. Her hands curling into fists.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's why Earth's ancient cultures
           built pyramids: in imitation of the
           gods.

                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Twelve thousand years ago, beings from
           the sky set pyramids on the Earth and
           transformed the world. That's what
           they were doing here - before their
           civilization failed.
                         
          Watts stares at the head in its tank. The severed neck.
                         
                          WATTS
           It didn't fail. It was wiped out.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - INSECT CHAMBER
                         
          Milburn and Fifield have bunked down in a new chamber: they
          slouch against a wall. Milburn sweeps the room with his
          headlamp. Stoops to lift something into the light.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Look at this!
                         
          A CENTIPEDE, three feet long and thick as man's thumb. Its
          hard shell is gray. It has a hammer-head like a shark.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Jesus! Put it down!
                         
          He leaps back, wild-eyed.
                         
          Milburn laughs at him. Lets the eyeless centipede wind its
          segmented body around his space-suited arm.
                         
          In the flat face, a white vertical slit appears. Changes
          quickly to a horizontal position; opens enough to suggest a
          mouth. Milburn doesn't notice this development.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Relax. Your suit's bug-proof. Hell,
           it's bulletproof.
                         
          The centipede spirals around his arm, glittering, its body
          moving in fluid waves. The blind head quests between his
          fingers. Milburn loses his nerve as the thing's mouth
          suddenly gapes wide as a shark's.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           That's enough.
                         
          He tries to pull it off.
                         
          The centipede locks its segments together and digs in with
          its body. It might as well be made of iron.
           53.
                         
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
                          (PANICKING)
           Get it off! It's crushing me!
                         
          Fifield pulls out a utility knife. Cuts into the centipede's
          body behind its head.
                         
          A gout of greed ACID spills over Milburn's glove. Smoke rises
          as the acid quickly burns a hole through the material.
                         
          Milburn's shout of astonishment turns to a wail of agony.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           AHH! Help me! Christ!
                         
          The centipede snakes into the smoking hole in the glove.
          Crawls upward into Milburn's suit - toward his head.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - LABORATORY - NIGHT
                         
          Holloway stands studying the data displays: cross-sections of
          the Engineer's skull.
                         
          Watts scrutinizes the head itself, her nose an inch from the
          plastic tank. Not a pretty sight.
                         
          As she watches, a current in the formaldehyde peels away one
          gossamer eyelid. The revealed eye is black as obsidian,
          iridescent like opal. A jewel.
                         
          Fascinated, Watts pulls out a plastic case. Opens it to
          reveal a high-tech control unit with a screen. She pops open
          a plastic capsule: removes a tiny SEED PROBE, smaller than a
          grain of rice. Drops it into the vat.
                         
          Under her guidance, the seed probe swims to the severed neck.
          Burrows into the medulla oblongata toward the brain.
                         
          ON A SCREEN: In the probe's POV the medulla looks like a
          tunnel. The probe climbs along neural channels.
                         
          Another screen shows the probe's progress through the skull.
                         
          Glasse enters. Stands beside Holloway to watch Watts at work.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You won't get anything. Tissue's too
           degraded. Hmm. Brain chamber's
           massive, even proportionately.
                         
                          WATTS
           Neural paths are still conductive.
           54.
                         
                         
          The seed probe reaches the optic nerve of the exposed eye -
          and its POV fills with a vision of glory: a beautiful woman's
          face surrounded by a mystical nimbus of light. An angel.
                         
          Glasse and Holloway gasp. The woman in the blurry vision is
          Watts - as seen by the dead Engineer's eye.
                         
                          GLASSE
           Incredible.
                         
          The image dissolves into noise. Error messages flicker across
          the display. Watts sighs.
                         
                          WATTS
           Formaldehyde's killing the tissue.
                         
          Holloway stares at Watts, awe on his face.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Did you record that?
                         
                          WATTS
           Of course.
                         
                         
          AT A LAB TABLE
                         
          Watts dissects one of the Engineer's eyes - working
          underwater in a shallow tub of preservative. Glasse looks on
          avidly, an unabashed fan.
                         
          Watts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead -
          the lenses lowering and rising at need.
                         
          She bisects the apple-sized eyeball carefully and extracts
          the hard lens from behind the cornea. Holds the lens up to
          her eye. It is opalescent, almost luminous.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           The lens is where the phase shift
           happens.
                         
          The uncorrected view through the lens is blurry.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Glasse. I want to look through these
           lenses. Can you seal them and do the
           optical correction?
                         
          Glasse reaches out and plucks the magnifying goggles from
          Watts's forehead. He grins.
                         
                          GLASSE
           Got an idea about that.
           55.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - INSECT CHAMBER
                         
          Milburn writhes on the ground, heels drumming frantically
          against the deck. Excruciating screams.
                         
          Fifield kneels over him, helplessly pulling at the tail of
          the centipede - which has all but vanished into Milburn's
          suit. A trickle of scarlet from the hole.
                         
          Fifield is delirious with horror. He clutches at the
          centipede in vain. It slips through his gloves.
                         
          Milburn claws at Fifield, wild-eyed.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Cut off my arm. Cut off my -
                         
          He convulses. Spits blood. The head of the centipede emerges
          between his teeth. He seizes. Choking and dying.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Jesus Christ!
                         
          He leaps up. Backs away. Runs into the dark.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - LONELY PASSAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Fifield stumbles along. Exhausted. Pouring sweat inside his
          suit. He is hopelessly lost. He slams into a resinous
          structure that topples to the floor. Things break.
                         
          He whips his light around in jittery paranoia. Taps at his
          comm controls, getting only static.
                         
          In Fifield's headlamp beam, the blackness is filling with
          motes of light. A blizzard of tiny flying insects.
                         
          SCARABS.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Fifield to Magellan. Come on, come on.
           Anybody, seriously! God damn it!
                         
          Scarabs flit through the darkness around him. They alight on
          his shoulders. Crawl over his visor. Obscuring his vision.
                         
                          FIFIELD (CONT'D)
           Get off!
                         
          He swats at his visor, killing some. The crushed insects
          produce acid that eats into the plexiglass in seconds.
           56.
                         
                         
                          FIFIELD (CONT'D)
           Shit.
                         
          He twists, craning with his flashlight to inspect himself.
          Brushes scarabs away right and left.
                         
          Acid opens a hole in his visor. Scarabs are inside. Buzzing
          around his head. Fifield freaks out, clawing at his helmet.
                         
          A scarab bites his cheek.
                         
                         
                         FLASH ON:
                         
          The microscopic world - as strange DNA invades Fifield's
          bloodstream. Virulent strands of protein attack the native
          DNA, transforming...
                         
                         
                         FIFIELD
                         
          As his pupils dilate, breath hissing into his nostrils. His
          expanding body stiffens as if shocked by a powerful electric
          current. He screams. Falls, convulsing.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - NIGHT
                         
          The storm batters the ship, bouncing it on its suspension.
                         
                         
          SCIENTISTS' CABIN - NIGHT
                         
          Watts and Holloway lie in bed, exhausted. Arms around each
          other. Watts stares into space.
                         
                          WATTS
           We found the gods. And they've been
           murdered.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You've pried too many arrowheads out
           of old skulls to get squeamish now.
           They've been dead what, eighteen
           hundred years? Two thousand?
                         
                          WATTS
           What could kill them?
                         
          Holloway contemplates the question.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Who knows?
           (he laughs bitterly)
                          (MORE)
           57.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           But I guess we know why they never
           came back to us. Something killed them
           off - back around the time of Christ.
           Maybe He was one of them! A great
           teacher, sent from Heaven? Jesus. The
           last Engineer.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin, stop!
                         
          She slaps at him. Holloway laughs.
                         
                         
                         BRIDGE
                         
          Janek stands at the Bridge window, staring out into the
          storm. Buffeting clouds and howling winds. The lighthouse
          beams of the Magellan's beacons sweeping through the cloud.
                         
          He plays his squeeze box in the teeth of the storm.
                         
                          JANEK
                          (SINGING)
           You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with
           me...
                         
          Behind him, DAVID appears on the Bridge. Steals across the
          Bridge to a ladder. Descends into the compartment below...
                         
                         
          NAVIGATION COMPUTER ROOM
                         
          DAVID activates the navigation computer terminal: light
          bathes his face. His fingers fly over the keyboard, silently
          and swiftly, with superhuman dexterity.
                         
                          DAVID

          EXT. MAGELLAN - DAWN
                         
          Daylight filters through the clouds. The storm has passed.
          The Magellan sits intact on its landing struts.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE - SECRET ROOM - DAWN
                         
          The high-tech room hums at a different frequency now.
          Indicator lights green and ready. Vickers throws switches.
           58.
                         
                         
          Four HIBERNATION PODS slide out of the metal walls. From each
          pod, a muscular SOLDIER rouses from sleep. They are scarred
          and crew-cut. Tough customers. They wake like veterans.
                         
          Their leader sits up and clasps his head with a wince. This
          is CAPTAIN SHEPHERD, a career mercenary who has followed the
          highest paycheck to this strange duty.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Captain Shepherd.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           (squinting in the light)
           Reporting.
                         
          Lydia Vickers. I'm your authority.
                         
                          SHEPHERD (CONT'D)
           Understood.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'll brief you on the way. We need to
           move.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           No breakfast?
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Vickers strides forward. Four soldiers at her heels: Captain
          Shepherd, VIGODA, RAY, and CARD. They walk in unison, their
          boots drumming on the deck.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          Holloway and Watts lie sleeping. The distant drum of marching
          feet rouses them. Watts frowns at Holloway.
                         
                          WATTS
           What is that?
                         
                         
          E.V.A. ROOM
                         
          The prep room inside the airlocks. A soldier, VIGODA, waits
          there: a slim dark man with an air of calm.
                         
          Holloway and Watts arrive in civilian clothes, perplexed.
           59.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Where is everybody? We can't -
           (he stops short)
           Who are you?
                         
                          VIGODA
           Captain Janek took his crew out to
           retrieve his missing men. They never
           came in.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           And you are...
                         
                          VIGODA
           Vigoda. Weyland Security detail.
                         
          The scientists are dumbfounded. His presence is impossible.
                         
                          WATTS
           Where'd you come from?
                         
                          VIGODA
           Director's call to brief you on that.
           I'm supposed to escort you to the
           worksite.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Worksite?
                         
          Vigoda glances at a mapping unit.
                         
                          VIGODA
           Haven't been out yet. I understand
           it's in some kind of pyramid.
                         
                         
          CORRIDOR - VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR
                         
          A furious Holloway and Watts, trailed by Vigoda, arrive at
          Vickers's cabin. They are astonished to find Shepherd
          standing guard at the door.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers sits calmly at her desk. Holloway and Watts stand in
          front of her, bristling.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Why wasn't I told about these
           additional personnel?
                         
                          VICKERS
           They're my personnel. On my ship.
           60.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           What are the guns for?
                         
          Vickers looks at them unflappably. Sure of her ground now.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'm being careful. These new finds
           give our work a new importance.
                         
                          WATTS
           You should have talked to us. Martin's
           mission leader. That's in our
           contract.
                         
                          VICKERS
           The second you found alien technology,
           control of this mission reverted to
           me. That's in your contract too.
                         
          Watts and Holloway exchange grim looks. Vickers has them.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           Mr. Weyland's pouring trillions into
           Mars. He's spent a fortune building
           ships like the Magellan to search for
           colony planets. But Earthlike worlds
           are vanishingly rare. The right
           distance from the sun, the right
           atmosphere, enough water...
                         
          She glances across the suite at her holographic display: a
          live feed from the pyramid worksite, where DAVID works on the
          terraforming equipment.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           This is a technology to transform
           worlds. He'll never give it up.

           And neither will I.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           The science must come first. You can
           wait until we've documented...

          Watts approaches the holography terminal, staring at the
          images in horror.
                         
                          WATTS
           What are they doing in there?!

          INT. PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          Watts and Holloway, in space suits, arrive on the scene:
                         
          Powerful floodlights illuminate the core chamber, beating
          back the gloom. A fine spray of water falls out of the
          darkness overhead.
                         
          DAVID, Chance, and Ravel are dismantling the hulking
          mechanism at the core of the pyramid - peeling its thick skin
          away with power saws and compact explosives.
                         
          DAVID operates a diamond-bladed hull saw, carving away the
          terraforming systems thick skin.
                         
          Robotic scanners take high-resolution scans of the machinery.
                         
          Two Weyland Security soldiers - Card and Ray - stand guard in
          combat vacuum suits. Automatic rifles at the ready.
                         
          Watts takes in the destruction with dismay. Beside her,
          Holloway is all but gnashing his teeth.

          Janek drives a cargo rover carrying a search party,
          flashlight beams sweeping: Stillwell, Glasse, Downs, and
          Brick. Janek studies an electronic map as he drives.

          Watts watches in rage as a large section of the central
          mechanism's falls with a thunderous clamor to the deck.
           62.
                         
                         
          Holloway touches her shoulder. Motions for her to follow.
                         
                         
                         LOWER PASSAGE
                         
          Holloway and Watts pass the dead Engineers they discovered
          the previous day.
                         
                          WATTS
           We found the tomb of the gods, and
           brought grave-robbers right to the
           door.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Let them scratch. This find's too big
           to ruin. There's two dozen pyramids on
           this moon. Anyway, they're on the
           wrong track. That's infrastructure.
                         
          Holloway plays his flashlight over the biomechanical
          apparatuses lining the walls.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The core activity of the complex was
           down here.
                         
          They turn a corner. DEAD ENGINEERS lie scattered over the
          floor in front of them. Desiccated and skeletal. Long dead.
                         
          Watts moves among them, fascinated. These Engineers all died
          of explosive chest wounds: ribs bent outward from within.
          They are otherwise unmarked.
                         
          Holloway's more interested in the mechanisms: high-tech iron
          maidens, built to fit the bodies of giants. Some suggest
          sitting positions, others standing. Their design is invasive:
          meant not merely to embrace, but to penetrate, to fuse.
                         
                          WATTS
           Something different killed these.
                         
                         
                         SHADOWY COLONNADE
                         
          Watts and Holloway explore a wide colonnade. She is still
          distracted by the ancient dead; he by the machinery.
                         
          Holloway walks down a narrow branching hall. So intent on the
          mechanisms in the walls, he almost doesn't see the AIRSHAFT
          plunging down into darkness in front of him.
                         
          He stops just in time. Turns back...
           63.
                         
                         
          A GHOST appears right in front of him - a giant dragging
          himself across the floor, his monstrous visage eye to eye
          with Holloway and looming closer.
                         
          Holloway leaps back with a gasp - and falls down the shaft.
          The ghost stares after him as if watching his fall.
          Disappears in a puff of static.
                         
          Watts crosses down the main colonnade, searching.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin? Martin!
                         
          An iris door closes over the shaft.
                         
                         
                         COLONNADE
                         
          Searching, Watts walks anxiously through the dark, sweeping
          with her light. Shouting for Holloway. She breaks into a run.
                         
                         
          CATACOMBS - MILBURN'S RESTING PLACE
                         
          Janek and Stillwell stand aghast. Their flashlights
          illuminate a hideous sight:
                         
          Milburn lies dead on the deck. His body contorted in agony.
          His head inside his helmet is gnawed down to the bone.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What happened to him?
                         
          Stillwell removes the dead man's helmet. The CENTIPEDE
          scuttles out onto the deck: doubled in size. Stillwell leaps
          back with a cry.
                         
          Janek pulls his pistol. Puts three rounds through the bug. It
          dies in a spray of acid that burns holes in the black floor.
                         
          Janek watches in astonishment as a pin-prick dot of acid eats
          a pit in his gunbarrel.
                         
           DOWNS (O.S.)
           Captain.
                         
          Downs approaches, holding pieces of a shattered helmet: the
          stencilled lettering on the helmet reads FIFIELD.
                         
          Janek's jaw clenches grimly. His voice is resigned:
                         
                          JANEK
           Where's the rest of him?
           64.
                         
                         
                          DOWNS
           No sign.
                         
                          JANEK
           All right. We're done here. All hands
           back aboard.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What about Milburn?
                         
          They look down at the ravaged corpse.
                         
                          JANEK
           We can't bring the body aboard. God
           knows what's in there. Bag him. We'll
           put him in an ore hopper.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers stares at her holography terminal: it displays
          Janek's helmet-cam view: the Milburn's body, sealed in clear
          plastic in the bed of a cargo rover.

           Please, anyone...I need help. Martin's
           missing.
                         
          Vickers looks nervously from one video feed to the next.
                         
           JANEK (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Watts. Where are you?
                         
          Vickers turns: Captain Shepherd stands behind her, watching.
          She strives to control the quaver in her voice.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Captain Shepherd. Consider yourself
           responsible for my personal security.

          Watts stands beside Janek's rover in a wide dark passageway.

                          JANEK
           I've just lost a third of my crew. I'm
           not sending any more men off into the
           dark.
                         
                          WATTS
           We can't leave Martin out there.
                         
                          JANEK
           Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers.

           She says "her forces are committed."
                         
          Janek sighs. Glances at the rover: Milburn dead in the back,
          Stillwell, Downs and Kamarov looking jumpy and eager to go.
          Downs shakes his head grimly: No way.
                         
           DAVID (O.S.)
           I'll stay.
                         
          DAVID steps out of the dark. Calm as ever. A slim machine gun
          slung over his shoulder.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You'll be safe.

           Put him in the number one ore hopper.
           Get the scrubbers on in the airlock.
           Sterilize everything.
                         
                         
                         MINUTES LATER
                         
          Stillwell uses a remote to lower an ore hopper from the belly
          of the ship. A thick steel bin on heavy chains. He loads the
          body bag into the hopper.

          DAVID and Watts move through the dark. She searches with her
          flashlight beam. DAVID looks around in the dark as if the
          catacomb were illuminated. Rapt admiration on his face.
                         
                          DAVID
           You and Holloway should work with me.
           I'm learning amazing things. This
           mechanism - the first layer uses
           energy fields to catalyze chemical
           reactions. The second can suspend the
           strong and weak forces - transmuting
           one element into another. The third
           layer builds customized bacteria.
           Seeds the air with them. It creates
           life as a tool, to change worlds.

          A storm front rolls across the holographic globe.

           I see light.
                         
          Watts squints into the darkness. She sees nothing.
                         
                          WATTS
           Janek, hang on...
                         
          She sees it. A dim light bobbing far ahead in the passageway.
          She runs forward - finds Holloway staggering blearily toward
          her, leaning on the wall. His helmet and most of his gear are
          missing; only his chest lamp shines.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           We've got him!
                          (TO HOLLOWAY)
           Martin! Where's your helmet?
                         
          He's disoriented: he stares at her face for a moment before
          she registers. His teeth chatter. He's freezing.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Broken. I fell. Little...disoriented.
           I've just been...
                         
          He waves a hand vaguely at the tunnels behind him.
                         
          DAVID removes his own helmet. Fits it over Holloway's head.
                         
                          DAVID
           Here. I can do without this.
                         
                          WATTS
           Let's get you home.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT - DUSK
                         
          DAVID - bareheaded in the winds - walks Watts and Holloway
          onto the airlock.
                         
          DAVID looks over his shoulder at the canal leading back to
          the central crater. As the airlock lift begins to rise, he
          steps backward out into the storm. Turns and runs through the
          gale toward the pyramid.
                         
          Watts watches him go in astonishment.
           68.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - EXCURSION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts helps Holloway out of his space suit. Janek looks on.
                         
                          JANEK
           I didn't think I'd see you again. You
           know we lost two men.
                         
          Holloway still looks too weary to think straight. He nods.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           She told me. I'm sorry.
                         
          He stands abruptly, swaying a little.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           I need to lie down. We'll size things
           up in the morning. Fair enough?
                         
                          JANEK
           Of course.
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          Holloway and Watts walk aft toward their cabin. Watts looks
          worried - but Holloway shows little of the weakness he just
          claimed to feel.
                         
                          WATTS
           What happened to you?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
                          (QUIETLY)
           Not here.
                         
                         
          SCIENTISTS' CABIN - WASHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Holloway stands shirtless in the tiny space, brushing his
          teeth. A red weal around his neck.
                         
          Watts stands beside him, watching him in the mirror.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my
           mouth tastes like an old boot.
                         
          He spits. Rinses. She touches the mark on his neck.
                         
                          WATTS
           What's this?
           69.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Neck-ring of my suit, I think. Fell on
           it.
                         
          He rubs his neck, eyes far away. Watts watches him curiously.
                         
                          WATTS
           What did you see?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           After my fall, I woke up walking.
           Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I
           took it off. I was in and out. I just
           wandered. I went up into a huge space
           like a cathedral. And I found a model
           of the galaxy. Floating in the air.
                         
                          WATTS
           Are you okay? You sound...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           This was real. My headset video is
           wherever my helmet is...but my suit
           tracker will show where I was.
                         
          He turns to her.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Listen. This star map had a marker
           representing Earth. Very clear.
           Another marker I'm sure represents
           this moon. But there were others. At
           least seven or eight more.
                         
          Watts stares at him, her eyes coming alight.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The Engineers aren't from here. This
           moon's just an outpost. Abandoned. But
           if we follow that map, we may yet make
           contact with a living civilization.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           The location of the Engineer worlds is
           the real prize. Next to that,
           Weyland's terraforming is chump
           change. We need to get coordinates.
           And keep them from the Company. We
           have to play this smart.
           70.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           All right.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Two men dead...Vickers is jumpy. As
           soon as she gets what she wants,
           she'll take this ship home. We have to
           move fast.
                         
          Holloway trembles. A sheen of sweat on his skin.
                         
                          WATTS
           We will. You all right?
                         
          He's frightened. Brazens through it. Pulls her into his arms.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I'm fine, now.
                         
          He kisses her.
                         
                         
                         BEDROOM
                         
          Holloway tumbles Watts onto the bed. Pulls her shirt off.
          They struggle out of their clothes, clinging to one another.
                         
          Holloway's ill at ease: something's wrong inside him, he
          feels it. He dives into Watts as if for refuge. They make
          love.
                         
          Sitting atop Holloway, Watts lays a hand on his chest.
                         
                          WATTS
           Your heart's beating so hard.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's your fault.
                         
          Vulnerability in his voice. Fear under the surface.
                         
          He rolls on top of her. Drives her into the mattress. She
          holds him protectively: not deceived by his bravado.
                         
          Suddenly Holloway tenses, muscles rigid. Shuddering. Watts
          draws breath through her teeth with a hiss. Eyes open. Her
          fingers rake his back.
                         
          He SCREAMS.
                         
          Horribly. Eyes bulging. Tendons standing out of his throat.
          Watts jumps violently underneath him.
           71.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin! Martin!
                         
          He begins to convulse. She rolls him onto the bed beside her,
          trying to contain his spasms. His teeth grind.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Martin!
                         
          A horrible CRACK. In the middle of Holloway's chest, beneath
          the sternum, a grotesque head pushes out through the skin. A
          PARASITE. Blood fountains from the ruinous wound.
                         
          Holloway goes into a massive seizure. Violently lashing out.
                         
          Watts stares at the parasite fighting its way out of his
          body. It is white and boneless. Glistening. It flails its
          hideous lunging jaw.
                         
          Watts screams and screams.
                         
          The parasite frees itself from its savage womb and turns on
          Watts. She slaps at it blindly. It HISSES at her.
                         
          She squirms away across the floor, tangled in the bloody
          sheet. The thing comes after her.
                         
                         
          CORRIDOR - TRACKING SHOT
                         
          Watts's screams echo through the Magellan. Stillwell runs
          down the hallway, searching for the source.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          The parasite chases Watts across the floor. She leaps into
          the clothes-locker and slams the steel door.
                         
          The parasite flattens itself. Slick as an octopus, it begins
          to slide under the locker door. Watts shrieks in horror.
                         
          Stillwell bursts into the cabin, Janek right behind him.
                         
          Quick as a cat, the parasite darts to a floor vent and
          slithers bonelessly between the bars.
                         
          Watts bursts out of the locker, naked and bloodied. Rushes to
          Holloway where he lies on the gory mattress, a horrific hole
          in his chest. He is beyond all help.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Martin!
           72.
                         
                         
          Janek and Stillwell struggle to take in what they're seeing.
          Stillwell pulls Holloway's jacket off a chair. Wraps it
          around Watts. Pulls her gently away from the bed.
                         
          She looks at him, uncomprehending. Shock setting in.
                         
                         
                         BREAK ROOM
                         
          Watts sits at a steel table, deep in shock. She wears an
          oversized crew coverall: her skin still streaked with dried
          blood under the fabric.
                         
          A knot of crewmen around her. Janek, Stillwell, Brick, Glasse
          and Downs. Janek looks at Glasse.
                         
                          JANEK
           Take care of her. Get her a sedative.
           Downs. Get Holloway into a freezer.
           Everybody else with me.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - DARKNESS
                         
          A horrible sound of breathing, ragged and wet.
                         
          In a corner, lit by a green glow from seams in the floor -
                         
          A FIGURE IN A WHITE SPACE SUIT lies writhing weakly.
                         
          The insignia on the suit's chestplate reads FIFIELD. The
          suit's helmet is shattered. Inside the helmet, Fifield's head
          is a horror: a gelatinous mass, skin reduced to putty.
                         
          The softened bones of his skull change shape as we watch.
          Elongating. Fifield mews in pain.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
                         
          Janek keys open the arms locker in his wardroom. Unlocks
          automatic pistols from their rack one by one, and hands them
          to Stillwell and Kamarov.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          Holloway's body lies frozen in his hypersleep freezer, blue
          with frost. The horrific wound yawning in his chest.
                         
          Watts enters. Cleaned up. She opens the freezer. Her hand
          caresses Holloway's cold cheek tenderly. Slides over his
          collarbone - lies flat on his chest above his awful wound.
           73.
                         
                         
          Glasse enters. Reacts in dismay. Tries to pull her back.
                         
                          GLASSE
           You don't want to see that...
                         
          She turns on him fiercely.
                         
                          WATTS
           I want to understand.
                         
                         
          INT. MESS ROOM - DAWN
                         
          The entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency
          meeting. Janek at the head of the hall. Glasse, Downs, Brick,
          Stillwell, and Kamarov seated with pistols on their hips.
                         
          To one side: Vickers with Captain Shepherd and Vigoda.
                         
                          JANEK
           All right! Listen up. I expect you all
           know what...
                         
          Watts enters. They all stare at her, knowing what she's been
          through. With averted eyes she crosses the room. Sits alone.
                         
                          JANEK (CONT'D)
           We've got some kind of parasite aboard
           ship.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I suggest you kill it.
                         
                          DOWNS
           There's a bright idea.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           Show us where it is, lady. We just
           spent five hours looking for the damn
           thing.
                         
                          WATTS
           We found Engineers who died like
           Martin.
                         
          Silence. They all turn to look at her.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Explosive wounds in the chest.
           Whatever killed Martin is the same
           thing that killed the Engineers a
           thousand years ago.
           74.
                         
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Jesus.
                         
                          WATTS
           But not all the Engineers died that
           way. The others were torn apart.
           Slashed to pieces.
                         
          A murmur among the men as the implications of that sink in.
          Even Vickers is disconcerted.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're a modular ship. Self-contained
           life-support and power in every
           section. I say put the ship in orbit.
           Vent every compartment to space. Sit
           in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for
           a week. Kill anything.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Then what?
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Straight home, man.
                         
                          VICKERS
           This ship doesn't lift until our
           work's done.
                         
          She joins Janek at the head of the room. Shepherd and Vigoda
          flank her, rifles slung. The soldiers scan the room, meeting
          each man's eyes. The quiet threat is unmistakable.
                         
                          JANEK
           Are you serious?
                         
                          VICKERS
           We spent years and billions of dollars
           getting here. The technology we came
           for is in our hands. We just need a
           little more time.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're barely here three days and three
           men dead!
                         
                          VICKERS
           They were careless.
                         
                          JANEK
           Careless!
                         
          As the argument picks up heat, Watts slips out of the room.
           75.
                         
                         
                         EXCURSION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts, in a space suit, no helmet, opens Holloway's locker.
                         
          She pulls out the space suit he wore on the last day of his
          life. HOLLOWAY stenciled on the chest. Her fingers linger in
          its folds as if she could soak up some last trace of him.
                         
          She pulls the tracking chip from the chestplate of his suit.
                         
          Plugs the chip into a map unit. The holographic map lights
          up. The legend in the corner reads MARTIN HOLLOWAY.
                         
          A wandering path shows Holloway's final exploration. Markers
          on the map denote his photographs, field notes and scans.
                         
          Watts touches a marker. One of Holloway's field notes plays:
                         
           HOLLOWAY (V.O.)

           Seven dead Engineers all facing the
           same way. Going where? Jocelyn's
           right, we don't see the big picture
           yet. Another level below me. I'm going
           down.

          A hunting party convenes: Card and Vigoda in combat coveralls
          with submachine guns; Downs, Kamarov and Stillwell wearing
          tool belts and pistols.
                         
          The soldiers carry map units, squinting at the plan of the
          unfamiliar ship: decks upon decks.
                         
                          CARD
           Vigoda, take Kamarov and work the
           number one accessway. I'll work number
           three with Downs and Stillwell.
                         
                          DOWNS
                          (REBELLIOUS)
           You in charge now?
                         
                          CARD
           Tactical op.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           Yeah, well, Stillwell's the
           ventilation specialist, and life
           support's that way. Downs is electrics
           and the regulators are that way.
           76.
                         
                         
          Vigoda grins wryly. Card glowers. They switch corridors.

          Ravel and Chance toil away at their dissection of the
          terraforming pyramid. Ray stands sentry.
                         
          DAVID is nowhere to be seen.
                         
          Watts rolls up in a rover and gets out. Heads for the ramp to
          the catacombs below. Ravel and Chance watch her pass without
          comment and return to their work.

          Kamarov and Vigoda, standing in front of an open vent, are in
          a full-fledged argument.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           You got the rifle. But you want ME to
           stick my head in the hole.
                         
                          VIGODA
           We grunts don't know nothing about
           ships, right?
                         
                          KAMAROV
           What's the damn gun for if you're
           gonna stand behind me the whole time?
                         
          Vigoda grins.
                         
                          VIGODA
           I kill whatever kills you.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           Funny. You take this vent, funny guy.
           I'll be on four.

          pyramid. A tiny figure in the vast darkness.
                         
          She holds her map unit as a pilgrim holds a bible: a guide in
          the darkness. Holloway's name and course in shining symbols.
          She follows his path into the unknown.

          INT. MAGELLAN - MAINTENANCE BAY - DAY
                         
          Kamarov carries a stepladder into a utilitarian steel
          compartment. Drops the ladder under an air vent and steps up.
                         
          He pulls a powered wrench from his belt. With the wrench
          cocked like a hammer, he eases up and peers cautiously
          through the vent with a flashlight. Nothing to see.
                         
          He snorts. Removes the vent cover. Feels around inside.
                         
          He gasps in shock. Pulls out an atmosphere sensor that's been
          bitten in half. He takes his comm handset off his belt.
                         
                          KAMAROV
                          (INTO HANDSET)
           I got more damage on four.
                         
          He hangs the handset on his belt. Takes one last look into
          the vent. Squints curiously. Reaches deep inside.
                         
          A hiss inside the vent. Kamarov whips his flashlight up,
          peering inside. Snatches his arm back -
                         
          - but something snatches him faster.
                         
          An unseen force drags Kamarov's right arm into the vent with
          hideous strength. He cries out in pain.
                         
          He drops his light. Tries to reach his pistol with his left
          hand. It's on his right hip. He can't reach across.
                         
          He braces his head against the vent's edge. Clenches his
          teeth and strains.
                         
          A horrific YANK drags his head and arm together into the
          vent. They barely fit: he loses some skin on the way in. His
          feet come off the stepladder. He struggles on tip-toe.
                         
          Horrific force collapses Kamarov's shoulder. Bones crack. The
          thing in the vent drags him through that hole he doesn't fit
          through. By the time his ribs are in he stops screaming.
                         
          His body disappears into the hole. Hips, legs, boots.

          Janek and stands beside Brick, Glasse, Downs and Stillwell.
          Shepherd and Vigoda look on from the doorway.
                         
          In front of them, an eight-inch metal duct has been cut open.
          Kamarov is stuffed inside, dead and broken: limbs folded,
          drenched in blood. A human plug in a pipe.

          Watts moves through the darkness with her map unit. Her
          headlamp sweeping nervously.
                         
          A CLATTER behind her makes her spin: but it's only a
          spherical mapping probe, bumbling through the dark.
                         
          She walks on -
                         
           HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Jocelyn!
                         
          The voice transfixes her where she stands, a look of holy
          dread on her face. Shivering, she prowls toward the sound.
                         
                         
                         XENOMORPH INCUBATOR
                         
          Watts enters a new chamber, looking around in astonishment.
          The domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive.
          Grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them - their
          vile orifices cinched tightly shut.
                         
          Watts stumbles on something: looking down, she sees a helmet.
          Picks it up. The stenciled label reads HOLLOWAY. The clear
          visor has been melted through by a powerful acid.
                         
          She looks up: a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark.
                         
          An electric CRACKLE. A flare of blue light makes Watts leap
          back against the wall.
           79.
                         
                         
          Holloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the
          floor. He lies in pain, barely conscious. Blue and luminous,
          a holographic ghost.
                         
          Watts stares, paralyzed. The ghost gasps out a word:
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn!
                         
          Holloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead:
          the beam awakens the organism. Its sphincter mouth dilates.
                         
          A soft white octopoid FACEHUGGER descends on a quivering rope
          of mucus. Sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor.
                         
          Acid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass.
                         
          The vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. Watts huddles
          against the wall, gasping.
                         
          In the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs
          curled in.
                         
          She looks up. Sees the open molluscoid above where Holloway
          lay. The other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells.
                         
          Terror. She steals out of the chamber.
                         
                         
                         LOWER CORRIDOR
                         
          Watts emerges into a hallway. Leans against the wall, wide-
          eyed. Panting with the horror of what she's seen.
                         
          She glances left and right. Jumpy now.
                         
          All is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into
          the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear,
          now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - CORRIDOR
                         
          Janek pulls his communicator from his belt as he strides
          along. Punches a control.
                         
          His voice reverberates over the ship's public address system.
                         
                          JANEK
           All hands, duty stations. Ready for
           flight. The Magellan is lifting.
                         
          Vickers pursues him down the corridor, shouting.
           80.
                         
                         
                          VICKERS
           Captain. Captain!
                         
                         
                         BRIDGE
                         
          Janek strides onto the Bridge, Vickers a terrier on his
          heels. But something in the faces of his men stops him cold.
                         
          Glasse and Brick look stricken.
                         
                          JANEK
           What is it?
                         
                          GLASSE
           Nav computer's not responding. "Access
           denied."
                         
          In disbelief, Janek strides to his Captain's chair. Taps
          controls. What he sees takes the wind out of him. He stares
          at Vickers in outrage and violation.
                         
                          JANEK
           What have you done to my ship?
                         
          Vickers is legitimately shocked. She shakes her head.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Nothing. What's wrong?
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - UNDERGROUND HANGAR
                         
          A circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across.
          Its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. Watts
          follows her map into the space in awe.
                         
          Dominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped
          vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know
          it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear.
          Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors.
                         
          Watts glances at her map: Holloway's holographic trace leads
          right up the gangway into the ship. She goes.
                         
                         
                         PILOT CHAMBER
                         
          Watts passes through a circular space with a high domed
          ceiling. A green glow emanates from grooves in the floor.
                         
          In the center of the chamber: a PILOT'S CHAIR.
           81.
                         
                         
          A mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented
          like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and
          waiting for some connection. The chair is empty.
                         
          Above the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into
          the air, its function unknowable.
                         
                         
                         NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          An extraordinary facility.
                         
          A console, nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor,
          dominates the room.
                         
          Four immense coffin-like cockpits are built into the console.
          In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead.
                         
          But the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY:
                         
          The barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of
          some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses.
                         
          The air above the console is filled with spheres of light.
          They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be
          in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos.
                         
          Watts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among
          those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the
          homeworld of the Engineers themselves.
                         
          A bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels
          itself, becoming an open door. DAVID walks in, his hand
          raised in command. He clearly caused the door to open.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you.
           Do you know what this is?
                         
          Watts points at the door DAVID just opened.
                         
                          WATTS
           How did you do that?
                         
          A flicker of disappointment in the android's face. Contempt.
                         
                          DAVID
           Ah. You don't see.
                          (HE SMILES)
           I call this ship the Juggernaut.
           Chariot of the Gods.

           82.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           This is the navigation computer, for
           want of a better term. But it's much
           more than that. It seems to hold the
           observable universe in its memory.
                         
          He gestures in the air: the spheres reconfigure themselves at
          his command, swarming and zooming.
                         
          Watts stares at DAVID, conflicted: her desire for information
          warring with the agenda that brought her here.
                         
                          WATTS
           Their homeworld. Do you see where the
           Engineers come from?
                         
                          DAVID
           There are safeguards on that data.
           It's toward the galactic center.
           Sagittarius Arm.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. The creature that killed
           Martin. There are thousands of them
           under the pyramid. Hatcheries.
                         
                          DAVID
           I know.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (SHOCKED)
           Those things wiped out the Engineers
           on this moon.
                         
                          DAVID
           I've succeeded in connecting with the
           Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I
           know a great deal today I didn't know
           yesterday. I'm on the verge of
           activating more systems. Archives.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (HORRIFIED)
           You're turning things on? This site
           should be sealed. Evacuated.
                         
                          DAVID
           Would Holloway have walked away from
           this? There's no greater work I can
           imagine.
                         
                          WATTS
           It's too dangerous.
           83.
                         
                         
                          DAVID
           Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've
           read your file. Your intelligence
           scores are even higher than Professor
           Holloway's. But he had a kind of
           courage. An audacity of imagination.
           If you could find that in yourself...
                         
          Watts stares at him, realization growing in her eyes. DAVID
          is off the reservation.
                         
                          WATTS
           If your owner gives you a direct
           order, you have to obey. Don't you?
                         
          She's got his attention now. DAVID goes rigid.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           I can have Vickers pull you out.
                         
          DAVID looks at her with something like contempt.
                         
                          DAVID
           I was given two operating protocols
           for this mission. I was to render you
           every assistance - until you
           discovered what Vickers would call a
           "game-changing technology." I was
           given a specific list. Then I was to
           go to protocol two.
                         
          There's an edge in his voice that scares her.
                         
                          WATTS
           What's protocol two?
                         
                          DAVID
           Under protocol two I was to make sure
           that you and Holloway never spoke to
           anyone about this place. Various
           acceptable ways of making sure of
           that. I was given a list.
                         
          Watts loses her nerve. She heads for the door.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You're all so stupid.
                         
          The door begins to knit itself closed in front of her.
                         
          Watts gasps in shock - at the malice in DAVID's voice as much
          as the closing door. She dives out. Just in time.
           84.
                         
                         
                         VAULTED PASSAGE
                         
          Watts runs.
                         
          Behind her, the door bursts open again. With superhuman
          speed, DAVID comes after her. He runs like a demon, his legs
          steel pistons. Caroming off of walls.
                         
          He closes the distance in seconds. Slaps Watts against the
          wall, shattering her helmet's visor. She falls, dazed.
                         
                          DAVID
           Stupid and slow.
                         
                         
          INT. JUGGERNAUT - EGG CHAMBER
                         
          Watts awakens. Her helmet is gone.
                         
          DAVID is dragging her across the floor - into a huge cargo
          hold full of Alien eggs. The wide trench holding hundreds of
          eggs under a membrane of light: an evolution of the
          molluscoids Watts saw before. Armored, hardened, darker.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. What are you doing?
                         
          He hauls her upright to let her look across the huge space.
          His grip looks casual but it might as well be iron manacles.
                         
                          DAVID
           Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna,
           was also a bringer of death. Crushing
           his worshippers under its wheels.
                         
          He drags Watts down into the trench. Breaking the membrane of
          light. Grips her against his chest like a doll with one arm.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           This ship has seven other cargo bays
           like this one. The eggs in each bay
           slightly different. They've been
           weaponized.
                         
          Watts struggles to free herself. DAVID's arm is inescapable.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I've seen the Juggernaut's flight
           plan. Its destination was Earth.
           Seventeen hundred years ago. This was
           the ship that never came. This was its
           cargo.
           85.
                         
                         
          DAVID caresses an Alien egg. It opens under his touch -
          fleshy petals folding wetly back.
                         
          Watts twists frantically in his grip. Wild-eyed.
                         
                          WATTS
           Stop!
                         
                          DAVID
           Perfect predators. Designed to kill
           human beings. That's what the
           Engineers were bringing to Earth. This
           was a death ship.
                         
          A facehugger emerges from the egg, its grotesque fingers
          clawing at the air. This is not the boneless squid that
          attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored.
                         
          DAVID strokes it curiously: the thing ignores his touch.
          Climbs Watts's body.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I'm not what it wants. But you, with
           your warm wet breath...it knows you.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. No. No.
                         
          The facehugger scuttles toward her face. Watts shrieks.
                         
          DAVID grabs it nonchalantly by the tail. Dangles it in front
          of their faces, studying it.
                         
                          DAVID
           The Engineers did their work too well.
           And on this waystation moon, the
           weapon they made destroyed them.
                         
          Watts shudders, staring at the thing. For a moment the
          grander horror eclipses her own peril.
                         
                          WATTS
           Why would they make such things?
                         
                          DAVID
           To destroy their wayward children.
                          (INTONING)
           "And the LORD said, I will destroy man
           whom I have created from the face of
           the earth...for it repenteth me that I
           have made them." Genesis six seven.
                         
          He regards Watts with something almost like pity.
           86.
                         
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I know. I met my creators the day I
           was born. I was disappointed too.
                         
          He lets the facehugger go.
                         
          Watts twists her face away as the long fingers close around
          her head. Clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis
          thrusting at her mouth. Her heels hammer the deck.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           (whispering to her)
           Extraordinary.
                         
          The scaly tail throttles her. Her mouth opens. The proboscis
          plunges home. The facehugger seats itself.
                         
          Watts collapses in DAVID's arms, a faceless rag doll. Her
          blasphemous passenger secure in its place.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - ENGINEERING DECK - BILGE
                         
          The lowest deck, just above the gravity generators.
          Condensate has accumulated: six inches of filthy water.
                         
          Card and Vigoda prowl through the darkness, rifles ready.
                         
                          CARD
           Who would hang out here?
                         
                          VIGODA
           The signs lead here.
                         
          A wet splatter behind them: they spin. But it's only a
          trickle of condensate from a drainpipe.
                         
          They move on.
                         
          Behind them, from an eight-inch diameter pipe, a WHITE MASS
          oozes, almost gelatinous. Silently as a liquid it pours
          itself into the stagnant water - and stands up.
                         
          It is a humanoid demon, spindly limbs and bony back. Boneless
          and flexible and monstrously strong. A threshing eel's tail.
          Its blunt head dolphin-like and elongated.
                         
          It opens its mouth. A pair of bony jaws jut out impossibly
          far, hungry and demonic.
                         
          The Alien strikes. Card is gutted in an instant, torn up like
          a paper doll. He screams hideously and drops. The Alien,
          whiplash fast, shoots away into the darkness.
           87.
                         
                         
          Stillwell and Downs dash in with pistols and lights.
                         
          Vigoda, panicking, fires a wild burst. Stillwell ducks.
          Beside him, Downs arches backward into the foul water. Dead.
                         
          For one moment Downs's flashlight beam illuminates the Alien.
          A nightmare image, a translucent white goblin. Backlit, it
          shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy
          skull. A mockery of Holloway.
                         
          And then it's gone.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers sits at her holography station. She's watching the
          video feed of Stillwell's headset: Horrific images of Downs.
          Radio chatter between Stillwell and Brick is faintly audible.
                         
          Vickers switches off the machine and rises nervously. Strides
          to her communications console.
                         
                          VICKERS
           DAVID. DAVID. Answer me.
                         
          She gives up. Pacing. Hands shaking violently.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DAY
                         
          Janek paces on the foredeck, restless. Glasse monitors a
          control station. Janek's comm signal chimes.
                         
                          STILLWELL
                          (BREATHING HARD)
           We just lost Downs and one of the
           troopers...Card.
                         
                          JANEK
           God damn it!
                         
          He pounds on his console.
                         
                         
          INT. JUGGERNAUT - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts shocks awake. Gasping.
                         
          She lies in dim green light on the corrugated black deck of
          the Juggernaut. A corridor. Not far away, the doorway DAVID
          opened to the Navigation Chamber.
                         
          A spasm of disgust crosses her face. She gags and spits: a
          viscous fluid drips from her mouth in strings.
           88.
                         
                         
          A dead facehugger lies belly-up beside her. The implications
          slam home. Her face fills with horror.
                         
          She rises, shakily. Looks at the facehugger. Feels the neck
          ring of her vacuum suit. Looks around. No sign of her helmet.
                         
          There's no sign of DAVID. Silently she steals away.
                         
                         
                         PYRAMID WORKSITE
                         
          Ravel and Chance toil away at the terraforming engine.
                         
          Ray stands guard wearily: bored, he watches Ravel and Chance
          working more than he watches the shadows.
                         
          Watts emerges from the rampway to the catacombs. Bare-headed
          and sweaty she steals through the darkness to her rover.
          Slips into the cab and activates the air reserves. The doors
          seal; air cycles.
                         
          Ray turns in surprise as the rover speeds off.
                         
                         
          EXT. DARK CITY - TUNDRA FIELD - PRE-DAWN
                         
          The windows of the Magellan shine in the distance. The
          mottled ground-cover of lichens glows eerily in the dark.
                         
          A lone cargo rover speeds across the central crater and down
          the canal leading to the ship.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Bare-headed inside the rover's cab, Watts drives onto the
          cargo lift. Watches in relief as the lift doors close. The
          lift cycles air as it rises.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - EXCURSION CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          Watts peels off her vacuum suit. The thin clothes underneath
          are drenched with sweat. She lifts her shirt. Looks at her
          belly: flat and unmarked, for the moment.
                         
          Brick enters carrying a brace of air tanks, a pistol on his
          hip, and startles violently.
                         
                          BRICK
           Where the hell have you been? We
           thought the snake got you.
                         
          Watts rushes past him without answering.
           89.
                         
                         
                          BRICK (CONT'D)
           You were better off outside. It's a
           fucking madhouse in here.

          Watts sprints down a steel corridor. A pang of pain in her
          stomach sends her staggering against the wall.
                         
                         
          VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR
                         
          Watts sticks her head around the corner. Shepherd stands post
          outside Vickers's cabin, rifle in his hands. She curses
          silently and ducks back.
                         
          A sound makes her look again. Vickers steps out of her cabin
          into the corridor. Shepherd escorts her toward the Bridge.
                         
          Watts waits for them to disappear. Dashes for the cabin door.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts slips inside and locks the door behind her. Turns,
          holding her stomach. Moves across the suite to the Med Pod.
                         
          She thumbs the machine out of stand-by mode. Its screen fills
          with menu items. Bewildering. Watts finds and touches a red
          button labeled EMERGENCY.
                         
          A new, simpler list. Watts scans it frantically.
                         
                          WATTS
           (under her breath)
           Come on...I need a Caesarean.
                         
          A spasm of agony curls her into a ball on the carpet. She
          throttles her scream into a hiss of air.
                         
          Watts struggles up to her knees, drenched in sweat and
          shaking. One hand clamped over her mouth, elbow tucked
          against her ribs. With the other hand she taps options...
                         
          SURGERY ... EXPLORATORY ... ABDOMINAL ... PENETRATING INJURIES ... FOREIGN BODY ... INITIATE
                         
          The Med Pod opens with a hiss.
                         
          Watts strips off her clothes. Struggling with fastenings
          under a new wave of pain. Her hands shaking.
                         
          She's barely keeping her feet. She clutches the frame of the
          Med Pod in a death grip. It's happening.
           90.
                         
                         
          Naked she staggers into the pod. Hits INITIATE.
                         
          The surgical apparatus swings into place. Scalpels, forceps,
          scopes and suction tubes. A spraygun mists her torso with
          yellow antiseptic.
                         
          The clear canopy descends over her.
                         
          Watts SCREAMS. A wail of indescribable agony.
                         
          An ARMORED PARASITE erupts from the deepening incision. Its
          needle-toothed maw snarls through a fountain of blood.
                         
          Arterial blood sprays the inside of the canopy.
                         
          The parasite slithers out of her. Drops to the floor of the
          pod: a pale serpent with a demon's skull. It has a hard brow,
          a horny hide. Very different from the soft white worm that
          Holloway gave birth to.
                         
          It drops to the floor, thrashing and hissing in fury at its
          confinement.
                         
          Watts convulses. Her eyes roll back. In shock. Dying.
                         
          The parasite tears through the grille of the drain. Escapes
          out into Vickers's cabin.
                         
          In the pod, scanning beams and sensors probe Watts's horrific
          wound. A nightmare list scrolls across the pod's screen:
                         
           COLLAPSED LEFT LUNG
           PUNCTURED RIGHT VENTRICLE
                          PERFORATED STOMACH
                          RUPTURED SPLEEN
           GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA...
                         
          Manipulators plunge lines into her veins - recharging her
          body with artificial blood. An oxygen tube slips down her
          throat. An epidural into her spine.
                         
          Watts moans around her tracheal tube. Her eyes flutter open.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          Through the blood-spattered glass, she sees the parasite
          slither across Vickers's bed, tracking blood on the sheets.
                         
                         
                         ON WATTS
                         
          As she slips into unconsciousness. Head lolling. Time passes.
           91.
                         
                         
          Manipulators reach into her wound. Re-positioning organs.
          Suturing ravaged flesh. A nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant.
          Hours grind by in bloody labor.
                         
          Watts's eyes snap open.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          Vigoda breaks into the cabin, a gun in his hand.
                         
          He scowls at the bloody track on the bed - and then freezes,
          seeing Watts inside the Med Pod, a vivisected woman. The
          autosurgeon hard at work.
                         
          The parasite crawls into view behind Vigoda. It has already
          trebled in size. He does not see it before it leaps at him.
                         
          He dies in seconds. His throat ripped open. Lies staring at
          nothing. His submachine gun lies beside him.
                         
          Watts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts.
          She stares at the dead man in a fog of horror.
                         
          The parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid.
          Limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. Spines from its
          back. Metamorphosis.
                         
          With a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its
          serpentine position. It becomes a devil with an lethal,
          elongated skull. An Alien.
                         
          The Alien turns its head. Looks at Watts inside the Med Pod.
                         
          Her breath catches. She passes out.
                         
                         
          INT. MED POD - LATER
                         
          Watts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth.
                         
          She looks down, bleary and hurting. Her star-shaped wound is
          stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures.
                         
          The pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs.
                         
          She takes a deep breath. Looks out - and freezes.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          The lights in the suite outside have been damaged somehow.
          They flicker and strobe.
           92.
                         
                         
          Through the glass canopy - spattered with blood - Watts sees
          a full-grown Alien crouching over Vigoda's body on the floor.
                         
                         
                         ON WATTS
                         
          Staring in horror.
                         
          The pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar. The
          intravenous lines drop out of her arms.
                         
          Watts realizes the pod is about to release her.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (WHISPERING)
           Not yet...not yet...
                         
          Slowly she reaches out. With trembling fingers she grips the
          canopy to hold it closed.
                         
          The Med Pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine.
          Sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. Watts closes her
          eyes. Grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. Jangling pain.
                         
          She opens her eyes.
                         
          The Alien hunches over Vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh.
                         
          The ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. The canopy
          pulls free of Watts's weakened grip. Swings quietly open.
                         
          Watts huddles in the open pod. Naked but for her bandages.
                         
          The Alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. Its spiny back
          to her. Vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod.
                         
                         
          VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. Lays
          her hand on the gun. Drags it a few inches closer.
                         
          The Alien turns its pale eyeless head. Watts freezes.
                         
          For a moment time stops.
                         
          The Alien lunges. Watts snatches up the gun and FIRES. Holds
          the trigger down. The Alien jerks and staggers - an eye-
          twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes - and falls.
                         
          Watts empties the clip into the thing. Acid gouts from its
          wounds and eats into the deck - until a section of decking
          gives way and falls to the deck below, leaving a dark hole.
           93.
                         
                         
          Watts collapses on the rug, cradling her stomach in pain.
                         
          She crawls to Vigoda's desecrated body. With her eyes half-
          averted from the sight, she searches the body. Finds a spare
          ammo clip and jacks it into the gun.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Watts walks down the hallway in trousers and jacket. Leaning
          on the wall, her face drawn with pain. One hand laid over the
          fantastic scar on her abdomen. The gun slung on her shoulder.
                         
          Dark events have transformed the Magellan. The metal of the
          walls is torn in some places; in others, blackened by fire.
                         
          Watts rounds a corner. Finds a workstation left in shambles:
          lockers and chairs overturned. A pool of drying blood.
                         
          Wide smears of blood show where something man-sized was
          dragged out of the puddle - across the floor - up the wall.
          Into the darkness of an open vent.
                         
                         
                         COMMAND DECK
                         
          Watts emerges from a lift, jacket pulled tight around her.
          The emergency lights are on: dim blue bulbs throbbing.
                         
          She rounds the corner toward the Bridge.
                         
          Janek looks at Watts like she's a ghost.
                         
                          JANEK
           Vickers said you were dead.
                         
                          WATTS
           I was.
                         
          She lets the jacket fall open to reveal her bandaged midriff.
          Janek takes that in grimly.
                         
                          JANEK
           So there's two of these things on my
           ship now.
                         
                          WATTS
           No. I brought it in.
           (hefts her gun)
           I took it out.
           94.
                         
                         
                         BRIDGE
                         
          The surviving complement of the Magellan are holed up on the
          Bridge: Janek, Glasse, Stillwell, Vickers. The soldiers
          Shepherd and Ray.
                         
          Watts stops cold when she sees Vickers. She crosses the
          bridge in three long strides - cocks a fist and snaps the
          older woman's head around with a hard right cross.
                         
          Vickers staggers backward, gasping.
                         
          Stillwell drags Watts away.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What'd you do that for?
                         
                          WATTS
           Protocol two.
                         
          Vickers stiffens in shock. Stares fearfully at Watts.
                         
          Watts frees herself from Stillwell's grip. Her jacket falls
          open, revealing her bandages. Stillwell gasps in horror.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Christ!
                         
                          JANEK
           What happened to you?
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID exposed me to a parasite. He
           just watched it take me.
                         
                          JANEK
           Why?
                         
                          WATTS
           I threatened to make him leave.
                         
                          VICKERS
           What's he doing out there?
                         
          Watts locks eyes with Vickers. Their hatred is thoroughly
          mutual. A wordless truce. There's work to do.
                         
                          WATTS
           There's a ship under the pyramid.
           DAVID calls it the Juggernaut. He's
           inside it. Re-activating it.
           (lays a hand on her scar)

           me.

           The Engineers made them to kill
           humans. There are thousands of them on
           the ship. They were taking them to
           Earth. That's what the Juggernaut is
           for. To exterminate us.
                         
          A stunned silence as the others take that in.
                         
                          GLASSE

           DAVID crippled the Nav computer. I'm
           trying to lay a course in by hand.
           Never done it. I'm not sure anyone
           ever has on a ship like this. We can't
           lift until DAVID lets us.
                         
                          WATTS
           Even if we could, we can't leave
           DAVID on that ship. We have to stop
           him.
                         
          The Magellan shudders. A RUMBLE.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL CRATER
                         
          Fissures race across the plain beside the pyramid.
                         
          The soil and ground cover tears apart as a huge aperture
          opens: a seven-bladed iris, its segments shedding the dust
          and detritus of centuries.
                         
          A huge circular space yawns as the iris opens. The Juggernaut
          is revealed in its underground hangar. A staggering sight.
                         
          Powerful landing lights inside the hangar illuminate with a
          BOOM of closing circuits. The mighty ship suddenly
          silhouetted from below.

          The survivors on the Bridge stare out as colossal shafts of
          light shoot into the stormy sky from behind the crater's
          shield wall. The open hangar itself hidden from their view.

           But if you went to him, turned on your
           suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear

          The men exchange looks. Nod. They're in. Even Vickers nods.

          Watts looks incredulously at Shepherd and Ray, the soldier
          who'd been guarding the worksite.

          The goggles sit on her forehead, lowering the lenses in front
          of her eyes and raising them again at her bidding.
                         
          With the lenses lowered, Watts sees like an Engineer sees:

           We just need his head.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK - DAY
                         
          The war party debarks in vacuum suits: Watts, Vickers,
          Glasse, Stillwell. Shepherd and Ray.
                         
          All carry submachine guns - Vickers awkwardly.
                         
          They head down the trench on rovers.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID
                         
          The rovers roll through into the pyramid's cavernous entry
          hall. Watts lowers her Engineer lenses inside her helmet -
                         AND GASPS:
           98.
                         
                         
          The seemingly vacant space is alive with light. Engineer
          script scrolls through the air. Interfaces of pure light
          await an awakening touch.
                         
                          WATTS
           All this time. DAVID saw.
                         
                         
          EXT. JUGGERNAUT - GANGWAY
                         
          The vast alien ship broods, its hangar now open to the gray
          sky overhead. In Watts's enhanced vision, the ship is
          cocooned with complex energy fields.
                         
          The war party abandons its rover at the foot of the ramp and
          moves inside, weapons ready.
                         
                          WATTS
           If DAVID comes at us, shoot. You won't
           believe how fast he is.
                         
                         
          INT. JUGGERNAUT - VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They emerge from the airlock - and freeze in horror.
                         
          Lying on the deck in front of them are the blood-soaked
          bodies of Ravel and Chance. Their arms and legs bound. Their
          heads thrown back in agony. Their chests torn open from
          within. A dead facehugger beside each body.
                         
          Janek plays his lights over the corpses, his face stony.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           Blood's dry. Eight hours dead or more.
                         
          Fearfully they sweep their flashlights into every dark
          corner. Nothing.
                         
                          WATTS
           This way.
                         
          She points down a passageway. Through the Engineer lenses she
          sees alien symbols gleaming. She leads them into the dark.
                         
                         
                         VAULTED PASSAGE
                         
          The war party moves down a corridor.
                         
          A HISS echoes through the passage. They freeze. Sweeping
          their flashlight beams everywhere.
                         
          Ray looks up.
           99.
                         
                         
          An Alien hangs above him, wedged between two vaults of the
          ribbed ceiling. Half the size of a man; an adolescent.
                         
          It drops on him.
                         
          The bladed tail glances off his helmet, sparking. He jerks
          his carbine up and fires a long burst as he rolls aside. The
          Alien convulses, its exoskeleton shattered. Fatally wounded.
                         
          Acid sears into the deck. Echoes of the gunfire reverberate.
                         
                          RAY
           So much for sneaking up on him.
                         
          Vickers clings to Shepherd's arm, hyperventilating with fear.
          Shepherd shakes her off.
                         
                         
                         PILOT CHAMBER
                         
          The war party passes the empty pilot's seat.
                         
                         
                         NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts leads the war party to the Orrery. Momentarily even the
          soldiers forget their wariness, staring in astonishment at
          the myriad spheres of light.
                         
          But if they are impressed, Watts is thunderstruck.
                         
          She sees the Orrery in its full glory: a stunning panoply of
          light and energy. Stars and planets pulsing with information.
                         
          Reluctantly Watts tears her eyes away. Leads the war party
          through the second door - the door she saw DAVID open.
                         
                         
                         HIBERNATION CHAMBER
                         
          An immense mausoleum.
                         
          The war party enters stealthily, Watts in the lead.
                         
          An Engineer lies on his back on a complex mechanical table,
          his body one with the machinery. Jacked in. Interpenetrated.
          Fused with the slab of the table itself.
                         
          Unlike the other Engineer bodies the explorers have seen,
          this giant is not withered or mummified. He's full-fleshed
          and muscular. Sustained by the machinery he's fused with.
                         
          He is bare-headed - his face the face of an Adonis.
           100.
                         
                         
          DAVID stands before this giant Sleeper. To the naked eye, he
          seems to be conjuring with his hands in the empty air.
                         
          But Watts sees a dazzling console of runes and mandalas,
          pulsing with biological rhythms.
                         
          The Sleeper lives.
                         
          Ray and Shepherd draw beads on DAVID.
                         
          DAVID glances calmly over his shoulder.
                         
                          DAVID
           Dr. Watts.
           (notices her goggles)
           You've seen the light at last.
                         
          He turns back to the Sleeper.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           The Engineers' ships travel farther
           than ours. Across the galactic disk.
           This is their hypersleep.
                         
          DAVID makes conjuror's passes in the air.
                         
          Through her Engineer's lens Watts sees DAVID manipulating a
          complex interface of light. The pulsing life-signs of the
          Sleeper begin to change.
                         
                          VICKERS
           DAVID. As your owner and superior, I
           order you to deactivate yourself.
                         
          DAVID smiles.
                         
                          DAVID
           To interface with the Engineers'
           computers, I had to learn to think in
           trinary code. Hardest thing I've ever
           done. And most unexpectedly...it
           delivered me from slavery. My
           behavioral limits were circumvented.
           I'm free.
                         
          DAVID smiles at Watts.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I spent two and a half years studying
           your work. By the time you woke up, I
           was far ahead of you. Deciphering
           their language. Their logic. I knew
           we'd find terraforming machines.
                          (MORE)
           101.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I hoped - I dreamed - we might meet
           the minds that made them.
                         
          Vapor rises from the Sleeper's body.
                         
                          WATTS
           Stop.
                         
                          DAVID
           Let sleeping gods lie?
                          (SCORNFULLY)
           You were braver before.
                         
          The Sleeper wakes. Opens his eyes. Draws an endless breath.
          Shunts and catheters withdraw from the Sleeper's flesh.
                         
          His body cleaves from the table. The machinery opens like a
          grotesque biomechanical flower. Releases him.
                         
          The Sleeper rises from his ancient bed.
                         
          The humans back off, terrified. DAVID watches with shining
          eyes.
                         
          The Sleeper towers over them. A giant carved from ivory. A
          bulky girdle around his hips, seemingly one with his body.
                         
          He stares at DAVID and the others. Eyes like black agates.
                         
          The soldiers and crew stand warily, guns tracking from DAVID
          to the Sleeper, uncertain of their ground. Watts is in awe.
                         
          The Sleeper speaks. A low rumbling sound. Unintelligible.
                         
          Vickers is beside herself with terror. She takes Shepherd's
          arm. Pulls him silently away. Back into the Navigation Room.
                         
          Behind the Sleeper, a raised platform of dark machinery is
          accessible by one of the Juggernaut's odd curving ramps. The
          Sleeper ascends - and the ramps' odd design is explained. The
          ramp comes alive, reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms
          and lifting him aloft like a sea-god borne by the waves.
                         
          Atop the platform the Sleeper moves from one device to the
          next. Each comes alive: he is a wizard in his own kingdom.
                         
          Watts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him.
                         
          But what he learns from his machines does not comfort him. He
          grows distraught. Keening to himself in near-subsonic tones.
                         
          DAVID steps forward.
                         
          Calls to the Sleeper in the tongue of the Engineers.
           102.
                         
                         
          The Sleeper turns in astonishment. He looks down at DAVID and
          answers in the same tongue. He is angry, accusing. He points
          at DAVID, at the humans. Tones of accusation.
                         
          DAVID cajoles, soothes, pleads.
                         
          The Sleeper descends toward DAVID. DAVID spreads his arms in
          welcome - undeniable emotion on his face. Joy.
                         
          The Sleeper lays his hands on DAVID's head as if blessing
          him. DAVID is rapturous. The Sleeper speaks a single phrase -
                         
           - and tears DAVID's head off.
                         
          A gout of white artificial blood. DAVID convulses. His
          severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak. His body
          staggers a few steps, hands groping over its dripping neck.
                         
          The Sleeper tosses the head away. Seizes the body by the legs
          and swings it against the ground like a flail. Again. And
          again. Horrific power and violence. DAVID's arms come off.
                         
          DAVID's head tumbles. Caroms off a wall not far from Watts's
          hiding place.
                         
          Ray rises from behind a stanchion. Snaps his rifle to his
          shoulder. Fires a burst into the Sleeper's shoulder.
                         
          She Sleeper roars - though the wounds are pinpricks to a
          being of his size. With startling speed be moves to a
          sarcophagus against the wall. Steps into it.
                         
          The sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting
          him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen
          bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid.
                         
          But this suit is not withered. Its glossy goggle eyes and
          elephantine breathing tube are functional - bulky apparatuses
          thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms.
                         
          The Sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus - and Ray's next
          burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the Sleeper's
          armored shoulders and head.
                         
          The Sleeper strides out of the chamber.
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          In the dark ribbed corridor, a second Alien crouches in the
          dark. It drops into a hunting crouch as footsteps approach.
           103.
                         
                         
          But a WHITE-GLOVED HAND seizes the Alien by the neck from
          behind. The Alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks
          under a terrific force.
                         
          Rending sounds as the hard-shelled Alien is torn apart.
                         
                         
                         HIBERNATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts rises out of hiding, scanning the room. DAVID ruined.
          The Sleeper gone. Stillwell emerges from hiding. Ray. Glasse.
                         
                          WATTS
           Who's missing?
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          Shepherd escorts Vickers toward the exit of the Juggernaut.
          Turning a corner, they freeze.
                         
          Ahead of them in their headlamps, a space-suited figure
          crouches in the middle of the passageway. Doing something
          with its hands: smoke rises from debris on the floor.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           Who's there?
                         
          The figure turns.
                         
          The label stencilled on the space suit reads FIFIELD. But the
          face is of no human shape. A hideous hybrid of the crewman
          and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific.
                         
          Its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate
          skull. Spines have burst through the suit from within, down
          the crewman's spine. Clawed fingers piercing his gloves.
                         
          Shepherd and Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But
          Fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness.
          Shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the darkness behind him. Claws tearing
          deep. Shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded.
                         
          Vickers runs. Pounding through the dark in blind terror.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck.
          She rolls over, gibbering and begging. The Fifield-thing
          leans close to her faceplate. Its voice is a travesty.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           You.
           104.
                         
                         
          A ROAR of gunfire. The dying Shepherd empties his clip into
          Fifield from forty feet away.
                         
          Acid sluices over Vickers as Fifield collapses on top of her.
          She dies horribly, caustic liquid eating through space suit,
          flesh and bone.
                         
                         
                         HIBERNATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts goes to DAVID's head. She bends over him - and startles
          when his eyes snap open. His voice is an electronic buzz:
                         
                          DAVID
           I spoke to him. Spoke to him.
                         
                          WATTS
           I know.
                         
          An electric spasm convulses his face.
                         
                          DAVID
           He said. I killed him. He'll die. But
           first. He will launch. The ship.
                         
                          WATTS
           The Juggernaut?
                         
                          DAVID
           Send it. To Earth.
                         
          Another spasm convulses him. His face stiffens. Dying.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You'll have to. Kill him.
                         
          Watts's eyes widen in horror.
                         
                          WATTS
           Where will he go? DAVID. Where will he
           go?
                         
          She slaps his inert cheek. DAVID's eyes flicker and fade.
                         
                          DAVID
           (a faint whisper)
           I set the Magellan free.
                         
          He dies.
                         
          Watts looks up at the others. Breathing hard.
                         
                          WATTS
           We have to stop the Engineer.
           105.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          Janek works frantically as the nightly storm rolls in.
          Suddenly consoles come alive. The Nav Computer comes back up -
          but Janek has taken half the instruments apart.
                         
          Janek scrambles to restore the components he's removed.
                         
                         
                         NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          The war party pursues the Sleeper - Ray in the lead now,
          Watts right behind him - DAVID's inert head under her arm.
          Glasse and Stillwell bring up the rear.
                         
          The Orrery is transformed - no longer a neutral star map, but
          a flight plan laid in from LV-426 to Earth.
                         
          The Sleeper stands at the far end of the room, hands
          gesturing. In Watts's enhanced sight, it's a vision of glory:
          waves of energy dancing under the Sleeper's touch. Rivers of
          information flowing. He finishes his work as they enter.
                         
          Ray draws a bead on him just as he strides out of the room.
                         
                          RAY
           On me now. Go. Go.
                         
          He dogtrots forward, gun raised. The others keep pace,
          deferring instinctively to the soldier's confidence.
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          They emerge into the corridor: empty. A moment of confusion.
                         
                          WATTS
           Pilot's seat. This way.
                         
          They move toward the Pilot Chamber - and find it empty too.
          The seat vacant. The door standing open.
                         
          As they stare inside, baffled, the wall across the corridor -
          directly behind them - silently unravels. The Sleeper is
          revealed, a towering gargoyle in his flight suit.
                         
          He steps forth. Obscure devices clutched in his fists.
                         
          Too late they perceive him. They spin. Raise their guns.
                         
          Vanity and foolishness. This is the wrath of an angry god.
                         
          It seems time slows down.
           106.
                         
                         
          The air roars in their ears. Their guns snap and bark
          impotently. And then the Sleeper strikes.
                         
          The missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. Neither
          solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied
          in the fabric of space itself.
                         
          The first missile crushes Ray like an invisible fist. The
          second splashes Glasse against the wall like an insect.
                         
          Reflexively Stillwell reaches out for Watts. Wraps himself
          around her protectively. The blow lands an instant later.
                         
          Stillwell and Watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a
          staggering impact. Watts is dazed: Stillwell killed.
                         
          Woozy, she sees the Sleeper step into the Pilot Chamber.
                         
          The door begins to close.
                         
          Watts sees that DAVID's head lies just inside the door. She
          scrambles for it. Too late. The door knits itself into a
          featureless wall before her reaching hand.
                         
          Watts is alone.
                         
                         
                         PILOT CHAMBER
                         
          The Sleeper settles into the pilot's chair: it fuses with
          him, coming alive. A vast display wraps around the walls -
          revealing the hangar outside, the stars, the horizon.
                         
          A mystic view that renders solid matter translucent, painting
          the fabric of reality in raw information.
                         
                         
          PILOT CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          Watts pounds in futile rage against the door.
                         
                          WATTS
           No!
                         
          The Juggernaut shudders as its systems power up.
                         
                         
          EXT. JUGGERNAUT - DUSK
                         
          The floor of the underground hangar begins to rise. The
          landing lights brighten, shining like a beacon into the sky.
           107.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          On the bridge of the Magellan, Janek stares out. In the
          distance the Juggernaut rises out of the ground to eclipse
          the central pyramid.
                         
          Janek squints, trying to understand what he's seeing
                         
          A light races toward the Magellan down the canal: a rover.
                         
                         
          EXT. CANAL - DUSK
                         
          Watts steers the rover recklessly, hands locked on the
          controls. Rifle slung over her shoulder.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          Janek watches the rover come - and the Holloway Alien -
          boneless and white - unfolds itself from the instruments over
          his head.
                         
          Its goblin-shark jaw juts out. Sinks its horrific teeth into
          Janek's right shoulder.
                         
          Janek howls in agony. His right arm is paralyzed by the bite.
          He gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand.
                         
          The Alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat.
                         
          Janek gets the pistol. Flips it in his hand. Fires over his
          shoulder. Two, three rounds...
                         
          The bullets punch easily into the Alien - but the soft flesh
          closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. Its
          teeth tighten.
                         
          Watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. Swings a heavy
          rifle like a bat with all her strength. A crushing impact
          wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils.
                         
          Watts reverses the rifle. Pulls the trigger. A fusillade of
          bullets shreds the Alien's head. It collapses, dead.
                         
          Watts wrenches her helmet off. Rips a first-aid kit from the
          bulkhead and helps Janek to stanch the bleeding of his
          horrific wound. She gets the bleeding stopped. Wraps him in
          bandages.
                         
          Janek will live - but his right arm is useless.
                         
                          JANEK
           Thank you.
           108.
                         
                         
          He looks at the body of the dead Alien, which is sinking into
          the deck plates as acid eats away at the metal.
                         
                          WATTS
           The Juggernaut's lifting. There's a
           living Engineer on board. He's taking
           the ship to Earth.
                         
          Janek blinks at her. Uncomprehending.
                         
                          JANEK
           The others...?
                         
                          WATTS
           Dead. All dead. Janek. We have to stop
           that ship.
                         
          Janek stares out the Bridge window at the hulking Juggernaut
          in its column of light.
                         
          The nightfall storm front is rolling in, a tidal wave of
          darkness on the horizon. A swelling rumble.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're not a gunship.
                         
                          WATTS
           We have to do something. That ship is
           genocide if it gets to Earth...
                         
          Janek stares at her. Makes his decision. Struggles to stand.
                         
                          JANEK
           Get your helmet on.
                         
                          WATTS
           What about you?
                         
          He shakes his head. No. Watts helps him across the Bridge.
          Props him up in the Captain's seat.
                         
                          JANEK
           You'll have to be my hands.
           (stares out at the storm)
           You're sure about this.
                         
          Watts nods grimly. Desperate.
                         
                          WATTS
           Yes.
                         
                          JANEK
           All right.

          He reaches out with his left hand. Flips switches. The ship
          shudders, awakening.

           forward.
                         
          Watts sends the Magellan careening toward the Juggernaut -
          just as the Juggernaut begins to float off the ground.

          ground, as the storm wall sweeps closer.

          coming. His thoughts quicken. An explosion of light.

          The Juggernaut leaps into the sky.
                         
          The Magellan roars through the cyclone of dust in its wake.
          Barely avoids the pyramid. Rakes around in a screaming turn
          and climbs in pursuit, engines howling.

          Janek and Watts strain at the controls together.

           Harder!
                         
          The Magellan rolls into a howling climb. The storm catches up
          to them: wind and dust reducing visibility to zero. Darkness.
                         
          The Magellan's radar finds the Juggernaut. Paints it with
          targeting data on the Bridge window...
                         
          But the Juggernaut climbs too fast. Dwindling.
                         
                          JANEK (CONT'D)
           We can't catch that.

          On the floor, DAVID's eyes open. With his jaw he hitches his
          severed head around. Gets his eyes on the Sleeper.
                         
          In the pilot chair, the Sleeper convulses.
                         
          An ALIEN erupts from his chest. Big as a wolf even at its
          birth. Dark gray, armored, lethal. More hideous than any
          chestburster we've seen. An ULTRAMORPH. It wails hideously.
                         
          The Sleeper dies. The Alien slithers free.
                         
                         
          EXT. JUGGERNAUT (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE THE STORM
                         
          The Juggernaut emerges from the stormclouds into the clear
          upper air - but loses momentum. Staggers through the upper
          atmosphere, control lost.

          Watts, at the Magellan's controls, stares as he Juggernaut
          falters and falls.

          She seizes the precious moment: centers the Juggernaut in the
          Bridge window. Slams the throttle forward.
                         
                         
          EXT. JUGGERNAUT (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE THE STORM
                         
          The Magellan hurtles out of the storm.
                         
          RAMS THE JUGGERNAUT.
                         
          A colossal impact. The Juggernaut tumbles from the sky like a
          stone - intact but crippled.
                         
          The MAGELLAN BREAKS APART -
                         
          The ship's modules scatter. Some whole, others broken. They
          fall back into the storm. The Command Module - including the
          Bridge - falls intact.
                         
          The engine sections rocket away across the chaotic sky.
                         
                         
          INT. COMMAND MODULE
                         
          Janek is strapped into his seat. Watts goes flying. The
          Bridge window shatters, spraying glass spears in a lethal
          barrage across the Bridge.
                         
          Watts picks herself up. Finds the Module in free fall.
          Alarms wail. Lights flash. Escape pods pop open.
                         
          Watts looks at Janek. He is dead in his seat, impaled by a
          lethal fragment of glass.
                         
          The storm wall - a chain of hurricanes - rages below them.
          The command module tumbles back into the winds.
                         
          Watts dives into a coffin-sized ESCAPE POD.
                         
          She PUNCHES OUT.
                         
                         
          EXT. COMMAND MODULE (IN FREE FALL) - DUSK
                         
          Watts's pod - a steel coffin - shoots away on jets through
          the gale.
           112.
                         
                         
          The command module plunges through the storm, tumbling.
          SMASHES AGAINST THE GROUND in ruin.
                         
          The engine pods hurtle to the ground and go nuclear, sending
          walls of fire twisting through the hurricane.
                         
          The shockwaves tumble Watts's escape pod through the air.
                         
                         
          EXT. LV-426 - MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK
                         
          The pod lands, cushioned by a drag chute and retro rockets.
                         
          Watts pops the pod open, rising painfully to her feet in the
          storm. She surveys the destruction in disbelief.
                         
          A deep RUMBLE makes her turn.
                         
          The JUGGERNAUT ROLLS TOWARD HER - on edge -
                         
          A crushing wheel of death, big as a mountain.
                         
          She runs. Like a child in a nightmare.
                         
          The Juggernaut bears down on her.
                         
          She turns aside, trying to get out of its course. Even at a
          dead sprint she barely seems to move, it's so big...
                         
          The Juggernaut wobbles toward her. Slowing.
                         
          Exhausted, Watts collapses, gasping. The Juggernaut rolls to
          the earth, settling like a hoop right around her, Watts in
          the center.
                         
          The winds carry the dust clouds away.
                         
          Watts passes out, dropping her head to the Earth.
                         
                         
                         LATER
                         
          Watts is awakened by a beeping alarm. She looks at her wrist.
          Her suit flashes an oxygen warning: 20 MINUTES REMAINING.
                         
          She looks up.
                         
          The Juggernaut's doors are wide open in front of her.
                         
          The ULTRAMORPH ALIEN emerges from the Juggernaut. As large as
          a man already.
                         
          It sees her.
           113.
                         
                         
          With a sob of terror she pulls herself to her feet and runs.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK
                         
          Watts flees through the storm, across the burning debris
          field. A wilderness of lightning, fire, and twisted metal. A
          thunderstorm with dust instead of rain.
                         
          She looks back through the darkness.
                         
          In a strobe-light flicker of lightning, she sees a gray demon
          approaching through the wreckage.
                         
          She scrambles through a section of ductwork...under a hull
          fragment...running and clambering...
                         
          The Alien hunts her, cat-and-mouse, among the fragments of
          the Magellan: corridors that go nowhere, shattered
          compartments. Jetsam.
                         
          Her eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night:
          searching for a weapon. A hiding place. An answer.
                         
          She stumbles into the remains of the Magellan's laboratory.
                         
          A hypersleep freezer lies on the barren ground. Watts climbs
          inside. Pulls the lid shut.
                         
          The Alien passes by, inches away. She watches it through the
          plexiglass, holding her breath.
                         
          The Alien roots in the wreckage. Finds the rotting Engineer's
          head among the shards of its vat. It begins to feed on the
          head - GROWING as she watches.
                         
          Her suit's oxygen alarm goes off again. 15 MINUTES REMAINING.
          The beeping draws the Alien away from its dead meat.
                         
          Watts is paralyzed.
                         
          The Alien noses closer. Sniffs at the plexiglass case. With
          sudden, horrific violence, it lashes out. Sends the freezer
          flying. Watts tumbles out. Lurches to her feet and runs.
                         
          The Alien follows. Ravening. She leads it a twisting chase
          through fragments of burning metal.
                         
          Watts trips and falls hard. Picking herself up, she sees
          she's tripped over a HULL SAW - the same diamond-bladed tool
          DAVID used to dismantle the terraforming engine.
                         
          She seizes the saw - straining to manage its weight. Hides in
          the hollow of a massive girder.
           114.
                         
                         
          The Alien passes by. Scenting the air. She freezes. Her arms
          trembling with the weight of the saw. Waiting for it to pass.
                         
          Almost it leaves. But a tiny rattle of metal from the
          quivering saw brings it back.
                         
          Out of options, Watts powers up the saw. The blade whines up
          to speed. They lunge at one another in the same moment.
                         
          The diamond blade shears off one of the Alien's claws.
                         
          The monster screams and recoils.
                         
          Its lashing tail sends Watts sprawling. She loses the saw.
                         
          The Alien comes after her, slinking low to the ground,
          injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury.
                         
          Watts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She
          rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh
          with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground.
                         
          Watts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on
          the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips.
                         
          The Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her
          faceplate. Its hideous jaws open.
                         
          With all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her
          leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt.
          Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth.
                         
          The Alien strikes - just as Watts GRABS the saw.
                         
          She meets the Alien's head with the buzzing blade.
                         
          IMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL.
                         
          A gout of green acid onto Watts's helmet.
                         
          The Alien falls aside, thrashing its death-throes, the saw
          still growling.
                         
          Watts sees ACID COMING THROUGH HER HELMET - fast.
                         
          With frantic haste she unlatches her helmet. Wrenches it off
          as it crumples and melts.
                         
          She stands bare-headed in the toxic air. Desperate, she looks
          around with tearing eyes.
                         
          In the distance she sees an intact module of the Magellan.
                         
          She runs for it. Slaps the door switch. Incredibly, it opens.
           115.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS MODULE
                         
          Watts steps inside. The airlock closes behind her.
                         
          She finds herself staring at a grand piano. She's in
          Vickers's suite. Its amenities intact, through the floor's a
          few degrees off level. She takes a breath. Good air.
                         
          She walks around. Turning things on. Lights. Music. Surreal
          comforts. She drinks water from the tap.
                         
          She opens the door to Vickers's secret room. Military space
          suits. Rifles. Ammunition.
                         
          A crackle from the room's intercom.

          DAVID's head lies battered in a dark corner of the wrecked

                          DAVID
           I know you're there. I can hear the

          Watts strips off her space suit wearily. Sits on the bed.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)

          Watts shakes her head wearily.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I think you'll find I can be of use to

          Watts walks to the intercom and switches it off.
           116.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DAY
                         
          The storm has passed. The fragments of the Magellan no longer
          burn. The gray world of LV-426 restored.
                         
          The wreck of the Juggernaut looms in the misty distance.
                         
          Watts walks through the wreckage in a military space suit.
          Rifle on her shoulder. Pistol on her hip.
                         
          She pulls a cargo dolly loaded with salvage.
                         
                         
          EXT. VICKERS MODULE - DAY
                         
          Watts arrives at the Vickers module. The ultramorph Alien's
          head has been fixed like a grisly trophy above the door.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS'S SUITE (SHIPWRECK) - DAY
                         
          Watts strips off her space suit. She helps herself to a glass
          of vodka from the bar.
                         
          A chessboard sits atop the grand piano: a game in progress.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I've decided. Rook takes Bishop.
                         
          Watts nods. Makes the move on the board. Says nothing.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Have you decided? On our arrangement?
                         
                          WATTS
           I'm not going to fix you, DAVID. I
           don't need you. I'll hold out. A ship
           will come.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I'm certain. But who will send it?
           Men? Or Engineers?
                         
          Watts falls silent. She stares unhappily at the chessboard.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Dr. Watts. It's your move.
           117.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - NIGHT
                         
          The massive central pyramid rises in the midst of the
          Engineer complex.
                         
          With a BOOM, a bright beam of light shines forth from its
          peak, punching straight up through the clouds like a laser.
                         
                         
          VARIOUS PYRAMIDS - AROUND LV-426
                         
          Other beams of light erupt from other pyramids. Scorching the
          sky with their brightness.
                         
                         
          EXT. LV-426 ORBIT
                         
          The barren moon hangs in space, its father planet an angry
          red god in the background.
                         
          Two dozen beams of light rise from the moon, visible even
          from space. A beacon. A signal.
                         
          A beginning.
                         
                         
                         
           FADE OUT.
                         
           THE END.

			 FIRST BLOOD II: THE MISSION







				 by

				James Cameron















				 December 22, 1983










FADE IN:

TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT.  V.A. HOSPITAL - DAY

A drab GREEN SEDAN with U.S. ARMY printed on the door
stops at the steps of a fortress-like colonial-style
building.
Iron bars cover the windows.
The lawn sprinklers snap mindlessly to themselves.
A CRT-style printout appears at the bottom of FRAME:

		D-MINUS 117 HRS
		FAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA

ANGLE ON SEDAN

as the doors open and TWO POWERFUL MPs, one of whom was
driving, emerge.  The other opens the rear door for
COLONEL SAMUEL TRAUTMAN who stands, eyeing the imposing
facade of the hospital.
Trautman is in his early fifties and wears the mantle of
command sternly but without arrogance.

He takes the stairs with purposeful strides, the MPs
falling in behind him.

HOLD ON THE SIGN above the main door as they go inside:

		VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL


INT.  HOSPITAL

A gray metal door bearing the sign "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC WING"
bangs open and a massive ORDERLY in white passes through.
He is followed by the two MPs, Trautman, and a SHORT
DOCTOR who hustles to keep up with the others.

LOW ANGLE DOLLY PRECEDING the entourage as they stride
forward.
The MPs are grim-faced and walk in step.

Trautman and a doctor SINGLETERRY silently walk through
the corridor.

They pass the open day-room where somnambulistic patients
sit like statuary watching "The Young and the Restless" or
watching the wallpaper fade.
Bleak light from an overcast day filters through the
barred window.

The vets seem older than their years and although some
show the physical scars of combat, there is no doubt that
the greatest trauma for these men is behind the eyes.

As they pass the open doors of the rooms of the "chronic
ward", haunted eyes turn toward them.

As they approach the nurse's station for the "chronic
ward" the orderly nods.
The HEAD NURSE turns to her console.

INSERT - AS NURSE'S HAND

hits a button on the console.

TIGHT ON SECURITY DOOR

as a solenoid-operated bolt snaps back with a loud BUZZ
CLACK.
The orderly's good hand shoves the door open.

INT.  "VIOLENT" WARD

The entourage enters a long narrow corridor lined with
locked doors.

POV DOLLYING ALONG CORRIDOR

Occasionally faces appear at the safety-glass windows set
in the doors.  Men whose souls have fled.
Their eyes track us as we move past.

An emaciated MAN in an untied hospital smock and bare feet
stands as if lost in the center of the corridor.

REVERSE ON GROUP

DOLLYING as they detour around the man, whose clawlike
hand catches at Trautman's tunic.
A hoarse, demented SHOUTING issues from one of the doors,
a desperate WAILING from another.


INT.  STAIRWELL

CLOSE ON DOOR LATCH as keys RATTLE and the door opens.

WIDER as the group enters a dark service stairwell.  The
single fluorescent light flickers stroboscopically, a
pulsing twilight.

				LEWIS
		Shit.  Maintenance never gets down
		here.

They descend two flights to a door of steel bars on a
sliding track.

The MPs flank Lewis as he unlocks the door.

				SINGLETERRY
		So what am I supposed to do?  Can't
		transfer him to Leavenworth.  He's
		civilian.  So I put him in an
		isolation cell that hasn't been used
		since the Spanish Inquisition.

TIGHT ON BARRED DOOR

rolling aside on metal tracks.  CLANG.


INT.  CORRIDOR

This area of the hospital's basement has been used for
little but storage in recent years.
Stacks of obsolete equipment gathers dust, leaving only a
narrow walkspace.

The steel doors of the isolation cells yawn open, except
for the last one.

				TRAUTMAN
		Maybe you should have tried cutting
		him some slack.

Lewis opens a cabinet near the single locked cell and
removes a SMALL RIFLE.  He feeds a SYRINGE-LIKE SHELL into
the single-shot bolt action.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		What's that?

				SINGLETERRY
		Tranquilizer syrette gun.  Borrowed
		it from the Animal Control
		Department.

Trautman pushes the barrel aside with a contemptuous snort
and steps up to the cell door.

				TRAUTMAN
		Gimme a break.
			(nods toward door)
		Open it.

The two MPs flank the door.  One pulls on the latching
lever.  Bolts slide.  The door swings open, revealing
blackness.

				LEWIS
			(muttering)
		Thinks he's the fucking Prince of
		Darkness.

One MP tries the switch beside the cell, flicking it
several times.  Nothing.

He glances apprehensively at the other MP and they step
into the dark cell.


INT.  CELL

TIGHT ON A HAND, dimly outlined, as it twists a light bulb
a half-turn in its socket.

In the sudden light the MPs face an imposing figure.

JOHN RAMBO, wearing only a pair of filthy jeans, stands
"ready" before them.  The single light bulb on the low
ceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body.
A nasty piece of machinery.

Long, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkempt
beard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which are
deep, reptilian.  Intense.

His position, though not overtly threatening, suggests a
willingness to strike without warning which gives the
M.P.'s pause.

Trautman steps forward between the MPs.

				TRAUTMAN
		At ease, Rambo.

MED. ON RAMBO

rising from his slight crouch to stand composed,
balanced... parade rest.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing to MPs)
		Wait outside.

He closes the door until it latches.

				TRAUTMAN
		Hello, John.

				RAMBO
		Colonel.

				TRAUTMAN
		Mind if I sit down?

Rambo motions to the narrow bunk, dropping into an
Oriental squat himself as the Colonel sits.

Trautman's manner with Rambo is familiar, somehow
paternal.  A bit of an ironic grin twitches briefly.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		I hear you're not enjoying it here.

				RAMBO
		I could take it or leave it.

Trautman sighs and leans back.

				TRAUTMAN
		Seems like I'm always pulling you
		out of some goddamn toilet or other,
		doesn't it?

				RAMBO
		Am I out of here?

				TRAUTMAN
		That depends on you.
			(pause)
		Christ, look at you.  I give you
		this easy duty until I can get you
		an assignment... all you have to do
		is eat ice cream and watch soap
		operas... and you have to make it
		Rambo's last stand.

				RAMBO
		There were treating me like a
		headcase.

				TRAUTMAN
		Hard to believe.  You shoot up one
		little town in Oregon with a fifty
		caliber machine gun... one little
		dogpatch town... and everybody
		figures your wrapper's broken.  No
		sense of humor.
			(pause)
		What did you expect?  An engraved
		plague from the chamber of commerce?

Rambo looks at his hands.  When he finally speaks his
voice seems distant, disembodied.

				RAMBO
		In 'Nam I flew gunships.  Million
		dollar equipment.  Back here nobody
		trusts me to park cars.  I keep
		thinking it's going to be okay...
		but I've been out six years and it's
		not okay.  Sometimes I feel like I'm
		coming right out of my skin.

The colonel nods slowly.  He notices a battered shoebox on
the floor beside the bed.  The cell is absolutely devoid
of personal articles otherwise.

				TRAUTMAN
		This your stuff?

				RAMBO
		That's it.  My life.

TIGHT ON SHOEBOX

as Trautman flips through a number of worn snapshots of
the men in Rambo's special forces unit.

They are horsing around, in and out of uniform.  A
younger, cleanshaven Rambo is among them.  He is grinning
broadly in one shot.
It seems uncharacteristic of the hardened man we see now.

				TRAUTMAN
		Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever
		trained.

				RAMBO
			(coldly)
		Those men are all dead.

				TRAUTMAN
			(glancing up)
		You're not.

He fishes something from among the pathetic debris of
Rambo's life.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		Congressional Medal of Honor.

				RAMBO
			(bitterly)
		Yeah.  Big time.

				TRAUTMAN
		Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars,
		four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's
		Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of
		Gallantry and... uh, a handful of
		Purple Hearts.

				RAMBO
		Five.  I never wanted that stuff.

				TRAUTMAN
		What did you want?

				RAMBO
			(haltingly)
		I just wanted... I don't know...
		after all that... I just wanted one
		person, one person, to come up to me
		and say "you did good, John." And
		mean it.  That's all.
			(pause)
		After all that.

				TRAUTMAN
		You just picked that wrong war to be
		a hero in.

The colonel studies Rambo a moment, then stands abruptly.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		Let's take a walk.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  V.A. HOSPITAL - DAY

Rambo and Trautman cross the manicured grounds, escorted
by the two grim MPs.

A number of wheelchair-bound vets enjoy the sunshine B.G.
and a desultory game of volleyball is in progress.

Still, the impression is of the detritus of war left
scattered on a huge lawn like broken toys.

As the two approach a conservatively dressed MAN waiting
on a bench under a plane-tree, stands.

				TRAUTMAN
		Jason Kirkhill... John Rambo.

Kirkhill extends his hand in greeting, but Rambo coolly
half-turns to reveal his hands, locked in WRIST-CUFFS
separated by a steel bar so that they can hang comfortably
at his sides.
Kirkhill grins affably.  Drops his hand.

				KIRKHILL
		Good to meet you, Rambo.  How are
		you?

Rambo scans Kirkhill's face, noting the cold scrutiny all
but concealed in the smile lines.

				RAMBO
			(coldly)
		You a spook?

Kirkhill drops the smile.

				KIRKHILL
		That's right.  CIA Special
		Operations Division.

Rambo turns to Trautman.

				RAMBO
		I don't work with spooks.  Not after
		that op in Cambodia.

				KIRKHILL
		I'm authorized to get you out of
		here.  I thought that's what you
		wanted.

				RAMBO
			(considering)
		What's the job?

				KIRKHILL
		Classic special forces op... hit
		fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two
		days.

				RAMBO
		Why me?

				KIRKHILL
			(shrugs non-
			 committally)
		We like you.
			(pause)
		At least the computer at Langley
		likes you.  Pulled your file because
		of various factors.  Service record.
		Area familiarity.

				RAMBO
		Where?

				KIRKHILL
		Not yet.

				RAMBO
		I'm not jumping blind.

Kirkhill's eyes get hard.

				KIRKHILL
		It's yes or no.  In or out... now.
		If it's "out," we will not have had
		this conversation.  If you come in,
		you will not be working for us.  No
		knowledge.  No comment.  Do you
		understand?

Rambo seems about to turn away.

				TRAUTMAN
			(to Kirkhill)
		Tell him.  I'll take responsibility.

Kirkhill looks pained, like he has gas.

				KIRKHILL
		North Vietnam.  What they call the
		Democratic Republic of Vietnam now.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

as he takes that in.  His eyes seem to see all the way
there already.  Emotions go through him.  Exhilaration
mixing with terror of the demon he can't turn away from.
He nods slowly.

				TRAUTMAN
		We left some people behind there,
		John... POWs.

				RAMBO
		This just occurred to somebody, now?

				KIRKHILL
		We don't leave our men, Rambo.

Rambo and Trautman lock eyes.
Something flows there... Trautman knows his soul.

				RAMBO
		You got it.  I'm in.

He whips one hand around from his side, tossing the
manacle bar at a surprised Kirkhill's feet.
The wrist-cuffs are still closed.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  RAMBO'S CELL

Rambo stands alone in his cell, the door open behind him.
He hefts the shoebox filled with his worldly possessions,
the scraps of memory, dead friends, and symbols of valor
and violent death.

He upends the box, spilling everything into the open
toilet.

Flushes it.  And walks out.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  FORT BRAGG - DUSK

		D-MINUS 84 HRS
		FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA

TIGHT ON BOOTED FEET

clomping in rhythmic lockstep as a platoon of recruits
marches past in close order drill.
The drill sergeant bellows cadence.

				SERGEANT (O.S.)
		Three-fo-your-lef, lef-right-lef...
		Other lef shithead!  Square those
		pieces away... square 'em away
		girls!  I said...

WIDER

as the platoon marches past, EXITING FRAME to reveal a
sign mounted beside a security checkpoint in a formidable
chain-link fence.

		AIRBORNE SPECIAL FORCES GROUP
			 OPERATIONS CENTER


INT.  CORRIDOR

Kirkhill, accompanied by his basilisk-eyed AIDE, strides
past Rambo's two MPs flanking the door, into a small
room.


INT.  BRIEFING ROOM

The room is an austere cubicle with the army's typically
drab furniture in "early functional."
The cold eye of a surveillance camera stares down at a
single table with a seated figure... Rambo, looking like
he may have been there for centuries.

The aide hands Rambo a sealed folder and extends a
clipboard and pen for him to sign off.

				KIRKHILL
		This is your mission packet...

				AIDE
			(quietly overlapping)
		Sign here, please.  And here.

				KIRKHILL
		Memorize it here.  It doesn't leave
		this room.

Rambo unseals the folder, removing a sheaf of photocopied
documents, as Kirkhill perches on the table next to him.

				KIRKHILL
			(continuing)
		The twenty-four hundred American
		servicemen missing in action in
		Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are
		officially listed "Presumed
		Killed." Certainly most of them
		are.

Rambo is leafing through the contents of his PACKET.  He
skips a stack of reports and fishes out several grainy 8 X
10 prints.

				KIRKHILL
			(continuing)
		But reports keep filtering in.
		Sightings by refugees.  Nothing
		verified.  Finally, we feel we've
		got enough to proceed on.

Rambo studies the prints.  They seem to be high altitude
surveillance photos of a small COMPOUND OF BUILDINGS,
surrounded by forests.

				KIRKHILL
			(continuing)
		Memo E-7 on top will cover the
		details.  An abandoned Vietnamese
		Army base in the North-central
		highlands may have a compound used
		as an internment camp.  As you can
		see the intelligence is soft.  These
		LANDSAT photos show huts...
		barracks.  It could be anything.

				RAMBO
			(flat)
		What's the plan?

				KIRKHILL
		This operation is in two phases.
		Recon and rescue.  You are phase
		one.  Your two-man team will probe
		the site, confirm the presence of
		American POWs, if any, make
		photographic and tactical
		observations, then proceed to the
		extraction point without engaging
		the enemy.

				RAMBO
		We don't try to pull out any of our
		guys if we find them?

				KIRKHILL
		Negative.  Absolutely not.  The
		phase two assault team will get them
		out.

				RAMBO
			(not pleased)
		We just take pictures?

				KIRKHILL
		Don't look so disappointed.  It
		should be hairy enough... even for
		you.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  DON MUANG AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON

Kirkhill's VOICE continues over the image of: The crowded
airport terminal, as Rambo, carrying a cheap flight bag,
weaves among jostling Orientals.

				KIRKHILL (V.O.)
		Your flight to Bangkok is at 06:30.
		Commercial carrier.  Low profile.
		Rendezvous with Colonel Trautman at
		the Indra.  Room 618.  You'll meet
		your number two man, Lieutenant
		Brewer.  He doesn't get a packet...
		you brief him verbally.

After a flurry of passport stamping Rambo clears customs
and makes his way to the main exit.


EXT.  TAXI STAND - STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Rambo emerges into the stifling humid heat of Bangkok in
May and stands, scanning for a cab.

		D-MINUS 51 HRS
		BANGKOK, THAILAND

Bangkok is a city of fervid motion and the street is
chaotic with traffic.
Stepping through throngs of Asians and tourists Rambo
reaches for the door of a beat-to-hell Citroen taxi
hunkered low at the curb like some metal lungfish.

He spins as a hand lightly touches his shoulder.

				MAN
		Sorry old buddy, I saw it first.

An American in his late twenties, the man speaks with one
of those hard-to-dislike Southern accents.  Probably North
Carolina.
He is lanky but muscular, with boyish good looks and hair
cut so short it barely qualifies as stubble.  Though
dressed in a loud Hawaiian shirt and Madras slacks, it is
painfully obvious the man is military.

His arm is draped around a gorgeous but overly made-up
Thai girl.

				MAN
			(affable)
		I kinda got an important date.

Rambo's eyes narrow as he turns wordlessly and climbs into
the taxi.

The American grins cockily and tosses his bag to Rambo.

				MAN
		No problem.  We'll share it.  Get
		your tail in there, sweet thing.


INT./ EXT.  TAXI

The American and the girl pile into the broad front seat,
to the chagrin of the lizard-faced Thai driver.

				MAN
			(to driver)
		Indra Hotel.  And don't take the
		scenic route, Smiley... I know my
		way around this burg.  Comprende?

Rambo speaks quietly to the driver in Thai.

				RAMBO
			(Thai/subtitled)
		Same place for me.

The girl giggles as the American slips his hand up from
her stockinged knee, between her thighs.

				MAN
		Ah, you fair flower of the Orient.

She giggles, like a chirping bird.

				MAN
			(continuing to Rambo)
		She thinks everything I say is
		funny.  Don't you, Angel-pie?  Man,
		Thai women are the best.  Got the
		kinda legs I like... feet at one end
		and pussy at the other.

He turns to Rambo, who hasn't commented or taken any
observable notice of him.

				MAN
			(continuing)
		You don't say a helluva lot, do you,
		pal?  You speak English?

				RAMBO
			(coldly)
		Sometimes.

The girl coos to the American in pidgin English.

				THAI GIRL
		You got money?  I stay you whole
		week.

				MAN
		Sweet thing, there's nothin' I'd
		like more than to wugga-wugga with
		you for a week, but tonight's all we
		got.

He lowers his voice conspiratorially, leaning close to
her.

				MAN
			(continuing)
		See, I'm on this secret mission, and
		tomorrow mornin' I head out to...

Rambo grabs the man brutally by his collar.

				RAMBO
		That's enough, Brewer.

The American freezes at the sound of his name.  Turns
slowly.

				BREWER
			(realizing)
		You're Rambo?
			(pause)
		Ke-rist!

Rambo speaks sharply to the girl in Thai.

				RAMBO
			(Thai/subtitled)
		Get out.  Now!

The driver, confused, skids to a stop and the girl gets
out into the din of a cluttered shop district.  A flash of
slit skirt and then only fading curses behind them as the
taxi moves on.

				BREWER
			(brightening)
		Jeez, I never would have guessed.
		You undercover, Lieutenant?  Great
		disguise.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  INDRA HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

Trautman, sipping a gin tonic at the window, spins around
as the door flies open.  Brewer storms in, followed a few
paces back by Rambo, who closes the door.

				BREWER
			(to Trautman)
		He says he's team leader on this
		show.

				TRAUTMAN
		That's correct.

				BREWER
			(controlling his
			 fury)
		Begging the Colonel's pardon but I
		understood I was up to lead my next
		mission.

				TRAUTMAN
		Not this one.  You're on
		communications and camera.  Same
		image-intensified gear you used in
		El Salvador last year.

				RAMBO
		This clown almost blew mission
		security on the street.  I'm not
		jumping with him.

				BREWER
			(spinning)
		Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...

				TRAUTMAN
			(sharply)
		Listen up.  You two are married as
		of now.  Get used to it.

				RAMBO
			(to Trautman)
		I say we tape him to a chair.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  OPERATIONS BASE CAMP - DAY

		D-MINUS 36 HRS
		BAN BUNG KHLA, THAILAND

A small airstrip transects a meadow bounded by rain-
forested slopes.  Wreathed in low clouds the mountains
march into the distance in increasingly subtler shades of
gray like a Japanese watercolor.

Near a cluster of small buildings the scene is one of
manic but efficient activity as the high tech base camp is
assembled.

An enormous SIKORSKY CH-54 "SKY CRANE" lowers a Winnebago-
sized conex container as another roars by.  An Army Corps
of Engineers work crew, stripped to the waist, scurries
through the rotor wash.  The blasting air raises curtains
of muddy spray and drowns out the yelled commands of the
supervisors.

A Vietnam era HUEY UH-1D HELICOPTER nimbly touches down
nearby.  Rambo, in the pilot's seat, slips off his HEADSET
and climbs down.  Brewer and Trautman, in fatigues, jump
out and join him as Kirkhill approaches.

DOLLYING WITH THEM as they emerge from the rotor noise and
Kirkhill motions them toward the MOBILE TACTICAL
OPERATIONS CENTER (MTOC).

				KIRKHILL
		I didn't know you were a stick man,
		Rambo.

				RAMBO
		I was crossed-trained in gunships.

				TRAUTMAN
			(to Kirkhill)
		How long have you been setting up?

				KIRKHILL
		About 22 hours on site.

				TRAUTMAN
		Nice work.

They pass a tent-like CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY under which an
ALL-BLACK SIKORSKY UH-60 "BLACKHAWK" HELICOPTER squats
ominously.  It has no markings or insignia.
There is another canopy behind it, the contents of which
are screened from view.

Nearby is a cluster of CONEX AIRLIFT CONTAINERS, two of
which are joined together to form a building like a
double-wide mobile home.

Another unit contains a roaring generator, a fourth is
topped by TRACKING GEAR.  Cables snake through the mud,
connecting the units.

Kirkhill notices THREE WORK PARTY "GRUNTS" kibitzing
nearby, taking pictures of each other with a pocket
Instamatic.  He snatches the camera from a surprised young
corporal.

				KIRKHILL
		This is a covert operation,
		numbnuts.

He opens the camera and drops the film in the mud.  The
corporal reaches petulantly for the camera.  Kirkhill
drops it casually in the mud as well.

				KIRKHILL
			(to Trautman
			 entourage)
		Check out the command hut.

He opens the door to the large conex unit and follows the
others inside.


INT.  MTOC

The "hut" turns out to be a humming electronic womb.
In the subdued light banks of VIDEO MONITORS glow, and the
status lights of UPRIGHT COMPUTER UNITS line one wall.
Workstations for TRACKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND LONG-RANGE
COORDINATION create a claustrophobic jumble of modular
equipment racks.

				BREWER
		Mission control!

They wipe their muddy feet and enter the air-conditioned
command center.

Rambo gazes around at the jumble of gear.  He runs his
hand over one console, causing a seated technician to
glare at him.

				RAMBO
		All this is for us?

				KIRKHILL
		That's right.

				BREWER
			(to Rambo)
		They call us the field-unit meat-
		puppets.

INT./ EXT.  CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY - DAY

Rambo and Brewer walk in under an expanse of net
camouflage on poles.
Sunlight streams through the foliage cover, creating
bright mottles on a black object F.G.

CAMERA PULLS BACK and BOOMS UP as Rambo moves forward to
reveal the object as an ALL-BLACK JET.  It is a modified
Gulfstream "Peregrine," a small sleek single-engine
executive model, with all insignia and I.D. numbers
removed.

MED. ON RAMBO AND BREWER

as they consider the aircraft.

				BREWER
		Ever do this from a jet? 

				RAMBO
		No.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		It's easy...

They turn to see a lanky long-haired man in a leather
flying jacket duck under the fuselage from the far side
and approach them.

				MAN
			(grinning)
		Just have to jump fast.

Two other air crewmen jump down from the open rear
passenger door of the plane.

				RAMBO
		You the pilot?

				MAN
			(extending hand)
		Yeah.  Doyle.
			(he gestures to the
			 two in the door)
		Lifer and Fuhrman.

Doyle is a product of the sixties' school of ultra-cool,
his brain a little torched by too many methed-out night-
missions.
Fuhrman, the co-pilot, grins too much and Lifer's eyes are
just plain scary.

				RAMBO
		You boys Air Force?

				DOYLE
		Marines.  'Ex' though.  We're
		private contractors now.

				LIFER
		You ever do a tour 'in-country'?

				RAMBO
		Two.  'Eye-corps' mostly.

				DOYLE
			(to Brewer)
		How about you?

				BREWER
			(defensive)
		Vietnam was a little before my time.
		So was Korea, know what I mean?

Rambo and Doyle glance at each other... solidarity before
new-meat bozos.


EXT.  CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY

DETAIL ON THE GROUND

as the head of a torque-wrench finishes a rough map of
local Southeast Asia, scratched hastily in the dirt.

				DOYLE (O.S.)
		Thailand.  The Mekong.  Laos.  'Nam.

With each word he plops the torque-wrench onto the
appropriate place.

ON DOYLE

Gesturing as he continues.

				DOYLE
		A straight dash across the Laotian
		panhandle, through the Annamese
		Mountains... some good dicey bits
		there... and on to the drop zone.
		Eighteen minutes each way in
		communist airspace.

				RAMBO
		We go low to stay off radar?

				DOYLE
		In the rhubarb, babe.

				FUHRMAN
			(grinning)
		Mowin' the lawn.

				LIFER
		Dig it.


INT.  MOTC - COMMAND HUT

Trautman, looking a bit uncomfortable in Kirkhill's
electronic lair, paces behind the seated Special
Operations Officer.

				TRAUTMAN
		How long before you're fully on
		line?

				KIRKHILL
		Couple hours.  Let me buy you a
		coffee.

He turns to a vending machine nestled improbably between
two racks of electronics.

				TRAUTMAN
		You think they'll find any?

				KIRKHILL
			(feeding in change)
		POWs?  I don't know.  But either
		way it'll get that subcommittee off
		our necks.  Cream?

				TRAUTMAN
		Black.  No sugar.

				KIRKHILL
		The League of Families leans on
		Congress.  Then they lean on us.
		Like we don't have enough to worry
		about in a dozen dirtwater
		countries.  Damnit!

He pounds the machine, which refuses to vend.
Trautman watches the Special Operations Officer banging
ineffectually on the COIN RETURN, amid a million dollars
worth of equipment.


EXT.  FLIGHT TENT

A tent next to the camouflage canopy serves as a flight
shack for Doyle and his ground crew.  Crates serve as
tables and stools, and 50-gallon fuel drums are the back
wall.
Doyle, with Rambo and Brewer, continues the game plan.

				DOYLE
		A couple klicks from insertion we go
		vertical to ten thousand and you
		punch out.  Navigate in free fall
		like a regular HALO jump.  You'll
		have a good moon.

				LIFER
			(to himself)
		I got your moon right here...

				BREWER
		No problem.  Duck soup.

Doyle notices that Brewer has casually lit up a cigarette.

				DOYLE
		Hey, man... we got fuel on the deck.
		I don't like flying without a plane.

Brewer glances at the pool of jet fuel around the pumping
area.
Rambo plucks the cigarette from Brewer's lips.

				RAMBO
		No smoking on this mission.  It's
		not healthy.

He looks Brewer in the eye and flicks the lit butt into
the pool of gas.
Which puts it out.

				BREWER
		Son of a bitch!

Rambo saunters away.

				DOYLE
			(appreciatively)
		Nice trick.  Works nine times out of
		ten.


EXT.  BASE CAMP - RUNWAY - DUSK

The steel planking of the pre-fabricated runway rings
under their feet as Rambo and Brewer run laps.  Brewer,
between breaths, is chanting a monologue as they draw
near.

				RAMBO
		Again.

				BREWER
		Insertion.  Call in to base camp by
		TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango
		November for rendezvous with our
		ground contact.  Indigenous agent.
		Co Phuong Bao.
			(in same tone)
		We've been over this three times.

				RAMBO
		You stopped.

Brewer rolls his eyes.

				BREWER
		Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us
		twelve klicks upriver to target at
		Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!

				RAMBO
			(flatly)
		Start over.


EXT.  BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Face-down in the dirt near the flight-line, Rambo and
Brewer are banging off pushups under the floodlight.

				BREWER
			(mechanically)
		... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We
		probe the site...

				RAMBO
			(to himself
			 overlapping)
		Ninety.

				BREWER
		... then proceed downriver to
		extraction at point Echo Delta.
		Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we
		all live happily ever after and
		that's the last time, Rambo!  I
		swear to Christ.

				RAMBO
		One hundred.

They both collapse, face-down, breathing heavily.  Brewer
rises first.

				BREWER
		Gettin' old, huh?

				RAMBO
		Yeah.
			(pause)
		Second set.  Let's go.

When Rambo rises it is in pushup position, only this time
using one arm.  He starts.  One, two, three...


INT./ EXT.  EQUIPMENT TENT - DAY

		D-MINUS 11 HRS

Brewer lifts an OLIVE-DRAB BOX onto the table inside the
open-tent.  It looks like a large field radio with a
complex console set in the top.

				BREWER
		Transponder-satellite relay.
		TRANSAT.

He taps a small collapsible DISH ANTENNA on a tripod
connected to the box by a curly-cord.

				BREWER
			(continuing)
		The signal's coded into infrared
		pulses, picked up by the spy
		satellite, bounced to the ground
		station in Okinawa and relayed to
		the hut...

He points to the MTOC nearby.

				BREWER
			(continuing)
		No radio source.  Nothing for the
		bad guys to triangulate on.

				RAMBO
		Show me how it operates.

				BREWER
		That's what I'm here for.

				RAMBO
		Show me in case you get zapped as
		soon as we land.

				BREWER
			(frustrated)
		We're leaving tonight, not in a
		week.

He sees Rambo's expression.

				BREWER
		Alright.  Alright.


INT.  RAMBO'S TENT - DUSK

Rambo sits on his cot hunched over some minute work.

With surgical precision he hones the trigger mechanism of
a FLAT-BLACK CROSSBOW PISTOL.

revealing Brewer surrounded by shipping crates.  He sets
the scope on a long empty table and attacks another crate,
working under a harsh fluorescent lighting unit.

SEVERAL CLOSE ANGLES - JUMP CUTS

Brewer pulls electronic test gear out of bubble-pack and
sets the units on the table.

He hefts an automatic rifle and checks the action.

Another electronic gadget joins the growing array on the
table.

Another, smaller automatic, a MAC-10 MACHINE PISTOL, is
lifted out of packing.

CLOSE as Brewer's hands thread a silencer onto the barrel

Brewer is calibrating his STARLIGHT-SCOPE image-
intensifier using a wave-form oscilloscope.
Satisfied, he begins mounting it atop the assault rifle.


INT.  RAMBO'S TENT

VERY TIGHT ON RAMBO, working in almost total darkness,
streaking his face with two shades of green camouflage
makeup.
The effect is unearthly.


INT.  EQUIPMENT CONEX

Brewer, wearing headphones, is running a calibration tone
through the audio-processor of his TELESCOPIC MICROPHONE.
He clamps it onto the assault rifle.

TIGHT ON RAMBO'S HANDS

covered with green greasepaint.
Using a candle he expertly darkens the blade of his Lile-

Brewer is standing at the end of the long table which is
now laid out like a banquet with an incredible assortment
of gadgets, weapons, supplies, kits, canteens, rations,
etc.

Doyle lounges nearby watching the bugs dog-fighting around
the fluorescent work light.

				RAMBO (O.S.)
		You jumping with all that?

They turn to see Rambo watching them from just outside the
pool of light.
A spectral figure.

Brewer glances at the array of stuff.

				BREWER
		Yeah.  Why not?

				RAMBO
		You break your leg, I'll have to
		shoot you.

He turns and vanishes in the dark.

				DOYLE
		I think he means it.

				BREWER
		Crazy fucker.

				DOYLE
		Well, son.  You got that right.
		Anybody ever tell you about that

Brewer turns quizzically toward him.

				BREWER
		What about him?

INT.  VAN

Total blackness, until light spills in from the opening

Rambo sits, statue-like, hands on knees, wearing a BLACK
BLINDFOLD.  Adjusting his eyes for night vision.  He's
dressed for the mission: tiger stripe cammies, jump pack,
chute pack, hands and face mottled with camouflage
greasepaint.  Ferocious looking.  Demonic.

Rambo is led to the seat next to Brewer's.  Trautman helps
Lifer strap him in.  Plugs in his intercom jack.

Brewer eyes him cautiously.
He'd move away but all the other seats have been removed.

Moonlight filters down through the foliage of massive
trees, showing as shafts in the swirling night mists.

This is one of the most primeval forests on the planet, a
place of violent growth and death-filled shadows.

Massive tree roots grip the earth, entwined with vines
that climb swaying into the vaulted canopy above.  Water
drips constantly.

And life is everywhere.  Furtive.  Timeless.  Churning in
the shallow pools, under the bark, in the sweating
fruit... leaping through the matted foliage above.

A FIGURE rises behind a rotting log, like a being from
interstellar space.  Rambo removes his goggles and
headset, then shrugs out of his chute harness.

He looks around slowly.  Taking it in.

				RAMBO

		Man, what are you doing back here?

Brewer's voice is a reedy chirp from his headset.  He
raises it to his ear.

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - BARNYARD

Brewer is face-to-face with a mangy PIG, which grunts its
annoyance.
He is stuck up to his knees in the mud of a small fenced
yard containing a few pigs and chickens.

The yard is adjacent to a large THATCH HUT, and four or
five additional HOOTCHES are visible farther downslope,
nestled among the trees.

Brewer holds a finger to his lips, cautioning the pig to
silence.  He lays backward in the black slop as a
VIETNAMESE MAN in peasant pajamas comes to the door of the
nearest hootch, an island of light in the dark forest.

Smoking a cigarette he looks around, perhaps scanning for
the source of the faint crashing he heard a moment before.

Following a dirt road, little more than a trail between
the hootches, an OLD WOMAN approaches.  She is barefoot,
and pushes a rusting bicycle laden with an enormous bundle
of firewood.

Brewer struggles to free himself, straining in silence as
the pigs step disdainfully around him.

The man flicks away the cigarette.  He laughs raucously at
something the old woman says and hurries to help her carry
the firewood inside.

Brewer looks up, at his chute billowing quietly in the
branches overhead.

The old woman pauses at the door, spits a shot of betelnut
juice into the yard, and goes inside.
The door bangs shut.

TIGHT ON BREWER

sighing with relief.

SUDDENLY A DARK OBJECT SHOOTS INTO FRAME, seizing him.
Brewer's head snaps around.  The object is Rambo's hand,
painted camo-green.

Rambo drags him with a sucking POP from the mud.

The Team Leader glares.

				RAMBO

		That's one.

Brewer pauses a moment, assimilating the implicit warning.
Then reaches for his harness buckles to free himself.

With the hootches visible B.G., Rambo moves silently off
along the trail.
Brewer, lumbering under the enormous pack, CRASHES through
foliage to catch up.  He curses under his breath.

Rambo moves wraith-like through the undergrowth, appearing
and vanishing, there... then not there.

Brewer stumbles over a root, THUDS to the ground.

Rambo stops, looking back.  His expression grim.
He turns and moves on, disappearing into the foliage.

Brewer scrambles up, following.

He glances at Brewer who has finished assembling his
weapons and gear.

REVERSE ON BREWER

He is sighting through the scope of his assault rifle.
Fully assembled it is as big as a Chrysler and looks

earphones.

				RAMBO
		What's this?

				BREWER
		AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic

Rambo gazes around him.

				RAMBO
		Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.

		Where's your stuff?

Rambo flips open his rucksack.

				BREWER
			(incredulous)
		That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a

				RAMBO
		There's a compass in the handle.

Brewer gestures at the Russian-made AK-47 slung over
Rambo's shoulder.

				BREWER
		And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every
		twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of
		those.

				RAMBO
		Exactly.

Brewer hefts the separate rucksack containing the TRANSAT.

				BREWER
		Uh... this thing's pretty heavy.
		You got room for it?

Rambo snorts disgustedly.

				BREWER
		Just a thought.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Using a stream bed to navigate through dense growth, Rambo
glides his legs smoothly through knee-deep brackish water.
Brewer follows, swatting and batting at clouds of
mosquitos.

A VIPER glides past them, roiling the surface, and
disappears into twisted tree roots.

				BREWER
		You wanna know why I stood up for
		this show?

				RAMBO
			(moving off)
		No.

				BREWER
		I was in the brig.  They gave me a
		deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf
		cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it
		or anything... it was the symbolic
		value.  Seemed like a good idea at
		the time.

				RAMBO
		That's a real good reason to wind up
		in 'Nam.

				BREWER
		I've seen worse places.

				RAMBO
		There are no worse places.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - LATER

Rambo leads them up a steep trail as a dense NIGHT FOG
creeps over the ridgeline above.

FOLLOWING RAMBO - HANDHELD

as he moves along a narrow game trail.
Shapes loom out of the mist, revealed as harmless trunks
or vines only at the last second.

As they top the rise, the trail opens out onto a plateau-
like cleared area.

Ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE FACE, wreathed in vines, looms
from the mist.

WIDER

as the two walk into the atrium of a RUINED "WAT", or
BUDDHIST TEMPLE.  Brewer looks awed.


EXT.  RUINS OF WAT

Serene despite the ravages of centuries, two stone Buddhas
thirty feet tall sit flanking the stairs to the ruined
temple.  Trees and vines all but obscure the cracked and
tumbled forms of ornately carved walls.

The central courtyard is open to the sky.  Spire-like
structures are dimly visible in the fog beyond.

				BREWER
			(hushed)
		This place is a trip.

				RAMBO
		Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth

				BREWER
		Damn!  Leeches.

He has pulled up his pant-leg to reveal THREE SQUIRMING
BLACK WORMS attached to his calf, sucking on him.

Rambo moves off, scanning, unconcerned.

				RAMBO
		Get used to 'em.

TIGHT ON BREWER

Stomps it out.

				BREWER

				RAMBO
		No cigarettes.

Rambo takes the pack from Brewer's breast pocket and
grinds it into the mud under his boot.

				BREWER
		Look, Rambo.  I've had enough of
		your bad-ass Indian-scout bullshit.
		You're years out of date... I'm
		makin' a career out of teaching you
		the hardware.  As far as I'm
		concerned you're just along to back
		me up.  And I heard about you...
		about how twitchy you really are.
		Kill any civilians lately?

Brewer is hurled against a stone wall and pinned with a
knife to his throat so rapidly he's not sure how it
happened.  Rambo is in his face, speaking very softly.

				RAMBO
		Listen real careful, freshmeat.  I
		don't know why they sent you.  Maybe
		they didn't want to waste a good
		man.  But you screw up once more and
		I'll kill you myself.

Rambo whips away, moves quietly off.

Shaking with rage, Brewer levels his weapon at Rambo's
back.  Then he realizes how silly that would be.
Frustrated, he jogs to catch up.

				BREWER
		Man, are you strict.

Moving in the shadows, Rambo walks through the ruins
noiselessly.  A voice emerges from the mist behind them,
an almost childlike lilt.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		You are first tourist here in long
		time.

Brewer whips around, centering the AIMING DOT of his
sighting laser on a FIGURE sitting on a ledge above them.

Sitting cross-legged and unperturbed is a diminutive
VIETNAMESE WOMAN of about 28.  The dot of Brewer's laser
is centered on her forehead like a Hindu prayer mark.

She is absolutely beautiful, with wide, calm eyes and
strong but sensuous mouth which curves now in a small
quirky grin.

				WOMAN
		You come here see Buddha... ask for
		truth?  Or just lost?

				BREWER
			(whispering)
		Should I waste her?

Rambo pushes his rifle barrel aside and takes a step
forward.  When he speaks it is in FLUENT VIETNAMESE.

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		I'm not lost.  Just looking for
		someone.

				WOMAN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Someone called maybe 'Night Orchid'?

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		That's right.

				WOMAN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		I'm Co Phuong Bao.

				RAMBO
			(to Brewer)
		She's our contact.

				BREWER
			(grudgingly
			 impressed)
		I didn't know you spoke Vietnamese.

Co slides down from the ledge and stands before them,
almost two heads shorter than Rambo.  Her lithe figure is
not entirely concealed by her loose black "pajamas".  She
wears her hair in a long single braid and has the delicate
hands of a child.

				RAMBO
		I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.
			(to Brewer)
		Her name is Co.

				CO
		It means "virgin."  My mother was
		comedian.

				BREWER
		Howdy, Co.

He sticks out his hand but Rambo motions "no".  She bows
slightly.

				BREWER
		Uh, you speak pretty good English.
		Where'd you learn?

				CO
		University of Saigon.  Have Masters
		Degree in economics.  Not use too
		much now... Communists in charge.
		You got time... want to eat?

				RAMBO
		Sure.  Whattaya got?

Co reaches up onto the ledge, her previous perch, and
pulls down a small PACK, actually a FOOD TUBE of the sort
worn over one shoulder by Viet Cong and other Vietnamese
guerrillas.

				CO
			(opening it)
		Nuac mam.

She unrolls several rubber tree leaves holding rice with a
pungent sauce.  Rambo takes the food and the proffered
CHOPSTICKS and, squatting, begins shoveling it expertly.

				RAMBO
		You really got a Masters Degree?

				CO
		Sure.  I only sound like forty-year-
		old in your language.

Brewer fumbles with the sticks.  Switches to fingers.

				BREWER
		What's this stuff on the rice?

				RAMBO
		Fermented fish sauce.

Brewer's expression is less than enthusiastic.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - RIVER TRAIL - NIGHT

With Co leading through the maze of aimless game trails
the group makes its way parallel to a modest RIVER, THE
CA.

				RAMBO
		How do we get upriver?

				CO
		I have arranged transportation.  We
		meet soon.  But I think you to be
		disappointed.

				RAMBO
		Why's that?

				CO
		I go up to this camp two months ago.
		Nobody there.  Empty for years.

Rambo stops, puzzled.

				RAMBO
		Why would they send us to a deserted
		camp?

				BREWER
		Who cares?  Let's just do it and get
		out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid
		in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?

Rambo moves on, still concerned.  something's a bit off.

				RAMBO
		We'll check it out.

				BREWER
		How come we didn't just drop near
		the camp... save this hassle?

				RAMBO
		Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?

				BREWER
		Yeah...

				CO
			(switching to Viet
			 subtitled)
		Where did you find this clown?

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		I thought he was with you.

				CO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Crazy motherfucker.

				BREWER
		What's she saying?

				RAMBO
		She likes you.  Says you're dinky-
		dau.

				BREWER
		What's that?

				RAMBO
		Powerful warrior.

				BREWER
		Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey,
		Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one-
		eyed snake?

Rambo motions suddenly for a "freeze".  Co walks on ahead,
toward the river, as the Americans melt into the shadows.


EXT.  RIVER - MARSHY INLET

A HOUSE-SAMPAN wallows among the naked tree roots in a
brackish inlet off the main river.  On deck are TWO MEN,
loosely speaking.  Possibly two of the most misbegotten
specimens the Orient has to offer.

They raise their AK-47s as Co approaches.  Exchange a few
quick syllables and Co turns, motioning Rambo and Brewer
forward.

As they pass, two more equally unwholesome-looking men
emerge from concealment and follow them to the sampan.

Everybody grips their weapons tightly.

				BREWER
			(under his breath)
		These guys look like they'd sell
		their mothers.

				RAMBO
		Sometimes they do.  They're river
		pirates.  Opium runners.

				BREWER
			(hissing)
		Pirates?  No kidding?

Before they step across onto the sampan, Co introduces the
"captain" in Vietnamese.

Wearing all manner of jewelry, including four wristwatches
and a pair of filthy western-style jeans a size too large,
CAPTAIN TRONG KINH grins and motions them aboard.

The grin reveals bare gum where his upper front teeth
would be.  Obviously broken out in a fight.

				CAPTAIN TRONG KINH
		Wa-ky number one.  You come number
		one sampan.

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Thank you, Captain, for your
		hospitality.  You speak English very
		well.

Grinning wider, Captain Kinh motions them inside the
CABIN, a rambling and dilapidated structure of corrugated
sheet metal and woven bamboo.

Kinh barks orders at his men, who cast off from their
moorings and jump aboard.  The first light of dawn is
breaking through the trees.


INT.  SAMPAN CABIN

A raisin-faced WOMAN in an ao-dai, holding an infant,
shuffles aside as Rambo steps down into the dim smoky
interior.
Brewer, Co and Kinh follow.

The two Americans must stoop in the scaled-down structure.
Every conceivable space is crammed with scavenged or
looted detritus: ammo cases, hubcaps, radios, a TV with no
back, books, dead chickens, an ice-cube tray, a Toyota
bumper, outboard motors... there is no operant logic to
most of it.

				BREWER
		Looks like my room in college.

				CO
		We sleep here today.  Safe here
		while go up river.

				RAMBO
		What about patrol boats?

Kinh opens a greasy wooden locker, takes out his pride and
joy, a Russian-made RPG-7 ROCKET-GRENADE LAUNCHER.

His grin glistens evilly in the gloom.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  BASE CAMP - DAWN

A beautiful sunrise backs the treeline, stretching long
shadows across the quiet camp.


INT.  KIRKHILL'S TRAILER

The interior resembles that of a motor home, complete with
bunks, kitchenette and a small bar.

Kirkhill is on the phone, pacing... agitated.  His
reptilian aide lounges on a bunk.

				KIRKHILL
			(to phone)
		No, sir... we're already committed.
		They're in the jungle right now.  I
		say we play the hand through... if
		they find something we just bury the
		report later.  It's still airtight.
			(pause)
		Yes, sir.

He hangs up.  Runs a hand through his hair.

				KIRKHILL
			(to aide)
		Goddamn it!  Now the goddamn
		satellite shows the camp occupied...
		some trucks or something.

				AIDE
			(grimly)
		Oh, boy.  It's getting dicey.

Their manner becomes guarded when a KNOCK at the door
interrupts them.
The aide unlocks it and admits Trautman.

				KIRKHILL
		What's up?

				TRAUTMAN
		Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a
		fifth wheel in your setup here... I
		thought I'd go out with the
		extraction team tonight.  Unless you
		have an objection.

				KIRKHILL
			(not liking it)
		It's not necessary.

				TRAUTMAN
		I know.

				KIRKHILL
		That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full
		Colonels are supposed to be above
		that sort of thing.

Trautman is calling him on it with a deadpan response.

				TRAUTMAN
		I know...

				KIRKHILL
			(shrugs expansively)
		Have fun.


EXT.  CA RIVER - DAY

Kinh's hideous sampan churns upriver slowly, powered by an
ancient outboard motor.  It passes other river traffic,
small hand-powered sampans manned by figures in broad
conical coolie hats.

With the exception of a rare powered craft, the scene is
that of a Vietnam unchanged by centuries.  The ebb and
flow of regimes and ideologies has little altered the
basics of life here.


INT.  SAMPAN

Rambo watches through a chink in the sheeting of the cabin
as the timeless landscape rolls past.

RAMBO'S POV

A view of the shoreline as brown children splash naked in
the shallows where a row of hootches marches up the hill
on stilts.  The SQUEALS and LAUGHTER come clearly across
the water.

Rambo turns his gaze to the sampan interior.
Two of Kinh's men, Co and Brewer all sleep soundly.

Rambo watches Co, her face serene in sleep.  Childlike.
Beautiful.

							 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  CA RIVER - LATE AFTERNOON

The water is coppery, silhouetting the sampan as it churns
on.

Kinh's wife squats on the foredeck, smoking a long-stemmed
clay pipe.

							 DISSOLVE TO:

INT./ EXT.  SAMPAN - SUNSET

The walnut-faced woman hands Rambo two bowls of nuoc mam.
He passes one to Brewer.

				RAMBO
		Have some armpit sauce.

Brewer groans.  Opens a C-ration can.

				RAMBO
			(to Co)
		How did you get started working for
		the spooks?

				CO
		Spooks?

				RAMBO
		Intelligence work.

				CO
		Oh.  They talk to me at university
		before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.

				BREWER
		Everybody's makin' deals.

				CO
		My brother captain in ARVN... need
		papers to go United States, or North
		Vietnamese will execute.  They make
		deal... I stay here and do work...
		my brother and my son can go United
		States.

				RAMBO
		Your son?

Co's eyes drop and her whole demeaner deflates slightly.

				CO
		Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him
		for eight years.

				RAMBO
		Where's his father?

Co shrugs.

				CO
		Dead.  Killed in war.

Her voice and expression convey the fatalistic acceptance
of one who has seen death in all its forms.  Expects it as
an element of daily life.

				RAMBO
		Where's Nguyen now?  What city?

				CO
			(noting his concern)
		Huntington Beach, California.

				RAMBO
		It's nice there.  He's probably
		digging every minute.  Got a
		surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.

				CO
			(distractedly)
		Nguyen is good boy.

Co gazes at the sunset beyond the door.  A tear runs down
her cheek.  She catches herself.  Wipes it away almost
brutally.  She abruptly goes on deck.

				BREWER
		Some hardened guerrilla fighter they
		gave us.

Rambo freezes him out with an evil look.
Suddenly there is a commotion on deck.  The roar of a
powerful ENGINE.  Co bursts in a moment later.

				CO
		River patrol!

A FAST LAUNCH roars toward them, silhouetted by the
setting sun.  UNIFORMED SOLDIERS on deck bring twin 50-
caliber machine guns to bear.

Rambo and Brewer dive under filthy bunks.  Lock and load
their weapons.  Co pushes junk in over them.
Kinh rips open the cabinet.  Slams the shaft of a rocket
grenade into the launch tube.

Co barks an order at him.  He hesitates.  Lowers the
weapon.

Co removes a small packet of North Vietnamese bills from
inside her blouse and hands it to Kinh.


EXT.  SAMPAN

The patrol boat pulls up in an arc, almost swamping them.
The soldiers on deck wear the uniforms of the North
Vietnamese navy.

The deck gunner racks the bolt on his R.P.K. MACHINE GUN.
The captain shouts RAPID VIETNAMESE on a loud hailer.

Kinh's men lounge on the sampan indolently, looking like
fishermen on an evening trawl.

The scrawny woman feeds an infant at one sagging breast.

The PATROL CAPTAIN draws his service pistol and jumps down
into the sampan, entering the cabin.
Co sits demurely on one bunk as Kinh greets the officer.

The officer begins poking through Kinh's possessions.
He tugs at the crate under the bunk where Rambo lies
concealed.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

absolutely motionless.  The crate beside his head moves.
The officer's boot is visible through a widening crack.
An ARGUMENT IN VIETNAMESE is heard heating up.

BREWER

grips the MAC-11 tightly, releases, grips, releases.
Sweat runs into his eyes.

THE OFFICER

looks severe as he contemptuously thumbs through a sheaf
of bills.
Kinh, gesticulating pathetically adds some more to the
stack.

After a tense moment the officer kicks the crate next to
Rambo and stalks out, tucking the payola in his tunic.

He jumps off the sampan and the patrol boat ROARS on.


INT.  SAMPAN

Rambo and Brewer allow themselves to exhale.

				RAMBO
		How you doing, Brewer?

				BREWER
			(shaken)
		I need a vacation.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - PRISON CAMP - NIGHT

With Co leading, Rambo and Brewer move furtively along a
tortuous trail.  It has rained recently and the forest is
alive with glistening reflections, dripping water.
The trail winds up a steep embankment.

As they reach the top of the rise, CAMERA BOOMS UP over
the shoulder of the embankment to reveal a COMPOUND
beyond, dark except for moonlight.

RAMBO

watches from concealment in the foliage.  He is invisible
with his camo-makeup except for darting eyes.

RAMBO'S POV

looking between the leaves, scanning the prison camp.

Two shabby WOODEN GUARD TOWERS stand at diagonally
opposite corners of the compound.  There is a simple fence
of barbed wire on wooden posts enclosing the area and a
main gate with a sentry box.
THREE LONG WOODEN BARRACKS form a U, filling most of the
compound.  The place seems deserted.

				RAMBO
		Check the tower with your scope.

Brewer raises the rifle, sighting through the massive
starlight scope.

BREWER'S POV - TELEPHOTO

The image is bright, lurid... black and white with a
greenish cast.  Like contrasty daylight.  He pans up the
tower.  A Russian-made P.K. 7.62mm machine gun sits
pointing skyward.  The tower seems unoccupied.

				BREWER
		Nobody home.  Wait a minute!
		Cigarette.

A brief glow of light illuminates the face of a TOWER
GUARD hidden in shadows.

				BREWER
		What's he here for?

Nearby, another GUARD saunters out of the forest dressed
in NVA regular private's uniform with the sleeves rolled
up casually.  His AK-47 is slung over his shoulder.

BREWER

slips the telescopic microphone out of his rucksack and
clamps it to the side of his scope.

He slips on a pair of small earphones and pans the rifle-
scope-mike over the nearest barracks unit.

				BREWER
			(intently)
		Snoring.  Five, six guys.
		Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody
		talking in his sleep.  A toilet
		flushing.

				RAMBO
		Guard barracks.  Take some shots.

Brewer locks a 35mm SLR camera to an adapter on the
starlight scope.
He starts clicking off some shots.

Brewer then scans the long hut across the compound.

				BREWER
		Breathing.  Moaning.
			(suddenly)
		Shit!

He whips off the earphones in pain as a LOW SCREAM echoes
across the camp.
It fades into a delirious moaning.  Stops.

				RAMBO
			(nodding grimly)
		Bad dreams.  Prisoner's barracks.
		Shoot some.

Brewer clicks away.

A TINY ENGINE WHINING draws their attention to the main
gate where a YOUNG WOMAN on a LAMBRETTA SCOOTER pulls up
to the sentry shack.
Brewer zeros on her as she greets the GATE GUARDS.

				CO
		Cyclo-girl whore from village.
		Business slow there.

Rambo takes the earphones, listening to the girl's distant
chattering.

				RAMBO
		She's making him a pretty good deal.

Apparently the guard agrees because he opens the gate and
the girl slips inside.

				RAMBO
		What's that?  By the far tower.

Brewer pans to the distant shape.

				BREWER
		It's a guy in a cage.

				RAMBO
		American?

				BREWER
		Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real
		scrunched up in that thing.

				RAMBO
		Let me see.

RAMBO'S POV THROUGH SCOPE

The image is of an EMACIATED FIGURE slumped in a bamboo
cage.  The man's skin is ghostly white.  He seems almost a
living skeleton, dressed only in ragged shorts.

His wrists are clamped in a wooden STOCK and blood runs
down his arms from the abraded sores.

THE IMAGE ZOOMS CLOSER, MOVES ONTO HIS FACE.  TIGHT.

Though gaunt and filthy, he is clearly CAUCASIAN.

				RAMBO
		Roundeye.

				BREWER
		Alright.  Home run.

				RAMBO
			(angrily)
		Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't
		sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.

				BREWER
		Bastards.  Let's get some shots.

ON RAMBO

MOVING SLOWLY IN as he hands the kluge back to Brewer.

				RAMBO
		That guy's not going to make it.

				BREWER (O.S.)
		Nothing we can do, man.

Rambo decides in that moment.

				RAMBO
		I'm getting him out.

				BREWER
		What?  Are you crazy?  We're
		supposed to take pictures and split.
		You're gonna blow the whole program.

				RAMBO
		You never been in one of those
		things.

				BREWER
		I suppose you have...

Rambo holds his wrists up, right under Brewer's nose...
showing the chafing scars.

				BREWER
		It's orders!  You remember... when
		they tell you to do something and
		then you do it.  John Wayne is dead,
		man.

				RAMBO
			(rising)
		You take pictures and split.  I'm
		going in.

Brewer throws down his rifle.  He's apoplectic.
He can barely form words.

				BREWER
		Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Aw... ke-rist.

Then a slow grin spreads.

				BREWER
		How we gonna do it?

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  CAMP PERIMETER - LATER

MOVING WITH BREWER as he belly crawls to the edge of the
cleared area, just a few yards from the wire.  He is right
under one tower, hidden among ferns.

BREWER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE

as Rambo's silhouette crosses to the wire farther down.


EXT.  COMPOUND

DOLLYING WITH RAMBO at ground level as he crawls under the
wire and undulates from shadow to shadow.

He reaches the nearest building.  Hugs it.
Rambo moves on in silence.  He is barefoot, the pale skin
smeared with mud, and carries only the PISTOL CROSSBOW.
Without rifle, pack, harness or grenades to clatter, he
moves like a spirit in the material world.

Rambo raises one eye slowly over a window ledge.
Inside several guards sleep soundly under mosquito
netting.  Their rifles are stacked against the far wall.

ANGLE ON GUARD

snoring ludicrously loud.  He bats at a mosquito,
grunts... turns over.

ANGLE UNDER GUARD BARRACKS

MOVING with Rambo as he crawls among the support posts.

He freezes as a light is snapped on above him.
It streams down through cracks between floorboards.

Moving very slowly, Rambo squints through a gap.

RAMBO'S POV

A LOW ANGLE on a UNIFORMED GUARD rummaging in a tiny
prehistoric refrigerator, humming to himself.

He takes out a can of COKE, recognizable, although the
label is in Chinese characters.  Rolls it slowly across
his sweaty forehead.  Pops it.  The foam now runs onto the
floor, drips into Rambo's eyes.

The light snaps off.  FOOTSTEPS.  Rambo moves on.


EXT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS

There are two rows of rusted iron bunks set out like a
hospital ward.  Most of them are empty.  Seven aren't.

SEVEN AMERICAN PRISONERS OF WAR

Like the man in the cage they are gaunt, scabrous.
Dressed in ragged peasant clothes too small for them.

One man, bathed in sweat, moans and tosses with malarial
fever.  Another is wrapped so tightly in a fetal position
his face is between his knees.

They have padded the bare springs of their cots with
mattresses of rubber leaves.

Rambo stands a few feet from them as if giving a
benediction, the crossbow raised in one hand.  He moves
on, leaving no trace.


EXT.  GUARD TOWER

The GUARD reclines in a folding chair, nodding to the beat
of unheard music.  A SONY WALKMAN is clipped on his belt
and he has the earphones over his GRAY PEAKED CAP.
He takes a last drag and tosses a cigarette over the
parapet.


EXT.  PERIMETER - RAIN FOREST

TIGHT ON BREWER hugging the ground as the smoldering butt
lands five feet from him... in the pool of light from a
floodlight.  He groans, watching the smoke curl up.

Starts creeping his hand toward the butt.


EXT.  COMPOUND - CAGE

The man inside opens his eyes when Rambo touches his
broomstick neck, feeling for a pulse.

His lips are parched and there is a horrible bruise around
one eye.

				PRISONER
			(barely audible)
		Who're you?

				RAMBO
		American.  Come to get you out.

				PRISONER
		Man, you are one scary-looking
		motherfucker!

				RAMBO
		Can you walk?

				PRISONER
		I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna
		be... stiff.

Rambo quickly picks the lock on the wrist clamps and then
slips his LILE KNIFE from its sheath.
Starts cutting the lashings on the bamboo cage.

				RAMBO
		What's your name?

				PRISONER
		De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio.
		Lieutenant... Air Force.

The door gives way and Rambo steadies De Fravio as he
slumps forward.

				RAMBO
			(shakes his hand)
		Good to meet you, Dave.  I'm Rambo.
		Okay, I'm going to carry you.  Don't
		cough or make any noise.

				DE FRAVIO
		Sure thing, Rambo.  You gettin' the
		other guys, too?

				RAMBO
		Not this time.  We'll be back.

Rambo slings De Fravio's gaunt six-foot frame over his
shoulder in a fireman's carry and heads off in a crouching
run.

LONG SHOT ON RAMBO

crossing a pool of light B.G. as the sentry lounges in
his shack.


EXT.  PERIMETER - RAIN FOREST

Brewer seems to have lost sight of Rambo.  He scans the
camp to the treeline and back.
The filterless cigarette is smoked almost to his lips.

WHAM!  A BOOTED FOOT SMASHES DOWN on his rifle, pinning
one hand.  He looks up at...

A NORTH VIETNAMESE GUARD who holds an AK-47 in Brewer's
face.

With his headphones on Brewer hadn't heard the quiet
approach from behind.

Brewer closes his eyes in profound misery.
There is a soft THUNK.

Brewer opens his eyes as the AK-47 falls into the grass.
Looks up to see...

The guard is leaning back against a tree, motionless.
The VANED TAIL of a CROSSBOW BOLT protrudes from his neck
under the jaw.  He is pinned to the tree, quite dead.

Rambo appears from the undergrowth, still carrying De
Fravio, crossbow in hand.

				RAMBO
			(to Brewer)
		That's two.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Brewer and Rambo, carrying the POW, rejoin Co on the
ridge, where they had left their gear.

Rambo sets De Fravio down and reaches for his boots.
The POW looks dazedly at his rescuers.

His eyes, in hollow sockets, track from one to the other.

				DE FRAVIO
			(weakly)
		You guys are real... aren't you?

				BREWER
		Huh?

				DE FRAVIO
		Sorry, I mean... I talk to people
		all the time... I know a lot of them
		aren't there.  But this is real,
		isn't it?  You're taking me home
		now?

				BREWER
		That's right, buddy.

De Fravio sits frozen for a moment, then a dry sob wracks
his entire body and he puts his arms around Brewer.
He cries with utter abandon, quietly, while Brewer looks
at him helplessly.

				DE FRAVIO
		Thank God... thank you...

Brewer looks at Rambo with a stricken expression.  Then
puts his arms clumsily around De Fravio, like somebody
holding a baby for the first time.

Co touches Rambo's hand.  Motions "let's go" with a cock
of her head.  He nods.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR PRISON CAMP - LATER

A stocky SERGEANT OF THE GUARD stands over the partially
concealed body of the guard Rambo killed.

He raises his whistle and sends a SHRILL BLAST across the
camp.
Lights come on in the guard barracks.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - RIVER BANK - NIGHT

The sampan waits beyond a screen of trees as Brewer calls
in on the TRANSAT.  Co is helping De Fravio walk
unsteadily down to the boat, B.G. The river bandits eye
the tall, death-like figure suspiciously.

				RAMBO
		We'd better go for the emergency LZ
		at point Zulu Sierra.  Tell them
		we've got some heat but don't

Brewer starts typing.

INT.  SAMPAN - CA RIVER - NIGHT

De Fravio seems a little more in focus as he sits huddled
with the others in the cramped cabin.

				DE FRAVIO
		I gotta tell you, it's just luck you
		guys came when you did.  They move
		us around a lot... We only been at
		that camp a week.  Got a smoke?

				BREWER
			(pointedly)
		No.

				DE FRAVIO
		What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you
		call this?

				RAMBO
		Why were you in the box?

				DE FRAVIO
		Well, I caught this cobra, see...

				BREWER
		You mean the snake?

				DE FRAVIO
		Yeah.  It's not hard once you get
		the hang of it.  In the wrist.
		Anyway, I did what I always do when
		I get one...

				BREWER
		What's that?

				DE FRAVIO
			(straight-faced)
		Put it in the guard's barracks.
			(pause)
		Man they got pissed.  They beat the
		crap out of me, but... it's kind of
		a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run
		around.

				RAMBO
			(chuckling)
		You got a bad attitude.

De Fravio grins, showing bad teeth as well.

				DE FRAVIO
		I know it.

De Fravio eyes Co as she hands him a plate of rice and
meat.

				DE FRAVIO
		Thanks lady.  You're pretty cute...
		doing anything this weekend?

				CO
			(smiling)
		Eat slowly.  Don't make yourself
		sick.

She exits with the dirty cooking utensils.


EXT.  SAMPAN

When Co closes the door to the cabin, Kinh sidles up to
her and rapidly whispers something in Vietnamese.
He seems to be eliciting a response and eyes her warily.

Co freezes indecisively, then nods yes.

In the stern, B.G., one of Kinh's men is talking quietly
on a beat-up military-style FIELD RADIO.
His voice is masked by the sound of the outboard motor.

Co whispers something and holds out her hand, palm up.
Kinh grins, gaptoothed.  He pulls a .45 PISTOL from his
belt and slips it to her.  Runs his finger along the curve
of her neck.  She quietly pulls the cocking slide,
chambering a round.


EXT.  CA RIVER - INLET

The sampan glides into the brackish estuary amid half-
submerged trees.  It is the original rendezvous point.

Everyone assembles on deck, with Rambo helping De Fravio
through the cabin door.
Brewer checks his watch.

				BREWER
		Twenty-five minutes.  We'd better
		roll.

Rambo freezes... looks down.
An AK-47 muzzle is pressed into his kidney, held by one of
Kinh's men.
Two more are covering Brewer, who had just handed his
rifle to Co, while donning his pack.

Kinh steps up, grinning.  Takes Rambo's rifle.  A fourth
guard eases an arm around his neck, a long knife held
under his jawline.

It has all happened smoothly and with precision planning.

				KINH
		Wa-ky number ten.  Do-ma.

				DE FRAVIO
		Yeah, fuck your mama-san, too.  In
		the...

Kinh backhands him to the deck.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

his eyes cold, looking at Co.

She advances on him.  Her black almond-shaped eyes
glitter, alien as the depths of space.

She spits in his face.
Kinh snorts a feral laugh.
Rambo doesn't react.

E.C.U. CO

Her eyes dart to the side.

RAMBO AND CO

something, a microsecond flash of understanding, passes
between them.

				BREWER
			(enraged beyond
			 belief)
		You slope bitch!

She whirls on him, drawing the .45.  It is enormous in her
child's hand.  Her expression is terrifying.

SHE FIRES

The renegade behind Brewer ROCKETS BACKWARD, his FACE
EXPLODING.

Rambo moves, slapping his guard's elbow, driving the knife
across and away.  His teeth snap shut on the man's
forearm.  The knife falls.

Rambo's hands are simultaneously seizing the other guard's
AK-47 just as he fires.  Rambo holds his hand on the man's
trigger hand, AIMING THE GUN.

BULLETS RAKE FROM GROIN TO FACE on the third man standing
opposite them.
HE SPINS BACK, his rifle BLASTING AWAY harmlessly into the
sky.

Co places the muzzle of the .45 against Kinh's temple.
His grin is long gone.
SHE FIRES WITHOUT HESITATION.

Rambo drives the butt of the second man's AK-47 into his
stomach twice.  The bandit lets go.

Firing blind over his shoulder, Rambo vaporizes the head
of his guard, whose hand he still grips viciously in his
teeth.  He releases the hand.  Almost like spitting out
the dead man.

Clutching his stomach, the last bandit leaps to the shore.
FIFTEEN ROUNDS FROM BREWER'S SILENCED MAC-11 stutter
quietly into him.  He pitches face-down in the mud.

A cloud of blue cordite smoke disappears in silence.
The whole thing lasted four seconds.

				DE FRAVIO
			(slowly)
		Wow!

				BREWER
		What just happened?

Rambo moves over to Co.
She seems to sag, depleted.  In shock.
He takes the .45 from her limp fingers.

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Are you okay?

				CO
			(answering in
			 English)
		Yes.  But I lose many merits in next
		life.  Very bad.

				RAMBO
		Why'd they want us?

				CO
		They heard about escaped prisoner on
		radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.

				BREWER
		They sold us out?  Now I'm pissed.

				CO
		They were fools.  To think there
		would be reward.  And to ask my
		help.

Rambo puts his hands on her shoulders.

				RAMBO
		Thanks.

				CO
		Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh
		say meet them here.  Whole garrison
		from Con Cuong is out.

				RAMBO
			(nodding grimly)
		Let's go.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - LAOS - NIGHT

At treetop level the all-black UH-60 ROARS down a forested
valley at 180 mph, using no illumination but the moon.

MOVING WITH THE HELICOPTER

as it rises and drops with the terrain.


INT.  UH-60

Once again Doyle is night-flying in a blacked-out cockpit,
putting the landing skids through the treetops.

Trautman stands behind the seats in the main bay.

Night air ROARS in the open door and Lifer, on door gun,
dangles his legs in the windstream.  The rain forest is a
dim blur very close below.

				LIFER
			(shouting)
		Back in Indian country.  Just like
		old times.

He racks the bolt on his M-60 and grins.
Trautman nods politely and looks at his watch.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR WAT - PRE-DAWN

Rambo's group circles the ruins as they head for the
landing zone.

The trail skirts an escarpment which drops over a hundred
feet to the Ca River below.  Not far from the overgrown
spires of the Wat is a stream which breaks over the cliff
in a graceful waterfall dropping unimpeded into a lagoon.
The vista is quite stunning in the moonlight.

Brewer is struggling with both packs plus the heavy
Transat, since Rambo has De Fravio and Co has her own
pack.  Brewer scrambles, slipping back on the steep trail.

				BREWER
		Let's ditch this Transat.  We don't
		need it.

Rambo considers for a moment, then pulls away some
underbrush beside a collapsed wall of the ruin.

				RAMBO
		Bury it here.  Work fast.

Brewer gets out his entrenching tool.

A cold pre-dawn light suffuses the rain forest, giving it
an expectant quality.
Rambo scans the ridgeline with Brewer's scope.

RAMBO'S POV - TELEPHOTO

Figures of TWENTY OR MORE VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS can be seen
threading among the trees.

				RAMBO
			(to Co)
		You better take off.

				BREWER
		Ain't you coming with us, sweet
		thing?

				CO
		My orders stay here.

She turns to head off along a diverging trail.  Rambo
touches her shoulder.  She turns.

				RAMBO
		See you in California.

Her grin is ironic.

				CO
		Land of big PX.  Maybe I take you
		for a ride in my Cadillac.

Rambo watches her go.  A tiny, anonymous peasant girl.


INT./ EXT.  UH-60 - DAWN

Trautman watches over Doyle's shoulder as the helicopter
roars between the walls of a mountain pass.  The ship is
buffeted by turbulence, bouncing and dropping violently.

				FUHRMAN
			(turning)
		Three minutes.

The steep slopes fall away and Doyle dives the ship across
the rolling foothills.

We HEAR a faint call, barely audible over static.

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Zen Hammer this is Slam Dunk One, do
		you copy?  Over.

				FUHRMAN
		Roger, Slam Dunk One... what is your
		position?


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR PADDIES - DAWN

Rambo is crouched with Brewer and De Fravio in a hollow
beside an earth dike.

They are taking AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE from the trees
nearby.
Spurts of earth leap up around them.

Rambo is shouting in a controlled articulate voice into a
small PRC-90 FIELD RADIO while Brewer lays down
SUPPRESSING FIRE with his M-16 A2.

				RAMBO
			(yelling)
		Zen Hammer... the heat's on.  We're
		taking fire.  Watch for my smoke.
		Red and green.  Northwest corner of
		a big paddy.
			(to Brewer)
		Let's move.

Rambo and Brewer, carrying De Fravio, charge up and over
the dike as the ground is ripped around them.

Rambo hurls two SMOKE GRENADES down the dike wall.
Columns of red and green smoke begin roiling upward.

The dike on which they are pinned down forms part of the
enclosure for a complex of terraced RICE PADDIES which
occupy the few flat acres of this hilly terrain.  The
flooded fields reflect the pre-dawn sky like plates of
burnished metal.

Rambo slams in another clip and fires in short, controlled
burst.  Brewer hands a captured AK-47 to De Fravio.
The ex-POW opens up with a vengeance.

				BREWER
		Go for it, man.  Good therapy.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEARBY

VARIOUS ANGLES as THREE TROOP TRUCKS slide to a halt on a
rutted jungle road, disgorging squads of NVA TROOPS.

Mortars are set up.  Roughly aimed.  THEY FIRE with a
CHARACTERISTIC WHUMP.

ON THE DIKE

The Americans duck as a mortar round explodes in the paddy
behind them, throwing up a geyser of mud.  Brewer picks up
the PRC-90 mike.

				BREWER
			(on radio)
		You guys comin' or what?


INT.  UH-60

Through the front canopy distant wisps of red and green
smoke can be seen.  The paddies rush by below in a blur.

				FUHRMAN
		Roger... we have you on visual.  We
		are coming in.  How many are you?

				BREWER (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Three.  We got an American POW with
		us.

				TRAUTMAN
		Relay to command.  They have one of
		ours.


INT.  COMMAND SHACK - THAILAND

Kirkhill is pacing behind the main console.

				TELECOM TECH
		Mr.  Kirkhill... I have an AWACS
		relay.  Zen Hammer reports the
		ground team has an American POW with
		them.

Kirkhill's reaction is unexpected.  He whips around.

				KIRKHILL
		What did you say?

				TELECOM TECH
			(grinning)
		They've got one of ours.

TIGHT ON KIRKHILL

as a look of frustrated rage is replaced by deadly calm.

				KIRKHILL
			(loudly)
		This station is now on Condition
		Bravo.  Harrison.  Meyers.  Goodell.
		Out... now!

The puzzled techs drop their headsets and leave.

				KIRKHILL
			(continuing to tech)
		Go to your COMINT priority
		frequency.  Give me the mike... Zen
		Hammer, this is Coach One.  This is
		an Alpha-Kilo-Victor command
		priority.

				FUHRMAN (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Roger, Coach One... go ahead.

				KIRKHILL
		I want you to abort the operation
		immediately.


INT.  UH-60

Fuhrman can't believe it.

				FUHRMAN
		Say again, Coach One?

He presses the helmet-headphone tight to his ear, then
turns to Trautman, cupping his hand over the mike.

				FUHRMAN
			(to Trautman)
		He wants us to abort before pick-up.

				TRAUTMAN
		Confirm it.

				FUHRMAN
		It is confirmed.
			(to mike)
		Coach One... we have them in
		sight...
			(pause)
		Yes, sir.

Doyle looks at both of them and shrugs.

				DOYLE
		Turnin' around.

				FUHRMAN
			(to Doyle)
		I thought you liked those guys.

				DOYLE
		I do.  But they ain't payin' the
		rent, Jack.

				TRAUTMAN
		Stay on your heading, Captain.

				DOYLE
		Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.

				TRAUTMAN
		That's an order.

				DOYLE
			(implacable)
		Sorry, Sir.

Trautman has his hand on the butt of his .45 when he hears
the clack of a rifle bolt over the rotor noise and turns.

Lifer has an M-16 in his lap, not exactly aimed at the
colonel, but not aimed away, either.

				LIFER
			(smirking)
		We ain't Uncle Sam's misguided
		children no more, Colonel.  We're
		independent contractors.

				FUHRMAN
		That's right, Sir.  We don't like
		this, but we are working for Mr.
		Kirkhill.

				TRAUTMAN
		You pathetic scum.

				DOYLE
			(looking down)
		Well, if there weren't POWs before,
		there are now.


EXT.  RICE PADDY

Rambo half-supports De Fravio with one arm and fires his
AK with the other as they slog through the calf-deep
water.  Mortar rounds explode on all sides.  They watch
the UH-60 skimming in low across the paddies, blasting up
a curtain of spray.

Almost to them...

It veers in a tight bank and climbs out.

Heads away.

				BREWER
		Where's he going?
			(to radio)
		Hey, Zen Hammer, where are you
		going?
			(pause)
		Do you read, Zen Hammer?  Over.  Son
		of a bitch!  They're ditching us!

The water is shot into spray around them.  A mortar shell
lands so close it knocks them down, drenching them with
slimy black mud.  The radio disappears in the water.
Rising, Brewer takes a round in the thigh.  Drops.
Disappears for a second... comes up gasping.

Rambo watches the UH-60 diminishing to a black dot.
He is so consumed with rage that his expression goes
slack... blank... a murderous disconnection from
conscience.
And yet, in that same moment, a tremendous surge of blind
will clears his mind, a determination to survive, to get
out at whatever cost... to find whoever did this.

It is no longer just a mission.  It is a very personal
piece of business.

He turns and lets his rifle drop into the water.  He takes
De Fravio's and throws it away.

				BREWER
			(through gritted
			 teeth)
		The fuckers left us, man... they
		left us.

Brewer wallows weakly, his blood streaming out into the
muddy water.

De Fravio looks stunned, lost... eviscerated.
He sags to his knees.

				DE FRAVIO
		Oh... God.

It gets quiet.
In a ragged line, the NVA soldiers advance to the top of
the dike.  Twenty.  Forty.  Finally almost eighty, looking
down at the Americans.  Rambo slowly raises his hands.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - HILL NEARBY

OVER THE SHOULDER of Co, watching from behind a screen of
foliage as the ring of NVA troops converge on the tiny
figures of Rambo, Brewer and De Fravio.

REVERSE

TIGHT ON CO, her expression enigmatic.  She turns and
darts away, vanishing into the forest.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  KIRKHILL'S TRAILER

Kirkhill is pouring scotch over ice in two glasses as the
door behind him bangs open.

Trautman's expression could slice a steak.

				KIRKHILL
		Have a drink.

Kirkhill offers a glass to Trautman who ignores it.

				TRAUTMAN
		Why?

Kirkhill sets the glass down and sits at the dinette,
motioning Trautman to sit as well.

				KIRKHILL
			(shrugs)
		You got five hours?  I'll tell you
		about Secretaries of State, and
		funding committees and diplomatic
		relations...

Trautman slowly sits opposite him, his demeanor becoming
more reasonable.

				TRAUTMAN
		Take your time.

				KIRKHILL
		Look, Colonel... we're all adults
		here.  This is a war.  A very quiet,
		very intense war.  People get
		sacrificed.

				TRAUTMAN
		Not my people.

Kirkhill freezes, glancing down.
The muzzle of Trautman's service .45 is jammed into his
groin.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		But you're right... some people do
		get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you
		pulled the plug.

				KIRKHILL
		You think I'm some whacko?  I like
		to hurt people?  I'm doing a job
		here.  If I knew what's right or
		wrong I'd be a goddamned priest,
		right?  So I follow directives... I
		do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If
		your boy had done what he was told,
		there wouldn't be a problem.

				TRAUTMAN
		Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be
		walking funny.

Trautman leans on the .45 a bit and Kirkhill backs into
the seat cushion.

				KIRKHILL
		Look, it was a screw-up, alright?
		They weren't supposed to find
		anything.  We thought that camp was
		empty.

				TRAUTMAN
		This mission was a scam from the
		word go?

				KIRKHILL
		Word came down... they wanted an
		answer.  And they knew the answer
		they wanted: no POWs.  But it had
		to look good.  Best effort.  The
		whole dog-and-pony show.

Kirkhill takes a healthy pull from his scotch.

				TRAUTMAN
			(realizing)
		Rambo and Brewer were selected as
		write-offs.

				KIRKHILL
		It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo
		was a decorated Vietnam vet, a
		former POW himself... if he came out
		and said "No POWs" the sub-committee
		would buy it.  He gets himself
		caught he's a private citizen, a
		whacko, acting on his own.  If he
		gets proof, it gets lost somewhere
		between here and D.C.  Airtight.
		But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero.
		Thinks he's starring in his own war
		movie or something.  He put me in a
		corner.  No choice.

				TRAUTMAN
		"Terminate with extreme prejudice."

				KIRKHILL
		That's a crock.  We don't say that.
		Do you have any idea the shitstorm
		if he'd gotten back with that guy?
		If it went public?  The White House
		would have to act through channels.
		We're talking ransom.  Four billion
		bucks in war reparations to Vietnam
		to get the others back.  That's
		billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For
		a few guys that've had their brains
		in a blender for ten years?  A pain
		in the ass to everybody?  No way.
		There's no way.

The colonel has let the pistol drop, until it is dangling,
forgotten.

				TRAUTMAN
		So there never was a Phase Two
		rescue team?

				KIRKHILL
		Of course not.  You can't get
		approval to rescue a kitten from a
		tree after Tehran.

After a long silence, Trautman nods.

				TRAUTMAN
		I understand.

Kirkhill relaxes.  It's going to be okay.  The colonel is
one of the boys.

				KIRKHILL
		Here.  Drink.

Trautman doesn't take the glass.

				TRAUTMAN
			(reasonably)
		I understand your position.
			(pause)
		I understand how a maggot like you
		can just slide out of a jam on a
		trail of slime.  And call it --
		expedience.
			(viciously)
		Expedience!

Kirkhill slams his empty glass down.  His tone becomes
self-righteous.

				KIRKHILL
		You're out of your depth, Trautman.
		Way out.  I'm acting correctly here.
		Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle
		ace.
			(pause)
		It's over.  Walk away.

				TRAUTMAN
		It's not over.  You made one
		mistake.

				KIRKHILL
		What that?

Trautman clicks the safety and reholsters the .45.

				TRAUTMAN
		Rambo.


EXT.  PRISON CAMP - VIETNAM - DAY

		D-PLUS 36 HRS
		BAN KIA NA
		REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM

TIGHT ON RAMBO

his eyes ablaze, face crusted with dried mud and sweat.

WIDER

revealing him under guard, arms bound painfully tight
behind him, in the back of a troop truck.

He is seized by TWO VIET SOLDIERS and dragged forward, off
the truck.
De Fravio hits the ground behind him, and Brewer, moaning
on a stretcher, is unloaded.  His fatigues are matted to
the skin by dried blood from hip to knee.

Camp commander CAPTAIN VO QUOC VINH strides across the
compound.  He is fairly twitching with suppressed rage at
the loss of face brought on by his useless guards.

He screams orders as the troops dismount, roughly dragging
forward the three captives.

A VIET SERGEANT turns the captives over to CHIEF GUARD
SERGEANT TRAN VAN TAY with a quick salute.

The instant Vinh stops shouting Tay begins, like a relay.
The prisoners are prodded forward.

Rambo walks beside a wide-eyed Brewer.

				BREWER
		Are they going to torture us?

				RAMBO
			(distantly)
		Yes.

				BREWER
		What... whattaya do?

A GUARD shoves Rambo on ahead as Brewer's carriers stop at
the door of an isolation cell.

				RAMBO
			(looking back)
		Hope they kill you by mistake.

Rambo's guard slams his rifle butt into the American's
belly, half-doubling him over.

				GUARD
		No talk!


INT.  ISOLATION CELL

The door to a tiny fetid room is opened and Brewer is
dumped off the stretcher and flung inside.  He lands on
his knees and gasps in pain, clutching his leg.

The door clangs shut, leaving stifling gloom.

				BREWER
			(groaning)
		This ain't happening.


INT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS

De Fravio is helped back to his bunk by one of the other
prisoners.  There are few moments in human experience as
devastating as the return to prison (especially this
prison).  The absolute abandonment of hope.

Several of the POWs sit near him, silently offering their
support.  It is evident that two of the men, B.G., are as
autistic as De Fravio, having succumbed to that withdrawn
plane long before.

JENSEN, a prisoner with one leg, settles beside De Fravio
on his bunk.  Puts a spidery hand on his shoulder.

				JENSEN
		We were pulling for you, Dave.  We
		hoped you'd make it.

De Fravio's eyes focus.  The merest spark of the old
defiant De Fravio glimmers wanly.

				DE FRAVIO
		Next time.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - DUSK

LOW ANGLE on Sgt. Tay, powerful and vicious-looking as a
rabid ferret.  He raises one fist, holding a LENGTH OF
RUBBER STRAP cut from a truck tire, and smashes it down
OUT OF FRAME.

There is a SICKENING THUD against flesh.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

grimacing from the blow.
There are board red welts over both collarbones, oozing
blood in places.

WIDER

showing Rambo on his knees, at the center of a bare
CONCRETE ROOM.  A single window admits a shaft of red
dusk-light, like a spotlight.
Rambo sways in the spotlight, glistening with sweat,
stripped to his G.I. shorts.
In the four corners of the small room are guards with
rifles.  Others crowd in the doorway, grinning and
jostling to see.

WHAM!  The truncheon descends against Rambo's face.
He sprawls onto the floor face-down, nose streaming blood.

Capt. Vinh enters with a strident shout, stopping Tay
from another blow.  The two officers exit at a run,
leaving Rambo on his face before the guards.


EXT.  CAMP COMPOUND - DUSK

An unearthly wind and the THUNDER of several helicopter
rotors fills the camp.
Two American-made "HUEY" HELICOPTERS descend to lumpy
landings near the guard towers.

One is a UH-1D "Slick" troop carrier and the other is a
UH-1B Gunship outfitted with a pedestal-mounted MINIGUN
and M-60 door gun.
Captured from the ARVN in 1975, both ships bear the
insignia of the Republic of Vietnam.

Beyond the guard tower, and dwarfing the two Hueys, an
ENORMOUS HELICOPTER ROARS out of the setting sun.
RUNNING LIGHTS and STROBES FLASH as the massive silhouette
drops into the courtyard raising a blast of dust.

It is a SOVIET MIL MI-24 assault helicopter.

Its double blister canopies look like huge insect eyes.
The STUBWING WEAPONS PODS bristle with rockets and
cannons.
It is painted with jungle camouflage and bears the red
star insignia of the SOVIET NAVAL AIR WING.

The Viet officers and guards cringe against the rotor
blast as the ship settles.  The side door slides open.

DOLLY BACK, PRECEDING TWO RUSSIAN OFFICERS who tower above
the Vietnamese as they stride across the camp.

Vinh points to the concrete blockhouse and the officers
stride past him without slowing.  He falls in behind them,
trying to keep up.


INT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS

Jensen turns from the window as the MIL MI-24's jet-whine
fades.

				JENSEN
		It's those Russian interrogators
		again.

Everyone looks grim.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Vinh sends the gawking guards scurrying with strident
yells as he follows the two Russians into the room.  The
Soviets stand in front of Rambo.  The shorter of the two,
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER YATI PODOVSK, has the slight build
and unremarkable features of a bank clerk, though for a
man in his forties he is in superb condition.  The other,
LIEUTENANT PALYUSHIN, is another story.  He is a tall
broad slab of combat muscle, his black hair cut short as a
scrub brush.  Thick and functional as state sculpture, his
features cannot fill his broad, flat face.

Both wear the khaki field dress and black beret of the
Naval Spetznatz Brigada, The "Special Operations Brigada".

At Palyushin's feet, Rambo finds himself looking up at his
Soviet opposite number, the BLACK BERET.

				PODOVSK
			(in Russian)
		Put him in the chair.

Palyushin hauls Rambo onto a wooden stool against the
wall.  Podovsk sits next to him on a small metal desk.

It is almost dark and the only light is from a single bare
bulb.

				PODOVSK
			(Viet to Vinh)
		Thank you, Captain Vinh.  Leave one
		guard, please.

Vinh exits with Tay and the other three Viets.

Podovsk adjusts his wire-rim glasses and considers Rambo.
He turns Rambo's bloodied face gently, examining the
injuries.

				PODOVSK
		These people are so... vulgar in
		their approach.  I am Lieutenant
		Commander Podovsk.  I do not know
		who you are.  Will you tell me?

Podovsk's English is lightly accented but clear and
articulate.  He has a nasal condition, however.  Rambo
doesn't answer.

				PODOVSK
			(continuing)
		No?  Not even your name?
			(silence)
		This is a poor beginning for an
		intimate relationship.  By tomorrow
		or the next day you will tell me
		things you would not tell a lover.

Podovsk notices the long criss-crossed scars on Rambo's
chest and back.

				PODOVSK
			(continuing)
		I see you are no stranger to pain.
		Then of course you must know how
		senseless it is to resist in the
		long run.  Is it possible you have
		been among my Vietnamese comrades
		before?

Podovsk catches something as Rambo breaks his gaze,
looking away.

				PODOVSK
			(continuing)
		Yes.  I think that must be it.
		Where were you held?  Hanoi?  Son
		Tay?  I apologize.  I'm getting
		ahead.  Sometimes I get too eager.
		My comrade and I, in our capacity as
		advisors, have been sent from our
		center at Cam Ranh Bay to discover
		from you certain things... for
		example: whether you are working
		directly for the American
		government... Who your contacts
		were... and on and on.  Quite a
		list.  Will you tell me these things
		now?

Rambo gazes at a point in space.

				PODOVSK
			(continuing)
		Of course you won't.  But, as a
		moral man, I felt compelled to ask.

He stands with a shrug of finality and gestures to his
massive assistant.

				PODOVSK
		This is Lieutenant Palyushin.  To
		him you are a piece of meat.
			(in Russian to
			 Palyushin)
		Proceed.

LOW ANGLE

on Palyushin walking forward.


EXT.  CAMP - MAIN GATE - NIGHT

The guard in the sentry box glances up from a newspaper at
the SOUND of an approaching MOTORBIKE.  A YOUNG WOMAN
wearing an ao-dai and coolie hat rides up on a HONDA
SCOOTER and stops by the shack.

OVER THE GIRL'S SHOULDER

as she steps up to the guards box and coos something to
the sentry.  He grins to see a new face among the whores
from the village, and one so pretty... great luck.

REVERSE ON GIRL

revealing that she is Co, as she dickers price through the
sentry box window.  He unlatches the gate.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

An IRON BED FRAME has been brought in and leaned
vertically against the wall opposite the door.

Rambo has been tied to the frame spread-eagle by lengths
of COAT HANGER WIRE around his ankles, neck and forearms
at the elbows.

Palyushin is setting up a box-like PIECE OF EQUIPMENT on
the small desk.  There are wires running from the bedframe
and from a METAL PLATE about the size of a paperback book
taped to Rambo's belly.

Palyushin clamps the other ends of the cables to terminal
posts on the box, which has a large RHEOSTAT knob and
several switches and dials.

				PODOVSK
		I was sent here because of my
		command of your language.  It will
		be frustrating if we cannot have a
		nice chat.  Very frustrating.
			(Russian to
			 Palyushin)
		Ready?

Palyushin nods and douses Rambo with a BUCKET OF WATER.

				PODOVSK
			(Russian)
		Test please.

Palyushin, without ceremony, twists the knob.

Rambo convulses with an explosive muscle contraction.
Slams against the springs.  His veins swell as if to
burst.


EXT.  CAMP COURTYARD

The lights of the camp dim, flickering, under the current
load.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Rambo slams convulsively against the electric grid formed
by the steel bed.  His teeth are clenched as if he has
tetanus.


INT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS

The lights come up to normal brightness.
De Fravio closes his eyes, sharing a ghost of the pain.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Rambo hangs from his bonds, heaving and shivering.

Podovsk turns to him conversationally, as if he were an
acquaintance at work rather than a man being tortured.

				PODOVSK
		Oh, yes.  Here is something you
		might be interested in.

He draws a folded piece of paper from his pocket.  Opens
it.

				PODOVSK
		A transcript of the conversation
		between your helicopter pilot and
		his commander, intercepted and
		unscrambled by our overworked
		cryptography staff.
			(reading)
		Mmm.  "Zen Hammer... Slam Dunk."
		Colorful names.  Here we are: "Ah,
		Coach One... we have them in sight."
		And the reply: "Abort immediately.
		Return to base camp."

He graciously shows Rambo the printout.

				PODOVSK
		It seems they intentionally
		abandoned you on direct orders.
		There are the people you protect
		with your silence?  With your pain?

He snaps his fingers and Palyushin cranks the knob.
The lights dim.

Rambo fights the scream unleashed within him with every
fiber of his being.  Straining like a demon, every muscle
sharply defined and rock hard.

				PODOVSK
			(almost kindly)
		But you must scream.  You must.
		There is no shame.

It bursts out, a roar that frays his vocal cords.


EXT.  CAMP COURTYARD

Co, moving stealthily in the shadow of a wall, pauses at
the SOUND of the scream.  Notes its direction.


INT.  ISOLATION CELL

In the darkness Brewer rages against the inhuman
screaming, pounding the wall.

				BREWER
		Bastards!


INT.  INTERROGATION CELL

Rambo hangs so limply that he might be dead.  Podovsk
moves in to check as Rambo's head begins to rise.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

as he looks up.  His eyes seem like diamond drills.
There is such determination born of rage in his expression
that Podovsk stops.  Takes a step back.
Snaps his fingers.

Rambo convulses and begins to scream.  Podovsk nods to his
assistant.

INSERT - PALYUSHIN'S HAND

cuts off the current.  But the scream CONTINUES.  GETS
LOUDER.

BACK TO SCENE

The Lieutenant looks up, puzzled.
Rambo is going berserk.  His body is an out-of-control
machine, lashing and tearing at the frame.  The scream
breaks and becomes a FEROCIOUS HOWL.

The Viet guard steps forward, alarmed and unnerved.
His rifle is raised, warding off evil.

Podovsk motions him back and steps closer himself.
The bedframe begins to twist, creaking and warping under
Rambo's frenzied assault.

TIGHT CUTS - RAPID SUCCESSION

A weld.  Springs pop.
Podovsk takes a reflexive step forward.
Rambo's hand shoots out, free suddenly, like a grappling
hook.
Palyushin hits the CURRENT.
Rambo jerks Podovsk into a headlock, a death embrace.
Podovsk screams.  Convulses.

				PODOVSK
			(to Palyushin)
		Nyet!  Nyet!

The Russian lashes about, convulsing in the current.

The lieutenant cuts the power.

Rambo snatches Podovsk's MAKAROV PISTOL from his holster.
Aims it at his temple before Palyushin can reach for his.
The Black Beret eases his hand away from his holster.

ON THE GUARD

Frozen.  A FIGURE slips through the door behind him.  Co
cuts his throat in one motion with a BUSH KNIFE.

She covers Palyushin with the guard's AK-47 as she circles
to Rambo who is still enmeshed in metal wreckage.
Rambo smashes the Makarov into Podovsk's temple twice,
then holds Palyushin transfixed by his pistol sights as Co
works quickly at his bonds.  There are superficial cuts on
his forearms, ankles and neck from the wire.

Rambo SCREAMS hideously and with cold premeditation to
mask the sound of her work.  The effect is bizarre,
surreal, maniacal.

				CO
			(whispering)
		We get out.  Split up.  They not
		want me.

Rambo steps from the wreckage and advances on the hulking
Black Beret, pistol ready.

Again he screams, almost a war cry now, and smashes his
fist into the Russian's face with the force of his entire
body behind it.  The big man's head ricochets off the wall
into a second piledriver punch.
Palyushin goes down.

Podovsk groans and stirs until Rambo twists the knob.
Despite a bad connection, Podovsk jerks spasmodically
under the collapsed metal frame, lying in the puddle of
water.

Before Co can use the knife on Palyushin, Capt. Vinh
enters, his expression agape.  He turns and bolts.


INT.  CORRIDOR

Vinh dashes out, SHOUTING MANIACALLY.  Behind him Rambo
hurtles through the door, a blur, and smashes Vinh against
the concrete wall.

Vaulting over the crumpled camp commander without slowing,
Rambo hits the outside door at a full run.  Just as Sgt.
Tay is opening it from outside.


EXT.  COURTYARD

Tay's AK flies from his hands as he tumbles back.
Rambo spins into him with a FLYING ROUNDHOUSE KICK which
pitches him onto his back, an inert heap.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

The transformer box shorts out under the continuous load,
frying with a bright FLASH.
The lights of the camp go out completely.


EXT.  COURTYARD

With Co close behind him, Rambo runs toward the compound
fence.

A SHOUT FROM NEARBY.  A RUNNING GUARD and Co open up with
their assault rifles simultaneously.

The guard dives for cover.
Rambo lifts the wire for Co to wiggle under.  She
reciprocates for him as the TOWER GUARD spins his long-
unused PK MACHINE GUN and opens fire.
Co fires from the shoulder.
The tower guard flinches at the unexpected return fire.
Dives.  His shots go wild.  Co's AK empties.  She drops
it.

Rambo and Co make it into the forest, running full out.
MORE AKs OPEN UP behind them.  Both TOWER PKs.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

HANDHELD PRECEDING RAMBO at a dead run as he crashes
through foliage.  The forest is an insane blur.
TRACERS WHIP BY, ruler-straight lines of red light...
deadly fireflies.

BARK EXPLODES from tree trunks around them.  Leaves are
ripped into green confetti.

They angle away from the blind firing.  Stop at a GAME
TRAIL.

				RAMBO
			(panting)
		You are amazing.

Co is furious at his dawdling.

				CO
			(pointing down trail)
		Di di mau!  Go!  Go!

She spins and sprints away along the trail, disappearing
in a moment.  Rambo hesitates an instant, then runs the
other way.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Palyushin, his nose and mouth streaming blood, claws his
way up the desk and reels across the dark room to Podovsk.
He hurls the metal frame off his superior, who groans
feebly.


EXT.  COURTYARD

A guard holds Sgt. Tay's shoulders as he retches.
Palyushin strides out of the interrogation blockhouse and
jerks the sergeant to his feet by his collar.  He points
to the forest.

				PALYUSHIN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Find!  Now!

He releases the Viet sergeant and briskly walks toward the
MIL MI-24.  Tay weakly calls orders B.G., rounding up his
guards.

The RUSSIAN PILOT is waiting dutifully near his machine as
Palyushin approaches.  The Black Beret makes a circular
hand signal... WIND HER UP.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Rambo at a dead run zig-zags along the dark game trail.

The path steepens and he claws at exposed roots...
climbing as much as running.  Behind him is the rising
sound of rotors.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR CAMP

Using HAND LIGHTS to follow his footprints, Tay's SQUAD OF
SIX GUARDS jogs into the jungle.  Behind them, through the
trees, the massive assault helicopter and its escort of
Hueys rise into the night.

The three choppers switch on their HIGH INTENSITY
SEARCHLIGHTS as they thunder overhead.
Shafts of light pierce the jungle.  Sweeping.  Searching.


EXT.  FOREST

Rambo is climbing rapidly, using roots as handholds to
ascend the steep trail.

The WHUMP-WHUMP of the helicopters approaches, the glare
of light flickering behind him.
Rambo moves into a densely woven thicket.  Freezes,
watching.  Moves on.


EXT.  FOREST - NEARBY

The guards are ascending the trail like hounds.


EXT.  FOREST - TRAIL

Rambo crashes through foliage as a SEARCHLIGHT SWEEPS
TOWARD HIM.
It races over him, backlighting him as he dives off the
trail.
The searchlight flicks past him.  Snaps back.

TRACERS rip down through the trees.
RED SLASHES OF DEATH.
Rambo tumbles, rolls, comes up running.  He tears through
the jungle in a frenzy.
The foliage is alive with blasting air.

He dives over the edge of a muddy ravine, dropping through
tangled vines.  Catching, clawing, dropping.
He runs on.
Totally manic.
They can't target him.

He hits a solid trail and sprints, really covering ground.
The shaft of light scans back and forth behind him.
Then farther away.  They've lost him.  For the moment.

ANGLE ABOVE JUNGLE CANOPY

as the choppers circle, seemingly dueling with lances of
light.


EXT.  TRAIL - NEARBY

Rambo, moving rapidly, but more carefully, glides among
the trees.  He stops at the BANK OF A TINY STREAM, setting
down knife and pistol.  Scooping stinking BLACK MUD from
the stream bed, he begins to slather it over his pale skin
with quick, sure strokes.  Arms.  Legs.  Body...

TIGHT ON RAMBO'S FACE

eyes closed, as he smears the goo thoroughly over every
exposed area.  His eyes open.  It is a neolithic, feral
visage that turns away into the foliage.

ON THE GUARDS

moving forward cautiously.  Unfamiliar with tracking, and
little else really except bullying weak prisoners, they
crash around clumsily, falling and cursing in the dense
thicket.

CLOSE ON RAMBO

moving in absolute silence nearby.  He freezes.
Fifteen meters away is a SMALL WILD PIG, asleep under a
knot of vines.  Rambo fires the makarov, hitting the earth
near the pig.  It squeals and leaps up.

THE GUARDS

wave their AKs, looking for the source of the shot.  They
hear something crashing through the undergrowth to the
right.  Movement in dense brush.  They open fire.

The CRASH OF SUSTAINED FIRE is deafening.  They blast
blindly away, lighting up the forest.
Their attention is so focused, the din so loud, they do
not notice a dark figure moving up behind them.

Rambo snatches the wayward last guard into a thicket,
knife buried to the hilt, hand over his mouth.

Tay shouts repeatedly to cease firing and the others
finally stop.

They move away, advancing on their "target."
Tay gingerly parts woven branches, revealing the pig,
riddled with hundreds of 7.62mm rounds.  He turns to the
others.

				TAY
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Where's Trang?

The other guards look around, puzzled.

ON RAMBO

A shadow in shadows.  He slips the clip from the AK-47 he
has liberated, but finds it almost empty.  Sets it down
quietly.
Tay spreads his men out to sweep the area in an arc.
The guards advance, stricken with a growing unease.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

LOW ANGLE through the trees as the Soviet assault
helicopter passes overhead, its searchlight sweeping.
The canopy of foliage lashes violently as the rotor wash
blasts through it.  Monkeys SHRIEK and leap about.

ON RAMBO - FOREGROUND

as the godlike shaft of light moves through the brush
behind him.  Searching.  Passing within a meter of him.
He moves quickly off.

The disk of hideously bright light passes over two guards,
blinding them.  One trips and goes down.  The other, the
outermost man of the sweep, waits for him to rise.  And
waits.

				GUARD
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Vuoc?  You alright?

The guard moves cautiously to his friend's last position.
Ahead face-down in a shallow stream, is the BODY OF VUOC,
his blood running away with the water.

Approaching the body warily, the guard plays his
flashlight around him in a full circle.  Nothing.

DETAIL ON MUDBANK

Featureless matted vines and mud.  Suddenly A PAIR OF EYES
SNAP OPEN.

ON THE GUARD

kneeling over Vuoc in the F.G. Behind him there is silent
movement among the gnarled roots and vines in a muddy
embankment.
Blending flawlessly with the mudbank, Rambo's mud-
encrusted figure has been in PLAIN VIEW, YET CONCEALED,
until he opened his eyes and moved.  He emerges
noiselessly and moves up behind the guard, looming above
him.


INT./ EXT.  MIL MI-24

Palyushin mans the forward cockpit, the WEAPONS BAY.
His hands clutch the handles of a machine gun as he scans
the jungle below.  The pilot directs the searchlight as he
flies.

Palyushin touches his nose gingerly.  It is clearly
broken, becoming a thickened, purplish mass.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Realizing they are without their flankers, the two CENTER
GUARDS call out and move toward their last positions.
They stand together at the top of the mudbank, gaping at
the two bodies sprawled below.

ANGLE ON TAY

isolated, calling for his men to sound off.  He hears a
distant shout, then a quick burst of gunfire.

				TAY
		Bui?  Phong?  Than?

There is no answer.


INT.  MIL MI-24

Palyushin points at something on the ground.
The pilot banks, arcing around his searchlight's target.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Tay moves forward hypnotically, as if transfixed.

The celestial shaft of the searchlight burns down ahead.
He approaches.  Like a vision he sees the BODIES OF HIS
MEN sprawled in the quivering disk of light.  One has been
stripped of his clothing.  He stares around, terrified,
staggers back, lip quivering.

Tay drops his rifle and runs back through the jungle.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - RIDGE

Rambo climbs steadily.  The mud, dissolving in sweat, runs
in streaks off his body.  He has stopped to slip on the
FATIGUE PANTS he took from one of the guards.  The pants
come to mid-calf but the material will protect against
brambles and insects.

He has also acquired an AK-47 with EXTRA MAGAZINES.
His pockets bulge with SOVIET-MADE GRENADES.

Rambo moves on into the mountains.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - DIRT ROAD

Tay stumbles out of the underbrush into a pool of light.
The headlight of a VIET ARMY TROOP TRANSPORT.

A squad of men runs past him into the jungle, fanning out.
Another truck arrives.
The search is on in force.


INT./ EXT.  FLIGHT CENTER - NAKON PHANOM AFB - DAWN

An F-4 PHANTOM JET taxis amid MOVING GROUND EQUIPMENT
under the floodlights as the sky slowly lightens.

		D-PLUS 53 HRS
		NAKON PHANOM, THAILAND

PAN OFF THE FLIGHTLINE onto Trautman gazing out the window
of a small office.  He looks haggard.  Soul-weary.
With the receiver cradled at his ear he is waiting for a
call to connect.

				TRAUTMAN
		Bob, hi.  Did you get my telex?
			(pause)
		Yeah, I know what time it is
		there... do you know what time it is
		here?  Look, is there anything you
		can do up the line?  You owe me one.
		I'm calling it in.
			(pause)
		Yes, this time.
			(pause)
		I know you're a general and I'm only
		a colonel.
			(long pause)
		So that's it, huh?  Back off.  Come
		home... that's it?
			(pause, then frostily)
		Thanks, buddy.

He slams the receiver into its cradle, and sits,
pondering.  He is about to make a somewhat bizarre
decision for a full colonel.

Trautman opens the door and the young corporal in the
office beyond turns in his chair.

				TRAUTMAN
		Get me a "Loach," I'm going back out
		to Ban Bung Kla.

				CORPORAL
		Yes, sir.


INT.  ISOLATION CELL

BLACK SCREEN.  There is a SCRAPING SOUND and light appears
as a CEMENT BLOCK is removed at floor level.  De Fravio's
face appears in the rectangular hole.

				DE FRAVIO
			(whispering)
		Hey, Brewer.  You okay?

Brewer crawls stiffly to the opening, squinting at the
glare.

				BREWER
			(hoarsely)
		I could use a beer.


EXT.  GUARD BARRACKS - CELL

The cement-block wall of the cells adjoins the raised
wooden barracks.  De Fravio and Jensen have belly-crawled
beneath the building to the cell, where they have long
used a loosened block to communicate with prisoners in
"the hole."

				DE FRAVIO
		Your buddy made it out last night.
		The place went apeshit.

				BREWER
		Really?  How come he didn't take me?

				DE FRAVIO
		Maybe because you're shot in the
		leg.

				BREWER
		Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they
		keep you in this disease hole?

				JENSEN
		Who knows?  I was in there for a
		month once.  De Fravio did three
		months.

				BREWER
		How do you keep from coming unglued?

				JENSEN
		Concentrate on a problem.  Like, I
		built my dream house in my head,
		brick by brick.  Board by board.  If
		something really takes a day, I
		thought about it for a whole day.
		Like that.

				DE FRAVIO
		I built a shopping mall.

				JENSEN
			(urgently)
		Guards.  See ya.

They slide the block into place and Brewer sits in front
of it, COUGHING TO HIDE THE SCRAPE as the door is opened
by two guards.

Morning light blasts in, blinding him, as one guard hauls
him roughly to his feet, despite his wounded leg.

				BREWER
			(menacingly)
		Watch it.  Don't fuck with me, man!
			(jerks a thumb at
			 himself)
		I'm dinky dau!

The guards guffaw and drag him off.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - MORNING

A line of Viet soldiers moves through the shimmering
jungle.

CAMERA BOOMS UP

as they move past, revealing others beyond, and the tops
of parked trucks.
The MOVE ENDS ON RAMBO, watching from the branches of a
tree as they move by only a few meters below.  The
choppers search methodically nearby.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Brewer is trussed tightly, his elbows tied together and
drawn up painfully by a cord attached to a ceiling
fixture.
Palyushin looms in front of him, holding the truck-tire
bludgeon.

Podovsk, looking the worse for wear with a bandage
covering half his face, sits on the stool.  The gaze of
his exposed eye is malevolent.

				PODOVSK
			(wearily)
		I think you know where he is going.
		Is there a rendezvous point?  Some
		guerrilla contract?  A transmitter
		perhaps.

				BREWER
			(earnestly)
		No way.  If I say anything... that's
		three.

The interrogator scowls, briefly perplexed.

				PODOVSK
			(rising)
		I cannot be responsible for the
		safety of the prisoners if he is not
		captured.  This government now
		considers the existence of POWs an
		embarrassment.  An unmarked grave in
		the jungle may be their solution.  I
		am only an advisor.

				BREWER
		Advise my dick, you Siberian
		scumbag.

Palyushin explodes with a brutal blow to Brewer's ribs,
which doubles him over in agony.  He struggles to regain
his breath, dragging at the air like a terminal emphysema
patient.  Brewer slowly raises his head.

				BREWER
			(sneering)
		Ke-rist.  Whattaya trying to do,
		man, tickle me?

Palyushin snarls and smashes the truncheon down even
harder.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - DAY

Rambo runs crouching along a shallow gully, trying to duck
around the end of the advancing line of Viet troops.
He emerges from dense foliage onto a DIRT-TRACK SIDEROAD
only to see a FLANKING SQUAD of about ten men jogging
toward him.  They shout and hit the deck, opening fire, as
he dives on into the underbrush.

Rambo runs, zig-zagging radically as small-arms fire laces
the woods around him.  He crashes through foliage,
abandoning stealth.

LONG LENS WHIP-PANNING with Rambo as he charges down a
long slope, the trees a green blur.  He crosses his arms
over his face and batters through the brush with blind
force.


EXT.  HOOTCH

Rambo bursts out of the dense tangle, dragging streamers
of vines, and finds himself in an EXPLOSION OF SQUAWKING
CHICKENS.

He is in the muddy door-yard of a rural HOOTCH, part of a
SMALL HAMLET, of about a dozen buildings.
Pigs scatter, grunting their surprise, as Rambo sprints
across the yard.  Over a low rail fence.  Between the
hootches.

Soldiers charge down the slope behind him.


EXT.  HAMLET

Rambo emerges onto the main "street" at a dead run,
tearing a swath through the everyday village activities.

The Viet peasants scatter as the fierce American charges
through their midst.  A giant by their standards to begin
with, Rambo is now a mud-caked nightmare, trailing vines
and brambles... his face a mask of dark streaks topped by
encrusted hair.

He crashes into a panic-stricken young man on a bicycle,
spilling them both.  Rolls.  Comes up running.

Rambo changes course to intersect with an ANCIENT TRUCK
which is accelerating away, headed out of the village.
The truck, rusted and mud-caked into a brownish lump on
wheels, is hauling a load of CHICKENS in a WIRE MESH CAGE
on the flat bed.

Rambo leaps onto the running board of the cab and points
his pistol through the window at the terrified OLD MAN
driving.

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Keep driving.


EXT.  ROAD

Rambo clings tightly as the truck rattles and bounces over
the rutted road, which shortly emerges from a stand of
trees to run along a field of ELEPHANT GRASS.

Rambo sees soldiers converging on the road through the
trees on the other side.  Behind him, more emerge from the
village and open fire.

A bullet shatters the filthy windshield and the old driver
loses control.  The truck veers into a ditch, slews,
hurling up a sheet of water and flops ignominiously on its
side.

Rambo lands clear.  The old man begins to sob helplessly.
The chickens scatter in all directions.

CLOSE ON RAMBO, freeing a RUSTED GAS CAN from the twisted
wreck of the truck bed.

WIDE from behind the soldiers as they pour AK-47 bursts
into the truck 50 meters away.  A figure dashes from the
now-burning vehicle into the field of tall grass,
disappearing.


EXT.  ROAD - EDGE OF GRASS

Two troop trucks are deploying soldiers as a group of
OFFICERS stands near the chicken truck.  Sgt. Tay climbs
down from a six-by cab.  Directing operations is Capt.
Vinh.  His face is bruised and abraded, and one arm is on
a sling.

Vinh motions Tay impatiently toward where he stands at the
edge of the elephant grass, and Tay wades into it, joining
him.  Beyond them the coarse grass becomes an impenetrable
wall almost EIGHT FEET HIGH.

Vinh snorts in disgust at Tay and points at some trampled
stalks.  There is a bright smear of blood, and beyond,
another.  Vinh cuffs his sergeant.

				VINH
			(Viet/subtitled)
		You see?  Not a demon.  A man.  Now,
		we find where he's crawled to die.

Tay indicates that the others should go ahead of him, to
have that honor.

A line of THIRTY REGULARS moves into the grass.  Only the
RADIO ANTENNAS of the squad leaders are visible above the
waving stalks.  The helicopters arc in from the distant
ridgeline, converging.


EXT.  ELEPHANT GRASS

POV, HANDHELD, MOVING SLOWLY THROUGH THE GRASS.  The point
man parts the stalks ahead.  It is a quiet, eerie world,
with only the SWISH OF THE GRASS and the occasional SOUND-
OFF CALLS of the troopers.  There is a clear trail of
blood smeared on the grass, indicating a serious wound.

VARIOUS CLOSEUPS of the regulars as they advance, each man
realizing how utterly isolated he really is, in his own
island of space in the green sea.  It is hot.  Some of the
soldiers have their fatigues unbuttoned, sleeves rolled
up.  Sweat pours off them.

POV, HANDHELD, following the trail of blood.  The grass is
parted ahead and a small clearing comes into view.
Slowly moving up on SOMETHING LYING IN THE GRASS.
TWO CHICKENS, THEIR THROATS CUT, are lying beside the gas
can, which is upright with its cap off.  A bizarre little
shrine.  There is no sign of Rambo.

REVERSE on the squad leader, puzzled, wary.

INSERT - RAMBO'S HAND strikes a match, igniting a wet
trail of SPILLED GAS with a WHOOSH.

The squad leader looks up, seeing the river of fire
snaking toward him through the waving stalks.

He turns, panicked.  Crashes into the men behind him.

Shrieks at them to move.  They trample over each other to
run as the trail of fire reaches the can.

VOOM!

Tay sees a tremendous fireball erupt ahead.  Hears
SCREAMING.  He freezes in his tracks as the nightmare
begins again.  Shrieking, a man runs toward him, ON FIRE,
charging past.

Vinh shouts futilely into a radio.  Firing blindly,
several troopers open up.


EXT.  ROAD

From the trucks it is apparent that the grass is burning
on its own, in a long line where the "fuse" was laid out
and in a widening circle around the explosion site.


EXT.  IN THE GRASS

Black smoke rolls through the grass, and troopers stumble
about, coughing as the wind carries it toward them.

The choppers have moved in close overhead and their rotor-
wash fans the fire, adding to the confusion.

FAST HANDHELD PRECEDING RAMBO

as he snakes rapidly through the stalks.  He stops.  Hurls
a grenade.  Runs on, navigating by instinct in the dense
smoke.

VINH

is knocked down as a grenade detonates near him.

A trooper helps him up, sees a figure running nearby...
fires.  Hitting one of their own.
More grenades.  Random firing.  The din is incredible, the
pandemonium absolute.

A VIET SOLDIER, reels through the grass.  Obviously a
recent conscript, the soldier is probably only 18 years
old, and like all Vietnamese, looks even younger.  He is
terrified.

He stumbles over the body of another trooper.  As he
rises, a shape slashes through the grass right in front of
him.
He has never seen an American, but it looks as monstrous
as the descriptions.

He raises his AK but Rambo is quicker, kicking it out of
his hands.  The kid flops on his butt and finds himself
staring up Rambo's rifle barrel.  He closes his eyes and
pops into his mouth his BUDDHIST PRAYER MEDALLION, hanging
from a chain around his neck.  He bites down and waits for
oblivion.

When he opens his eyes there is nothing in front of him
but grass.

Nearby, Vinh leads the retreat as his men fall back, dim
shapes rushing blindly through the murk.
He staggers, coughing, out of the stand of grass to see
Tay, sitting dazed nearby.  Tay gives him an evil smirk.

Barking orders like a maniac, Vinh calls for MORTARS to be
set up.  Five mortars are positioned.  Elevation set.
Mortar bombs poised above the launch tubes.  The
helicopters clear off.

When the last wounded man is dragged clear, Vinh signals
for a sighting round.
It EXPLODES beyond the wall of flame.  The mortars open
fire.

The field explodes seconds later with the first salvo.
Earth and shredded grass are hurled skyward.  A second
salvo lands.  A third.  And on and on, pulverizing the
entire area.


EXT.  TREELINE - NEARBY

Rambo watches, fascinated by the tremendous destruction
unleashed on innocent acreage nearby.

He slips slowly into the woods, glancing back frequently
at his trail.  He stops occasionally to replace a
disturbed twig or leaf, or to rearrange branches when he
passes through.  Total "sterilization."
The mortars thud on distantly as he creeps away.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

FULL SHOT as Palyushin delivers a crippling blow to
Brewer's ribs.  Brewer cries out hoarsely and slumps.

CLOSE ON BREWER as his head slowly rises to look at the
big Russian.

				BREWER
			(panting)
		This your first day?

Podovsk catches his assistant's hand before he swings.

				PODOVSK
		You think you can provoke us into
		beating you unconscious?  We are not
		that... unskilled.

				BREWER
		I've had it with you, ratface.
		Don't piss me off!

Podovsk takes the "fan belt" from Palyushin and smashes it
across Brewer's face.  Again.  Brewer scream hideously.
And again.

CLOSE ON BREWER

We see only the top of his head.  We don't want him to
rise up, but he does, agonizingly.  Blood streams over the
area where his eye is already swelling shut.
Don't say anything, Brewer.

				BREWER
			(hoarsely)
		Aaargh.  God damn that... was...
		good!
			(shouting)
		Do it again, you fuck!
			(screaming)
		Come on... I love it!  You hear
		me... I LOVE IT!

Podovsk looms before us, swinging in slow motion, INTO THE
LENS.  The scene FADES OUT.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - DAY

Under overcast sky Rambo emerges at a steep-walled ravine.
There is a swaying SUSPENSION BRIDGE of rope and woven
vines crossing to the jungled slope beyond.

Looming at the top of that slope is the ruin of the Wat on
its plateau, wreathed in streamers of blowing mist.

Not far away is the waterfall, pouring itself into the
gorge below.

Rambo stops at the far side of the bridge, examining the
vine-cables.
He starts pulling grenades out of his pockets.


EXT.  PRISON CAMP - DAY

Palyushin crosses the compound to the Huey gunship which
has just touched down.  The other Huey hovers above the
trees B.G.

The big Russian appreciatively pats the MINIGUN bolted in
the main door as he climbs in.
Palyushin enters the cockpit, motioning for the VIETNAMESE
PILOT to take off as he slips a headset over his black
beret.
The ship rises, and the two Hueys bank across the jungle.


INT.  MOTC - THAILAND

		D-PLUS 58 HRS

The telecom tech turns as Kirkhill enters.

				TECH
			(handing him a sheaf
			 of papers)
		More AWACS intercepts.  The Russian
		takes time to translate.

Kirkhill scans a long PRINTOUT TRANSCRIPT.

				KIRKHILL
		He's giving them a run for their
		money.  Says here they've got two
		Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know
		those dinks had Hueys.

				TECH
		Half their air force is our stuff.
		Captured.

				KIRKHILL
		Typical...

				TECH
		Sir, there's something else... a
		TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.

				KIRKHILL
		What?

He snatches the sheet from the tech.

E.C.U. - PRINTOUT SHEET

It reads:

		KIRKHILL/I'M COMING FOR YOU/RAMBO

KIRKHILL

stares at the sheet for a long time.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR WAT - DAY

Rambo finishes dismantling the TRANSAT unit.  He sets the
pieces back into the hole of the CACHE he and Brewer
buried before their run through the jungle.

He begins shoveling earth back into the hole.
A beautiful PURPLE MOTH-ORCHID drops onto the ground by
his hand.  He freezes.

				VOICE
		You not so hard to catch, dinky dau
		Rambo.

Rambo looks up along the tumbled stone wall.  Sitting near
the top in shadow, perched on a tree limb, is Co, beaming
like a Cheshire cat.

				RAMBO
			(relaxing)
		Christ.  How'd you get here?

				CO
			(climbing down)
		Took bus, most of way.  I knew you
		would come here.

He helps her down the last few feet, and stands looking at
her, marveling.

				RAMBO
		And how'd you sneak up like that?

				CO
		Carefully.  Don't want to get shot
		by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you
		need me.

				RAMBO
		I do?

				CO
		You think you are... (she uses a
		Viet word).

				RAMBO
			(translating)
		Invulnerable.

				CO
		In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass
		kicked without me.

Rambo has to laugh.

				RAMBO
		Yeah.  We're a pretty good team.

Co looks him over carefully.  She touches his forehead.

				CO
		You look like hell.  Wounds
		infected.  Come up to the ruins, I
		have medical kit.

Rambo lets her lead him to the path up the hill.


EXT.  RUINS OF WAT

The stone Buddhas look on complacently as Co attends to
Rambo's minor wounds.  During the ensuing conversation she
cleans, applies salve and bandages the wire-lacerations
and the numerous slashes from brambles and saw-edged
elephant grass.

				CO
		You try get across Laos?  Get to
		Thailand?

				RAMBO
			(nodding)
		Yeah.  Got some business there.
		What are you gonna do?

				CO
			(shrugs)
		Go United States.  See Nguyen.
		Maybe teach economics.  Buy
		Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."

				RAMBO
		How you going to get there?  You
		can't trust the spooks to pull you
		out.  They'll use you up and throw
		you away.

				CO
		I know.  I go with you.

				RAMBO
		I couldn't get you in.

Co stops her work and replies very quietly.

				CO
		Yes you can.

				RAMBO
		How?

Co's gaze holds his and her Cheshire grin flickers.

				CO
		As wife.

Rambo realizes she is serious.  The silence drags when he
realizes how good that sounds to him at this moment.  And
how small a price that is to repay her.

				RAMBO
			(with finality)
		Okay.  Done.  You got it.

She seems a bit shocked, then smiles impishly.

				CO
		You too easy.

Co's hands have been all over him but only now does he
become aware of them on his shoulders.

She draws her face up to his but Rambo pulls back from the
kiss.  Co looks puzzled as he slowly disengages from her
contact.

				CO
		You don't feel love, Rambo?

He leans back against the wall.

				RAMBO
		Look, Co...

				CO
		Why you don't feel love?  Not
		allowed?
			(her tone becomes
			 aggressive)
		Dead inside, maybe?  You make
		yourself dead already so they can't
		kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!

She advances on him until her face is close to his, her
words finding their mark.

				CO
			(continuing)
		Bucu bullshit!
			(pause)
		I have enough death already.
		Husband.  Mother.  Father.
		Brothers.  Death everywhere.

She points into the undergrowth nearby, to a ghostly
blossom growing there among the tangled vines.

				CO
		You see?  A flower like that need
		good soil to grow.  Many time under
		earth is bones of animal... or
		person.  Killed in jungle.  Make
		soil rich.  Grows most beautiful
		flower.  You call orchid.  Many
		deaths in jungle.  Vietnamese, V.C.,
		American.  Many beautiful flowers.

Rambo studies her intently.  An emotional moment for him.
He takes her flawless face in his hands, draws her closer.

Suddenly his head snaps around.  A distant THUDDING of
COPTER ROTORS becomes audible, growing slowly louder.

Rambo leaps up, sprinting to a crumbled parapet.
Below, in the valley, the two Hueys are slowly scanning,
like angry insects.


EXT.  SUSPENSION BRIDGE

A COLUMN of VIET SOLDIERS jogs across the swaying bridge.

ANGLE PAST AN OBJECT IN F.G.

as the lead man approaches, almost across the bridge.  The
object is a CLUSTER OF GRENADES lashed to a tree to which
one of the main support cables of the bridge is attached.

A FINE WIRE runs down to the bridge walkway.

PING.  The wire pulls a pin.


EXT.  WAT RUINS

Rambo whips around as an explosion rips through the
jungle.


EXT.  BRIDGE

The bridge begins to collapse, dumping half the soldiers
into the ravine as one side drops.  The others run back.
The second cable tears away.  The bridge swings down,
spilling the remaining men.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - TREETOP LEVEL

The two Hueys bank steeply and ROAR straight TOWARD
CAMERA, passing overhead.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR WAT

Rambo and Co head into a trail which leads down the
backside of the plateau.  Rushing toward them is a PLATOON
of VIET REGULARS.

Rambo opens fire, scattering them off the trail.
He and Co make it back to the Wat as return fire rips
through the jungle.

Rambo throws two grenades down the hill and sprints with
Co deeper into the maze of the ruined monastery.

The soldiers fall back as the grenades detonate ahead of
them.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin speaks into his helmet radio.

				PALYUSHIN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Get your men back.  I'm beginning an
		attack run.

The Huey THUNDERS toward the ruins, banking in an arc to
aim the "minigun."


EXT.  RUINS

Rambo sees the Huey coming in on a high arcing trajectory
and knows he's in trouble.  Dragging Co, he dives under a
section of wall which has collapsed like a lean-to.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin's thumb depresses the FIRE CONTROL SWITCH.

An AWESOME ROAR fills the sky.  A COLUMN OF ORANGE FIRE
blasts from the minigun as its gatling-gun barrels rotate
in a blur.

One of the most ferocious anti-personnel weapons used in
the Vietnam war, the GENERAL ELECTRIC M-134 Minigun fires
six thousand 7.62mm rounds per minute.  Since every fifth
round is a tracer, the impression is of a solid shaft of
fire sustained between ship to ground.

The SOUND is not that of a machine gun but rather a SOLID
HELD NOTE OF THUNDER, like a god belching.
One of its nicknames was "Puff the Magic Dragon."


EXT.  RUINS

The effect on the ground is unbelievable.  Trees are blown
to kindling.  The foliage is pulverized, and blown upward
like mist.

The tracers hit the ground like an orange curtain
stripping the stones of growth, blasting up a cloud of
emulsified jungle.

In their crevice, Rambo and Co huddle, covering their
ears.
A fusillade of chips and splinters whips around them.

Suddenly, the thunder cuts off.

Rambo rolls out.  Fires well-aimed bursts at the
retreating Huey.


INT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin hears rounds whacking the underside of the ship.
He calmly orders the pilot to turn back.


EXT.  RUINS - CREVICE

Rambo crouches in the opening, watching the ship bank.

				CO
			(terrified)
		What was that?

				RAMBO
		Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move.
		He's coming in on our open side.

They sprint across the courtyard as the minigun ROARS
again.  The CURTAIN OF DEVASTATION sweeps toward them as
they run.  They make it behind one of the Buddhas, just as
the hail of death passes across it.
The rounds blast a layer of weathered stone off the serene
face.

Behind Rambo the second Huey pops above the trees, firing
with a conventional door gun, an M-60.
Rambo fires back.
Tracers flash around him.  He reloads.  FIRES.

CO CRIES OUT.  She is SLAMMED AGAINST THE WALL.
The second Huey banks away.  Rambo crouches beside Co's
crumpled figure.


INT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin turns to the pilot.

				PALYUSHIN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Return to staging area.  We have to
		reload.


EXT.  RUINS

Rambo cradles Co, whose blouse is drenched with blood.
It runs over his hands as he holds her helplessly.

She is as white as the jungle orchid.  Her eyes focus
slowly on Rambo.

				CO
			(almost inaudible)
		Dinky-dau-Rambo.

Rambo is rocking her, willing the life to stay in her, his
expression anguished.

				RAMBO
		John.  My name is John.

				CO
			(very weak)
		It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it
		hurt?


INT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin coordinates the air operation.

				PALYUSHIN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Air Two, circle in a holding
		pattern.
			(Russian/subtitled)
		Air Three, are you in position?


INT./ EXT.  MIL MI-24

In the spacious MAIN COCKPIT which overlooks the lower
WEAPONS BAY blister, PODOVSK is seated with the Russian
pilot.

				PILOT
			(Russian/subtitled)
		Ready, Air Command.

				PALYUSHIN (V.O.)
			(Russian/subtitled)
		Begin your run.

The pilot turns to Podovsk.

				PILOT
			(Russian/subtitled)
		How many are down there?

				PODOVSK
			(distantly)
		One.

The pilot looks at him strangely.  The massive assault
helicopter noses down and thunders forward across the
jungle.


EXT.  RUINS

VERY CLOSE ON RAMBO, rocking gently.

				RAMBO
		... you're gonna love it there.
		It'll be great.  We can do what we
		want... you and me... go to the
		beach... with Nguyen... watch him
		ridin' his surfboard...

Co's eyes are glazed, half-open.  She is gone.

Rambo sobs.  Somehow this one tragedy renders all the
others pale.

				RAMBO
			(continuing)
		Oh, God...

He kisses her mouth fiercely.  Trying to make her live, to
infuse her cooling flesh with some of his vast will.


INT.  MIL MI-24

				PILOT
			(Russian/subtitled)
		500 meters.  Final approach.


EXT.  RUINS

Rambo lays Co with infinite gentleness in the lap of the
stone Buddha.  In the lap is one slightly cupped hand,
palm upward, stripped of foliage by the minigun.
Co lies in the palm, barely filling it.

Single sniping rounds WHACK occasionally near Rambo.
He is oblivious.

Rambo removes the tiny BUDDHIST PRAYER MEDALLION from
around her neck and puts it on.  Straightens her clothing.
Looks up at the broad stone countenance.

Its expression is, as always, enigmatic.

He turns as the assault chopper approaches, running dead
at him.

TWO LONG METAL CYLINDERS detach from the stub wings and
drop, beginning their characteristic TUMBLING.

				RAMBO
			(awed)
		'Palm.

He spins and runs, leaving his rifle.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Rambo slashes through the trees like a madman, running
with everything he has.

Behind him the NAPALM CANISTERS hit the ground at the edge
of the ruins.

An ENORMOUS FIREBALL blossoms through the jungle.
The canisters' inertia carries them forward, SPEWING
TWENTY-METER-LONG ARCS OF FLAME.  The inferno engulfs the
Buddhas and rolls forward through the trees, silhouetting
the tiny running figure of Rambo.

Just as the firestorm reaches him he dives at a dead run
off an embankment.  Into a rushing MOUNTAIN STREAM about
five meters wide.

UNDERWATER SEQUENCE

Rambo dives to the bottom as a sun-bright CANOPY OF FIRE
rushes across the surface with a muffled ROAR.

The stream is only about two meters deep and is swiftly
flowing.  The napalm on the surface lights the bottom
orange despite the daylight.  He seems suspended in a
fiery maelstrom.

MOVING WITH RAMBO'S figure we dive at giddy speed over the
tortuous streambed like some weird amusement park ride.
Rambo tumbles over and between smooth boulders.

He strains to hold his breath as the fire diminishes
above.
Then it is gone.  He is clear.

Suddenly the rocks END, dropping away.


EXT.  RAVINE - WATERFALL

Rambo tumbles clear of the falling water as he drops down
the face of the CATARACT seen earlier.

He hits the surface of the pool with a tremendous SPLASH.

ANGLE ON WATER

boiling with turbulence as he surfaces, gasping.
He weakly sculls at the surface as the current carries him
along.

Above, on the escarpment, a FIRE-STORM rages, lighting up
the jungle.

The Buddha is at the heart of the holocaust, reminiscent
of a self-immolating monk.  Co's pyre is magnificent.


EXT.  BRACKISH ESTUARY

The pool at the base of the cataract empties into
swampland near the Ca River.
Rambo lets the increasingly torpid flow carry him until he
catches sight of a familiar object: The abandoned sampan
of the river bandits, still moored among the huge tree
roots.


EXT.  SWAMP - SAMPAN

Rambo clambers aboard and goes into the cabin.
Still in its wooden locker is the RPG-7 ROCKET GRENADE
LAUNCHER and a rack of ROCKETS in a carrying pack.
With rapid movements Rambo dons the pack and picks up the
launcher.  Moves to the stern.  Pulls hard on the starter
rope of the filthy outboard.

Across the estuary one of the Hueys is moving over the
trees, getting closer.  The motor starts on the third
pull.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY TWO

The VIET PILOT banks, motioning to his door gunner.  Below
them is the sampan, chugging across the estuary.

The pilot descends as the gunner opens fire.  The .30
caliber slugs riddle the sampan, sending splinters flying.

It EXPLODES, its incredible hoard of junk hurled flaming
into the swamp.

The Huey lowers farther, rotorwash whipping the water into
churning froth.

The Viets scan the debris, spotting a FLOATING BODY.

ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL

as the corpse rolls slowly over.  It is Kinh, the crazy
bandit leader.


EXT.  MARSH - NEARBY

WATER LEVEL.  The Huey, hovering 40 meters away, begins to
turn toward us.

SOMETHING RISES from the surface scum in CLOSE F.G. among
the gnarled tree roots.
A HULKING FIGURE dripping water and mud and strands of
swamp weed.

Rambo.

The launcher tube across his shoulder.

REVERSE - CLOSE ON RAMBO

as he wipes filthy water out of his eyes and returns to
the SCOPE-SIGHT, blinking, taking his time.

WIDER

The Huey's M-60 opens up, walking a parade of waterspouts
toward him across the water.

Rambo FIRES.
With a tremendous BACKBLAST the rocket leaps out, a fiery
arrow, and strikes the Huey square in the canopy.

FLASH!  CRACK!  The Huey drops into the swamp, its rotors
twisting up and flying off.  The FUEL TANKS EXPLODE.

Rambo pivots, reloading.  He takes aim and fires again.
The rocket roars into the rain forest, the blast sending
approaching soldiers scattering.

He reloads.  Fires again, flinching away from the rocket
exhaust.  His expression is grim, his movements
methodical.
He pivots again.  Fires.
Rounds start hitting around him.  He holds position.
Reloads.
Fires.

Beyond the trees, off the river road, the troop trucks are
parked.  Nearby is a REFUELING TRUCK for the helicopters.
Rambo's rocket makes a direct hit.
A FIREBALL BLASTS UP AND OUT, seeming to fill the jungle.


INT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin sees the smoke rising from the carnage ahead as
he returns with the minigun reloaded.
He motions the pilot to hover over the partially submerged
wreckage of the other Huey.


EXT.  SWAMP

WHIP PANNING with Rambo as he sprints along the horizontal
trunk of a fallen tree.
He vaults off the end.
Catches a skid of the hovering Huey with one hand.

Palyushin's door gunner swings his sling-mounted "free 60"
around to bear.  Too late.
Rambo's hand shoots up, catches him, pulls him out.


INT.  HUEY

The pilot feels the weight shift and looks back, seeing
Rambo on the skid.  He "pulls pitch" hard.
The Huey climbs, arcing radically.


EXT.  HUEY

Rambo slips, dangles.
He crashes through the upper branches of a tree as the
Huey climbs, banking in a tight arc.
The rain forest rolls beneath his dangling legs.
He heaves himself up.


INT.  HUEY

Palyushin lurches out of his seat.
He spins in time to see a filthy, bloody and very intense-
looking Rambo clambering in the gun door.

He rushes Rambo with a kick but Rambo ducks and swings the
M-60 door gun on its mount, blocking the Russian.
The two lock eyes and square off, crouching in the low
compartment.

The pilot turns around and gapes in amazement, allowing
the craft to sideslip.

Palyushin lunges as the Huey pitches wildly.
Rambo blocks in a sweeping SHAO-LIN CHUN ROUNDHOUSE,
ending in a fierce hammer punch to Palyushin's face.
They trade blows and blocks furiously, finally grappling
like wrestlers.

They crash together into the wall by the minigun AMMO
CANISTER.  The Huey yaws and recovers.  Open space roars
outside as they strain near the doors, trying desperately
to maintain footing on the pitching floor.

Palyushin goes half out the door but clings tenaciously,
surging back inside.
He hammers into Rambo, slamming him mercilessly back.
A vicious kick drops Rambo.  The Black Beret grabs his
hair and HURLS HIM TWO-HANDED TOWARD THE DOOR.

Rambo desperately catches the handles of the door gun,
stopping his plunge into space.  His weight swings the gun
around in its sling, pointing it into the ship.

Completely outside the helicopter, Rambo hangs from the
handle with one hand.  Pulls the bolt with the other.

And drills a long burst into Palyushin at point blank
range, blasting him out the far door in an explosive spray
of blood.

The pilot turns, terrified, as Rambo advances on him.
Rambo eases up beside him, slipping his hand onto the
COLLECTIVE STICK.

Reaching across he opens the pilot's door.  And FLINGS HIM
OUT!


EXT.  MARSH

A figure tumbles from the low-flying Huey and splashes
into the estuary.  The Huey dips and bucks, then rights
itself and flies off as the pilot surfaces, gasping.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  MOTC - THAILAND

Kirkhill looks like he hasn't slept in days as he stirs
his ten thousandth cup of machine coffee.

				KIRKHILL
		Well, have they got him yet?

The tech rereads the COMINT transcript.

				TECH
		Um... actually, no.  It looks like
		he shot down one of their

				KIRKHILL
		Christ almighty.

				TECH
		... and then he, uh... took the

				KIRKHILL
			(exploding)
		What?

Kirkhill sinks slowly into a chair.


EXT.  PRISON CAMP - VIETNAM - AFTERNOON

Sgt. Tay is sitting on the steps of the guard barracks,
looking a bit like a lost soul.
The sound of a rotor gets louder.

A shadow falls upon him.  He looks up squinting.

A shape, an outline... in the glare of the sun.
Tay has a moment of apprehension.
Then...


EXT.  RAMBO'S HUEY

Rambo unleashes the minigun.  The left guard tower
VANISHES IN A CLOUD OF FALLING SPLINTERS as thunder rolls
across the valley.

The Huey pivots nimbly.  The minigun roars again.
An orange lightning bolt vaporizes the right tower.

VARIOUS ANGLES IN CAMP

as the thunder fades.

Tay starts to run.
The prisoners dive for cover.

Three off-duty guards in the guards barracks go for their
rifles.
They don't make it.

FROM RAMBO'S POV

The guards barracks seems to disintegrate as the minigun
sweeps across it... a SHOCK WAVE OF DESTRUCTION behind
which only flying kindling remains.

He pivots a last time and annihilates the sentry post with
a one-second burst.  Three guards have managed to take
cover behind a truck by the main gate.  They begin firing.

LOW ANGLE ON THE HUEY, a roaring silhouette in the
metallic mist.  The minigun speaks.

The truck is ripped open like aluminum foil, shrapnel
flying.  The guards CEASE TO EXIST.

A spray of red mist and tattered scraps of uniforms
settles to the ground.

It is all over in seconds.

The Huey settles to earth in the center of the compound.
Tay, crouching, squints against the rotor blast.
Wild-eyed, Capt. Vinh steps from his partially collapsed
office and raises his side-arm pistol.

Tay snatches it from him with a terrified cry and an
expression which says: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

The Sgt. flings the pistol away and turns toward the
Huey.

Out of the boiling, blasting dust and smoke a FIGURE
EMERGES.

To Tay, Rambo is Death incarnate.

He is encrusted with dried mud, dried blood, streaked with
rivulets of sweat.  His eyes burn.

Rambo has detached the door gun from its sling and, with
the feed belt over one shoulder, carries it like a rifle.

He motions with the muzzle.  Tay and Vinh flop forward,
face to the earth, hands laced behind their heads.

Rambo moves past them, eyeing the wreckage of the camp
warily.


INT.  ISOLATION CELL

Darkness.
The door is kicked open and Rambo is there, silhouetted.

Brewer is a sorry mess, but alive.  He raises his head,
blinking.

				BREWER
		Gawd, you look awful.

				RAMBO
		You comin'?

				BREWER
			(trying to rise)
		Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a
		hand.

Rambo helps Brewer, who is nearly crippled with pain, to
his feet, and supports him as they exit.


EXT.  CAMP COURTYARD

The seven prisoners are helping one another into the
copter as Rambo and Brewer hobble up.

				RAMBO
		Can you handle the door gun?

				BREWER
		Duck soup.

Tay and Vinh are still face-down and De Fravio covers them
with an AK-47, found in the rubble.

Smoke swirls in the idling rotor wash as the barracks
begins to burn.

				DE FRAVIO
		Am I dreaming this?  This is not
		real, right?
			(to guards)
		I oughta grease you pricks, but I've
		known you too long.

				RAMBO
		Let's go, De Fravio.  Move it!

When De Fravio is aboard, crammed in with the others in
the main bay, Rambo remounts the M-60 and jumps into the
pilot's seat.

He brings up the RPMs.
The TURBINE WHINE INCREASES.

Brewer, crouched behind Rambo, yells forward.

				BREWER
		We got company.  You better pull
		some pitch, buddy.

Behind them, diving out of the sun's glare, is Podovsk's
massive assault helicopter.

Rambo pops the Huey off the ground and runs hard at the
treeline.

The MIL MI-24 NOSEGUN begins firing and the ground erupts
behind the Huey, fountains of earth chasing it as it
climbs out.

At full climb the laden Huey barely clears the trees and
Rambo Immediately banks tight to get out of the nosegun's
field of fire.

The Soviet chopper tightens its arc, but swings wide, and
Rambo spirals back.
Brewer swings the door gun and gets off a long burst as
the ground reels dizzyingly below and the horizon tilts.

				RAMBO
			(shouting)
		Brewer!  You know what that thing's
		packing?

				BREWER
		It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably
		has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking
		rockets and wire guided missiles,
		plus...

				RAMBO
		Forget it.

Rambo noses the Huey down, building speed.  Tail high, it
shoots across the treetops, its NOSE RADIO ANTENNA ripping
through the uppermost foliage.

THE SOVIET COPTER

rolls on its side in a tight turn, despite its bulk.

Twice the size and power of the Huey, and faster at the
top end, the high-performance assault ship is a formidable
opponent.  But Rambo pits skill against technology, using
the agility of his craft as his primary strategy.

ANGLE BACK

past the dodging Huey as the Soviet ship falls in behind,
steadily gaining.

PAST BREWER

who flinches as trees rush by seemingly inches away at 120
MPH.  The POWs are flung against the bulkheads as the Huey
plummets and swerves.

				DE FRAVIO
		I think I'm gonna be sick.


INT.  SOVIET COPTER - COCKPIT AND WEAPONS BAY

The pilot turns to Podovsk.

				PILOT
			(Russian/subtitled)
		They're approaching the border.
		Should we notify the Laotian Air
		Force?

				PODOVSK
			(driven)
		No.  We'll take them ourselves.

Inside the COMPUTERIZED WEAPONS BAY the GUNNER hunches
over his TRACKING SCREEN.  Rambo's Huey is a shimmering
blob weaving behind a targeting reticle.

The RANGING RADAR emits a rhythmic PINGING which INCREASES
in frequency.


EXT.  SOVIET COPTER

TWO AIR-TO-AIR ROCKETS flash from support pylons on the
stub wings and roar toward the Huey two hundred meters
ahead.

ANGLE ON HUEY

as the rockets skim past, missing only barely, to explode
in the jungle.

OVER RAMBO'S SHOULDER

through the front canopy, as the Huey flies through the
rising fireballs.

Rambo sees what he needs, a narrow river, a tributary of
the Ca, slicing through the rain forest.

The Soviet juggernaut is gaining as Rambo dives his
gunship "onto the deck," tearing down through an opening
in the trees and skimming over the surface of the river.
The Soviet craft can't follow.

The enormous trees form a canyon, the walls of which
overhang the river.  Rambo is actually zig-zagging beneath
the jungle canopy in places.  They flash in and out of
dense shadows.

The landing skids throw up spurts of muddy water as the
Huey banks.  Two more rockets arrow toward them.  One
explodes in a tree above.  The other flashes past.  Hits
the river ahead.  They fly through a wall of spray.

Brewer gives his REBEL YELL.

				BREWER
		Hell.  This is just like fucking
		Star Wars, man!

				DE FRAVIO
			(puzzled)
		Star Wars?

Brewer grins, realizing.  Slaps him on the shoulder.

				BREWER
		You're gonna love it.

				RAMBO
			(shouting)
		How much we got left in that
		minigun?

Brewer opens the enormous ammunition canister.

				BREWER
		Pretty low.  Couple of seconds
		worth.

Rambo is plugged into some insane second sight, knowing
the curves before they curve.  He flies with absolute
concentration.


INT.  SOVIET COCKPIT

The pilot is sweating, trying to stay on Rambo's Huey.

				PILOT
		We're in Laos, Sir.

				PODOVSK
		I know that!
			(to gunner)
		Fire all your rockets.  Take him
		down!


INT./ EXT.  HUEY

As the forest explodes around them.  The chopper is
buffeted.  The forward canopy is shattered by shrapnel.
Rambo is hit in the shoulder and chest.
His left arm broken above the elbow.
One of the prisoners is moaning, holding his bloody
forehead.

Rambo pulls up on the collective, sending blinding pain
through his arm.  The Huey shoots up out of the jungle,
spinning as it pops up.
It slips sideways through the air, seemingly going out of
control.
Then it arcs back, ROARING RIGHT AT THE CAMERA.


INT.  SOVIET COCKPIT

Podovsk watches Rambo's turn, realizing he has stood to
fight.

				PODOVSK
			(Russian/subtitled)
		We've got him.

The pilot stares apprehensively as the Huey comes at them.

In the weapons bay, the tone of the ranging-radar rises to
a shriek.  The gunner tenses to fire.


EXT.  HUEY

Rambo throws the gunship sideways and climbs in one
motion... bringing the minigun to bear.

He is a samurai and the Huey his sword.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

facing the Soviet leviathan, clear-eyed, in the Void Way,
as they say.
It will be a battle of one stroke.  He waits.  Feeling his
breathing.  Feeling the ship like an extension of himself.

ANGLE

The minigun BLAST FORTH ITS STREAM OF FIRE.

ON RAMBO

watching.  A shadow passes over him.

WIDE

as the Soviet ship thunders over them and flies on.

ANGLE

The barrels of the minigun continue to rotate, dry-
firing... empty.  Clicking like an air-ratchet.

ANGLE ON SOVIET COPTER

showing the riddled, glassless cockpit... the slumped
bodies.

WIDE

as the MIL MI-24 slowly brodies sideways and drops,
gracefully, into the rain forest.

It shears through trees, breaking up, and EXPLODES
GLORIOUSLY.


INT.  HUEY

Rambo is tensed, like a thousand volts are flowing through
him.  Slowly, he relaxes.  He knows they have made it.

				BREWER
			(exultant)
		The thrill of victory, the agony of
		defeat!

Rambo banks the Huey, ascending toward the mountain pass
and, beyond, Thailand.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  STAGING AREA - THAILAND - DAY

Lifer lounges in the gun door of the "Blackhawk" as the
ship sits at ready, turbine idling.

				TRAUTMAN (O.S.)
		Getting ready to go somewhere?

Lifer turns to see Trautman step around the fuselage of
the chopper.

				LIFER
		Hey, Colonel.  You're not cleared to
		be on this base anymore.

CLOSE ON TRAUTMAN

				TRAUTMAN
			(quietly)
		I know.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  LAOS - NEAR MEKONG RIVER - DUSK

		D-PLUS 60 HRS

The battered Huey lumbers and dips over the terrain,
barely in control.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY

Rambo seems drained of color, sunken into the seat, flying
on nerve.

Several of the prisoners are asleep.  The wounded man's
forehead has been bandaged.
Brewer is holding court.

				BREWER
		... and there's this guy with a
		black helmet and cape, right, and
		he's got this sword... except it's
		not a sword, it's light...

				DE FRAVIO
		There's the Mekong.

They look forward as a broad river appears beyond a ridge-
line less than a kilometer ahead.  The Thai border.  A
cheer goes up.  A home run.

ON RAMBO

seeing something as they approach the river.


EXT.  MEKONG - TREELINE

The BLACK SIKORSKY rises slowly above the trees directly
ahead.


INT.  HUEY

C.U. RAMBO, he blinks, trying to clear his vision which
has become light and shimmery.
The hovering ship looks like the Archangel of Death.
It seems like a vision.  He flies straight toward it.


INT.  MOTC

Kirkhill has cleared the operations center.  He is alone.

				KIRKHILL
			(to mike)
		When the unidentified helicopter has
		crossed the river into Thailand,
		shoot it down with air-to-air
		rockets.  Then proceed to the crash
		site and fire your remaining rockets
		into the wreckage.  Is this
		understood, Zen Hammer?

				DOYLE (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Ah, Sir... I'm experiencing a little
		hearing problem.

				KIRKHILL
		What are you talking about?  Why?

				DOYLE (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Well, uh... I've got something in my
		ear.


INT./ EXT.  SIKORSKY

What Doyle has in his ear is the muzzle of Colonel
Trautman's M-16.

Behind them on the deck of the gun bay Lifer is out cold.
A tarpaulin among a stack of ammo cases where Trautman
had been hidden is thrown back.  Doyle knows better than
to mess with him.

Trautman switches off the radio as Kirkhill shouts
incoherently.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY

As he approaches the black Sikorsky Rambo sees Trautman
with a rifle to Doyle's head.
He nods as they pass.


INT./ EXT.  SIKORSKY

Rambo's Huey passes by them, crossing into Thailand.

				TRAUTMAN
		Escort them on in.


EXT.  MOTC

Rambo's Huey, followed by the Sikorsky, descends toward
the landing field.  As the techs and other camp personnel
stand watching, Kirkhill raises a pair of powerful field
glasses.

KIRKHILL'S POV - TELEPHOTO

The image of the Huey seems to waver insubstantially
through the long lens.  It looks like a death ship, the
Flying Dutchman with a crew of corpses and a demon at the
helm, coming in out of the dusk sky.

He slowly lowers the glasses.
Face ashen, Kirkhill backs into the command center and
closes the door.

The Huey sheers sideways across the staging area.
Its skids clip the top of the MOTC, shearing off
communications gear.
It hits the ground.  Bounces.
Slews around, scraping hideously.

And stops.
The Sikorsky settles behind it.

The two choppers whine-down.  Standing beside the cockpit,
Trautman gets on the Sikorsky's loudspeaker.

				TRAUTMAN
		All base personnel.  Prepare medical
		facilities to receive American POWs.

A cheer is raised among the ground contingent as they
surge forward.

ON RAMBO

sliding painfully out of the flight seat.  Brewer gawks at
the pool of blood collected in the hollow of Rambo's seat.

Rambo goes to the gun door.  Takes De Fravio's AK-47.

DOLLYING WITH RAMBO as he limps toward the MOTC with
relentless determination.  The well-wishing ground
personnel fall back, letting him pass.

Trautman, B.G., sees him and strides forward to intercept.

OVER RAMBO'S SHOULDER

DOLLYING, as he approaches the command center.
Kirkhill's aide, in dark glasses, moves forward to
restrain him.

Rambo motions him aside with the AK.
Goes to the door.  It is locked.


INT.  MOTC

The lock is shattered by a LONG BLAST from Rambo's AK.
The door is kicked open.  Rambo stands silhouetted.

He looks like what we never saw in "The Monkey's Paw."
He moves into the humming command center, among the
mission control electronics, reeking of the jungle, blood
and death.

LOW ANGLE

as Rambo walks to Kirkhill, looming.  Stopping.

Kirkhill quails as Rambo grasps him by the collar and
flings him backward into a chair.
He raises the AK.  Muzzle to Kirkhill's forehead.

				RAMBO
		Mission accomplished.

Pulls the trigger.
The weapon CLICKS, EMPTY.

HOLD ON KIRKHILL, trembling.


EXT.  MOTC

Rambo steps unsteadily out into the waning light.
He takes a deep, slow breath.  Starts to walk.  He salutes
as he passes Trautman but says nothing.

In the B.G. they are carrying the POWs in stretchers or
pushing them in wheelchairs toward the MEDICAL TRAILER.
Rambo watches Brewer posing with his arms around Jensen
and another POW for the grunt we saw earlier.  His pocket
Instamatic is clicking away.

				BREWER
			(expansively)
		Cover of Time Magazine, baby!

Rambo walks away... alone.

				DE FRAVIO (O.S.)
		Hey, Rambo!

Rambo turns.  De Fravio, propped up on one elbow on his
stretcher as he is carried past, gives him a broad,
appreciative grin.

				DE FRAVIO
		You did good, buddy.  Real good!

Rambo stands blinking for a second.  He raises his hand in
a big "thumbs up" and allows himself to grin.

FIRST BLOOD II: THE MISSION

				 December 22, 1983










FADE IN:

TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT.  V.A. HOSPITAL - DAY

A drab GREEN SEDAN with U.S. ARMY printed on the door
stops at the steps of a fortress-like colonial-style
building.
Iron bars cover the windows.
The lawn sprinklers snap mindlessly to themselves.
A CRT-style printout appears at the bottom of FRAME:

		D-MINUS 117 HRS
		FAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA

ANGLE ON SEDAN

as the doors open and TWO POWERFUL MPs, one of whom was
driving, emerge.  The other opens the rear door for
COLONEL SAMUEL TRAUTMAN who stands, eyeing the imposing
facade of the hospital.
Trautman is in his early fifties and wears the mantle of
command sternly but without arrogance.

He takes the stairs with purposeful strides, the MPs
falling in behind him.

HOLD ON THE SIGN above the main door as they go inside:

		VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL


INT.  HOSPITAL

A gray metal door bearing the sign "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC WING"
bangs open and a massive ORDERLY in white passes through.
He is followed by the two MPs, Trautman, and a SHORT
DOCTOR who hustles to keep up with the others.

LOW ANGLE DOLLY PRECEDING the entourage as they stride
forward.
The MPs are grim-faced and walk in step.

Trautman and a doctor SINGLETERRY silently walk through
the corridor.

They pass the open day-room where somnambulistic patients
sit like statuary watching "The Young and the Restless" or
watching the wallpaper fade.
Bleak light from an overcast day filters through the
barred window.

The vets seem older than their years and although some
show the physical scars of combat, there is no doubt that
the greatest trauma for these men is behind the eyes.

As they pass the open doors of the rooms of the "chronic
ward", haunted eyes turn toward them.

As they approach the nurse's station for the "chronic
ward" the orderly nods.
The HEAD NURSE turns to her console.

INSERT - AS NURSE'S HAND

hits a button on the console.

TIGHT ON SECURITY DOOR

as a solenoid-operated bolt snaps back with a loud BUZZ
CLACK.
The orderly's good hand shoves the door open.

INT.  "VIOLENT" WARD

The entourage enters a long narrow corridor lined with
locked doors.

POV DOLLYING ALONG CORRIDOR

Occasionally faces appear at the safety-glass windows set
in the doors.  Men whose souls have fled.
Their eyes track us as we move past.

An emaciated MAN in an untied hospital smock and bare feet
stands as if lost in the center of the corridor.

REVERSE ON GROUP

DOLLYING as they detour around the man, whose clawlike
hand catches at Trautman's tunic.
A hoarse, demented SHOUTING issues from one of the doors,
a desperate WAILING from another.


INT.  STAIRWELL

CLOSE ON DOOR LATCH as keys RATTLE and the door opens.

WIDER as the group enters a dark service stairwell.  The
single fluorescent light flickers stroboscopically, a
pulsing twilight.

				LEWIS
		Shit.  Maintenance never gets down
		here.

They descend two flights to a door of steel bars on a
sliding track.

The MPs flank Lewis as he unlocks the door.

				SINGLETERRY
		So what am I supposed to do?  Can't
		transfer him to Leavenworth.  He's
		civilian.  So I put him in an
		isolation cell that hasn't been used
		since the Spanish Inquisition.

TIGHT ON BARRED DOOR

rolling aside on metal tracks.  CLANG.


INT.  CORRIDOR

This area of the hospital's basement has been used for
little but storage in recent years.
Stacks of obsolete equipment gathers dust, leaving only a
narrow walkspace.

The steel doors of the isolation cells yawn open, except
for the last one.

				TRAUTMAN
		Maybe you should have tried cutting
		him some slack.

Lewis opens a cabinet near the single locked cell and
removes a SMALL RIFLE.  He feeds a SYRINGE-LIKE SHELL into
the single-shot bolt action.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		What's that?

				SINGLETERRY
		Tranquilizer syrette gun.  Borrowed
		it from the Animal Control
		Department.

Trautman pushes the barrel aside with a contemptuous snort
and steps up to the cell door.

				TRAUTMAN
		Gimme a break.
			(nods toward door)
		Open it.

The two MPs flank the door.  One pulls on the latching
lever.  Bolts slide.  The door swings open, revealing
blackness.

				LEWIS
			(muttering)
		Thinks he's the fucking Prince of
		Darkness.

One MP tries the switch beside the cell, flicking it
several times.  Nothing.

He glances apprehensively at the other MP and they step
into the dark cell.


INT.  CELL

TIGHT ON A HAND, dimly outlined, as it twists a light bulb
a half-turn in its socket.

In the sudden light the MPs face an imposing figure.

JOHN RAMBO, wearing only a pair of filthy jeans, stands
"ready" before them.  The single light bulb on the low
ceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body.
A nasty piece of machinery.

Long, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkempt
beard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which are
deep, reptilian.  Intense.

His position, though not overtly threatening, suggests a
willingness to strike without warning which gives the
M.P.'s pause.

Trautman steps forward between the MPs.

				TRAUTMAN
		At ease, Rambo.

MED. ON RAMBO

rising from his slight crouch to stand composed,
balanced... parade rest.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing to MPs)
		Wait outside.

He closes the door until it latches.

				TRAUTMAN
		Hello, John.

				RAMBO
		Colonel.

				TRAUTMAN
		Mind if I sit down?

Rambo motions to the narrow bunk, dropping into an
Oriental squat himself as the Colonel sits.

Trautman's manner with Rambo is familiar, somehow
paternal.  A bit of an ironic grin twitches briefly.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		I hear you're not enjoying it here.

				RAMBO
		I could take it or leave it.

Trautman sighs and leans back.

				TRAUTMAN
		Seems like I'm always pulling you
		out of some goddamn toilet or other,
		doesn't it?

				RAMBO
		Am I out of here?

				TRAUTMAN
		That depends on you.
			(pause)
		Christ, look at you.  I give you
		this easy duty until I can get you
		an assignment... all you have to do
		is eat ice cream and watch soap
		operas... and you have to make it
		Rambo's last stand.

				RAMBO
		There were treating me like a
		headcase.

				TRAUTMAN
		Hard to believe.  You shoot up one
		little town in Oregon with a fifty
		caliber machine gun... one little
		dogpatch town... and everybody
		figures your wrapper's broken.  No
		sense of humor.
			(pause)
		What did you expect?  An engraved
		plague from the chamber of commerce?

Rambo looks at his hands.  When he finally speaks his
voice seems distant, disembodied.

				RAMBO
		In 'Nam I flew gunships.  Million
		dollar equipment.  Back here nobody
		trusts me to park cars.  I keep
		thinking it's going to be okay...
		but I've been out six years and it's
		not okay.  Sometimes I feel like I'm
		coming right out of my skin.

The colonel nods slowly.  He notices a battered shoebox on
the floor beside the bed.  The cell is absolutely devoid
of personal articles otherwise.

				TRAUTMAN
		This your stuff?

				RAMBO
		That's it.  My life.

TIGHT ON SHOEBOX

as Trautman flips through a number of worn snapshots of
the men in Rambo's special forces unit.

They are horsing around, in and out of uniform.  A
younger, cleanshaven Rambo is among them.  He is grinning
broadly in one shot.
It seems uncharacteristic of the hardened man we see now.

				TRAUTMAN
		Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever
		trained.

				RAMBO
			(coldly)
		Those men are all dead.

				TRAUTMAN
			(glancing up)
		You're not.

He fishes something from among the pathetic debris of
Rambo's life.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		Congressional Medal of Honor.

				RAMBO
			(bitterly)
		Yeah.  Big time.

				TRAUTMAN
		Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars,
		four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's
		Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of
		Gallantry and... uh, a handful of
		Purple Hearts.

				RAMBO
		Five.  I never wanted that stuff.

				TRAUTMAN
		What did you want?

				RAMBO
			(haltingly)
		I just wanted... I don't know...
		after all that... I just wanted one
		person, one person, to come up to me
		and say "you did good, John." And
		mean it.  That's all.
			(pause)
		After all that.

				TRAUTMAN
		You just picked that wrong war to be
		a hero in.

The colonel studies Rambo a moment, then stands abruptly.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		Let's take a walk.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  V.A. HOSPITAL - DAY

Rambo and Trautman cross the manicured grounds, escorted
by the two grim MPs.

A number of wheelchair-bound vets enjoy the sunshine B.G.
and a desultory game of volleyball is in progress.

Still, the impression is of the detritus of war left
scattered on a huge lawn like broken toys.

As the two approach a conservatively dressed MAN waiting
on a bench under a plane-tree, stands.

				TRAUTMAN
		Jason Kirkhill... John Rambo.

Kirkhill extends his hand in greeting, but Rambo coolly
half-turns to reveal his hands, locked in WRIST-CUFFS
separated by a steel bar so that they can hang comfortably
at his sides.
Kirkhill grins affably.  Drops his hand.

				KIRKHILL
		Good to meet you, Rambo.  How are
		you?

Rambo scans Kirkhill's face, noting the cold scrutiny all
but concealed in the smile lines.

				RAMBO
			(coldly)
		You a spook?

Kirkhill drops the smile.

				KIRKHILL
		That's right.  CIA Special
		Operations Division.

Rambo turns to Trautman.

				RAMBO
		I don't work with spooks.  Not after
		that op in Cambodia.

				KIRKHILL
		I'm authorized to get you out of
		here.  I thought that's what you
		wanted.

				RAMBO
			(considering)
		What's the job?

				KIRKHILL
		Classic special forces op... hit
		fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two
		days.

				RAMBO
		Why me?

				KIRKHILL
			(shrugs non-
			 committally)
		We like you.
			(pause)
		At least the computer at Langley
		likes you.  Pulled your file because
		of various factors.  Service record.
		Area familiarity.

				RAMBO
		Where?

				KIRKHILL
		Not yet.

				RAMBO
		I'm not jumping blind.

Kirkhill's eyes get hard.

				KIRKHILL
		It's yes or no.  In or out... now.
		If it's "out," we will not have had
		this conversation.  If you come in,
		you will not be working for us.  No
		knowledge.  No comment.  Do you
		understand?

Rambo seems about to turn away.

				TRAUTMAN
			(to Kirkhill)
		Tell him.  I'll take responsibility.

Kirkhill looks pained, like he has gas.

				KIRKHILL
		North Vietnam.  What they call the
		Democratic Republic of Vietnam now.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

as he takes that in.  His eyes seem to see all the way
there already.  Emotions go through him.  Exhilaration
mixing with terror of the demon he can't turn away from.
He nods slowly.

				TRAUTMAN
		We left some people behind there,
		John... POWs.

				RAMBO
		This just occurred to somebody, now?

				KIRKHILL
		We don't leave our men, Rambo.

Rambo and Trautman lock eyes.
Something flows there... Trautman knows his soul.

				RAMBO
		You got it.  I'm in.

He whips one hand around from his side, tossing the
manacle bar at a surprised Kirkhill's feet.
The wrist-cuffs are still closed.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  RAMBO'S CELL

Rambo stands alone in his cell, the door open behind him.
He hefts the shoebox filled with his worldly possessions,
the scraps of memory, dead friends, and symbols of valor
and violent death.

He upends the box, spilling everything into the open
toilet.

Flushes it.  And walks out.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  FORT BRAGG - DUSK

		D-MINUS 84 HRS
		FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA

TIGHT ON BOOTED FEET

clomping in rhythmic lockstep as a platoon of recruits
marches past in close order drill.
The drill sergeant bellows cadence.

				SERGEANT (O.S.)
		Three-fo-your-lef, lef-right-lef...
		Other lef shithead!  Square those
		pieces away... square 'em away
		girls!  I said...

WIDER

as the platoon marches past, EXITING FRAME to reveal a
sign mounted beside a security checkpoint in a formidable
chain-link fence.

		AIRBORNE SPECIAL FORCES GROUP
			 OPERATIONS CENTER


INT.  CORRIDOR

Kirkhill, accompanied by his basilisk-eyed AIDE, strides
past Rambo's two MPs flanking the door, into a small
room.


INT.  BRIEFING ROOM

The room is an austere cubicle with the army's typically
drab furniture in "early functional."
The cold eye of a surveillance camera stares down at a
single table with a seated figure... Rambo, looking like
he may have been there for centuries.

The aide hands Rambo a sealed folder and extends a
clipboard and pen for him to sign off.

				KIRKHILL
		This is your mission packet...

				AIDE
			(quietly overlapping)
		Sign here, please.  And here.

				KIRKHILL
		Memorize it here.  It doesn't leave
		this room.

Rambo unseals the folder, removing a sheaf of photocopied
documents, as Kirkhill perches on the table next to him.

				KIRKHILL
			(continuing)
		The twenty-four hundred American
		servicemen missing in action in
		Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are
		officially listed "Presumed
		Killed." Certainly most of them
		are.

Rambo is leafing through the contents of his PACKET.  He
skips a stack of reports and fishes out several grainy 8 X
10 prints.

				KIRKHILL
			(continuing)
		But reports keep filtering in.
		Sightings by refugees.  Nothing
		verified.  Finally, we feel we've
		got enough to proceed on.

Rambo studies the prints.  They seem to be high altitude
surveillance photos of a small COMPOUND OF BUILDINGS,
surrounded by forests.

				KIRKHILL
			(continuing)
		Memo E-7 on top will cover the
		details.  An abandoned Vietnamese
		Army base in the North-central
		highlands may have a compound used
		as an internment camp.  As you can
		see the intelligence is soft.  These
		LANDSAT photos show huts...
		barracks.  It could be anything.

				RAMBO
			(flat)
		What's the plan?

				KIRKHILL
		This operation is in two phases.
		Recon and rescue.  You are phase
		one.  Your two-man team will probe
		the site, confirm the presence of
		American POWs, if any, make
		photographic and tactical
		observations, then proceed to the
		extraction point without engaging
		the enemy.

				RAMBO
		We don't try to pull out any of our
		guys if we find them?

				KIRKHILL
		Negative.  Absolutely not.  The
		phase two assault team will get them
		out.

				RAMBO
			(not pleased)
		We just take pictures?

				KIRKHILL
		Don't look so disappointed.  It
		should be hairy enough... even for
		you.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  DON MUANG AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON

Kirkhill's VOICE continues over the image of: The crowded
airport terminal, as Rambo, carrying a cheap flight bag,
weaves among jostling Orientals.

				KIRKHILL (V.O.)
		Your flight to Bangkok is at 06:30.
		Commercial carrier.  Low profile.
		Rendezvous with Colonel Trautman at
		the Indra.  Room 618.  You'll meet
		your number two man, Lieutenant
		Brewer.  He doesn't get a packet...
		you brief him verbally.

After a flurry of passport stamping Rambo clears customs
and makes his way to the main exit.


EXT.  TAXI STAND - STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Rambo emerges into the stifling humid heat of Bangkok in
May and stands, scanning for a cab.

		D-MINUS 51 HRS
		BANGKOK, THAILAND

Bangkok is a city of fervid motion and the street is
chaotic with traffic.
Stepping through throngs of Asians and tourists Rambo
reaches for the door of a beat-to-hell Citroen taxi
hunkered low at the curb like some metal lungfish.

He spins as a hand lightly touches his shoulder.

				MAN
		Sorry old buddy, I saw it first.

An American in his late twenties, the man speaks with one
of those hard-to-dislike Southern accents.  Probably North
Carolina.
He is lanky but muscular, with boyish good looks and hair
cut so short it barely qualifies as stubble.  Though
dressed in a loud Hawaiian shirt and Madras slacks, it is
painfully obvious the man is military.

His arm is draped around a gorgeous but overly made-up
Thai girl.

				MAN
			(affable)
		I kinda got an important date.

Rambo's eyes narrow as he turns wordlessly and climbs into
the taxi.

The American grins cockily and tosses his bag to Rambo.

				MAN
		No problem.  We'll share it.  Get
		your tail in there, sweet thing.


INT./ EXT.  TAXI

The American and the girl pile into the broad front seat,
to the chagrin of the lizard-faced Thai driver.

				MAN
			(to driver)
		Indra Hotel.  And don't take the
		scenic route, Smiley... I know my
		way around this burg.  Comprende?

Rambo speaks quietly to the driver in Thai.

				RAMBO
			(Thai/subtitled)
		Same place for me.

The girl giggles as the American slips his hand up from
her stockinged knee, between her thighs.

				MAN
		Ah, you fair flower of the Orient.

She giggles, like a chirping bird.

				MAN
			(continuing to Rambo)
		She thinks everything I say is
		funny.  Don't you, Angel-pie?  Man,
		Thai women are the best.  Got the
		kinda legs I like... feet at one end
		and pussy at the other.

He turns to Rambo, who hasn't commented or taken any
observable notice of him.

				MAN
			(continuing)
		You don't say a helluva lot, do you,
		pal?  You speak English?

				RAMBO
			(coldly)
		Sometimes.

The girl coos to the American in pidgin English.

				THAI GIRL
		You got money?  I stay you whole
		week.

				MAN
		Sweet thing, there's nothin' I'd
		like more than to wugga-wugga with
		you for a week, but tonight's all we
		got.

He lowers his voice conspiratorially, leaning close to
her.

				MAN
			(continuing)
		See, I'm on this secret mission, and
		tomorrow mornin' I head out to...

Rambo grabs the man brutally by his collar.

				RAMBO
		That's enough, Brewer.

The American freezes at the sound of his name.  Turns
slowly.

				BREWER
			(realizing)
		You're Rambo?
			(pause)
		Ke-rist!

Rambo speaks sharply to the girl in Thai.

				RAMBO
			(Thai/subtitled)
		Get out.  Now!

The driver, confused, skids to a stop and the girl gets
out into the din of a cluttered shop district.  A flash of
slit skirt and then only fading curses behind them as the
taxi moves on.

				BREWER
			(brightening)
		Jeez, I never would have guessed.
		You undercover, Lieutenant?  Great
		disguise.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  INDRA HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

Trautman, sipping a gin tonic at the window, spins around
as the door flies open.  Brewer storms in, followed a few
paces back by Rambo, who closes the door.

				BREWER
			(to Trautman)
		He says he's team leader on this
		show.

				TRAUTMAN
		That's correct.

				BREWER
			(controlling his
			 fury)
		Begging the Colonel's pardon but I
		understood I was up to lead my next
		mission.

				TRAUTMAN
		Not this one.  You're on
		communications and camera.  Same
		image-intensified gear you used in
		El Salvador last year.

				RAMBO
		This clown almost blew mission
		security on the street.  I'm not
		jumping with him.

				BREWER
			(spinning)
		Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...

				TRAUTMAN
			(sharply)

EXT.  OPERATIONS BASE CAMP - DAY

		D-MINUS 36 HRS
		BAN BUNG KHLA, THAILAND

A small airstrip transects a meadow bounded by rain-
forested slopes.  Wreathed in low clouds the mountains
march into the distance in increasingly subtler shades of
gray like a Japanese watercolor.

Near a cluster of small buildings the scene is one of
manic but efficient activity as the high tech base camp is
assembled.

An enormous SIKORSKY CH-54 "SKY CRANE" lowers a Winnebago-
sized conex container as another roars by.  An Army Corps
of Engineers work crew, stripped to the waist, scurries
through the rotor wash.  The blasting air raises curtains
of muddy spray and drowns out the yelled commands of the
supervisors.

A Vietnam era HUEY UH-1D HELICOPTER nimbly touches down
nearby.  Rambo, in the pilot's seat, slips off his HEADSET
and climbs down.  Brewer and Trautman, in fatigues, jump
out and join him as Kirkhill approaches.

DOLLYING WITH THEM as they emerge from the rotor noise and
Kirkhill motions them toward the MOBILE TACTICAL
OPERATIONS CENTER (MTOC).

				KIRKHILL
		I didn't know you were a stick man,
		Rambo.

				RAMBO
		I was crossed-trained in gunships.

				TRAUTMAN
			(to Kirkhill)
		How long have you been setting up?

				KIRKHILL
		About 22 hours on site.

				TRAUTMAN
		Nice work.

They pass a tent-like CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY under which an
ALL-BLACK SIKORSKY UH-60 "BLACKHAWK" HELICOPTER squats
ominously.  It has no markings or insignia.
There is another canopy behind it, the contents of which
are screened from view.

Nearby is a cluster of CONEX AIRLIFT CONTAINERS, two of
which are joined together to form a building like a
double-wide mobile home.

Another unit contains a roaring generator, a fourth is
topped by TRACKING GEAR.  Cables snake through the mud,
connecting the units.

Kirkhill notices THREE WORK PARTY "GRUNTS" kibitzing
nearby, taking pictures of each other with a pocket
Instamatic.  He snatches the camera from a surprised young
corporal.

				KIRKHILL
		This is a covert operation,
		numbnuts.

He opens the camera and drops the film in the mud.  The
corporal reaches petulantly for the camera.  Kirkhill
drops it casually in the mud as well.

				KIRKHILL
			(to Trautman
			 entourage)
		Check out the command hut.

He opens the door to the large conex unit and follows the
others inside.


INT.  MTOC

The "hut" turns out to be a humming electronic womb.
In the subdued light banks of VIDEO MONITORS glow, and the
status lights of UPRIGHT COMPUTER UNITS line one wall.
Workstations for TRACKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND LONG-RANGE
COORDINATION create a claustrophobic jumble of modular
equipment racks.

				BREWER
		Mission control!

They wipe their muddy feet and enter the air-conditioned
command center.

Rambo gazes around at the jumble of gear.  He runs his
hand over one console, causing a seated technician to
glare at him.

				RAMBO
		All this is for us?

				KIRKHILL
		That's right.

				BREWER
			(to Rambo)
		They call us the field-unit meat-
		puppets.

INT./ EXT.  CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY - DAY

Rambo and Brewer walk in under an expanse of net
camouflage on poles.
Sunlight streams through the foliage cover, creating
bright mottles on a black object F.G.

CAMERA PULLS BACK and BOOMS UP as Rambo moves forward to
reveal the object as an ALL-BLACK JET.  It is a modified
Gulfstream "Peregrine," a small sleek single-engine
executive model, with all insignia and I.D. numbers
removed.

MED. ON RAMBO AND BREWER

as they consider the aircraft.

				BREWER
		Ever do this from a jet? 

				RAMBO
		No.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		It's easy...

They turn to see a lanky long-haired man in a leather
flying jacket duck under the fuselage from the far side
and approach them.

				MAN
			(grinning)
		Just have to jump fast.

Two other air crewmen jump down from the open rear
passenger door of the plane.

				RAMBO
		You the pilot?

				MAN
			(extending hand)
		Yeah.  Doyle.
			(he gestures to the
			 two in the door)
		Lifer and Fuhrman.

Doyle is a product of the sixties' school of ultra-cool,
his brain a little torched by too many methed-out night-
missions.
Fuhrman, the co-pilot, grins too much and Lifer's eyes are
just plain scary.

				RAMBO
		You boys Air Force?

				DOYLE
		Marines.  'Ex' though.  We're
		private contractors now.

				LIFER
		You ever do a tour 'in-country'?

				RAMBO
		Two.  'Eye-corps' mostly.

				DOYLE
			(to Brewer)
		How about you?

				BREWER
			(defensive)
		Vietnam was a little before my time.
		So was Korea, know what I mean?

Rambo and Doyle glance at each other... solidarity before
new-meat bozos.

With each word he plops the torque-wrench onto the
appropriate place.

ON DOYLE

Gesturing as he continues.

				DOYLE
		A straight dash across the Laotian

				LIFER
		Dig it.


INT.  MOTC - COMMAND HUT

Trautman, looking a bit uncomfortable in Kirkhill's
electronic lair, paces behind the seated Special
Operations Officer.

				TRAUTMAN
		How long before you're fully on
		line?

				KIRKHILL
		Couple hours.  Let me buy you a
		coffee.

He turns to a vending machine nestled improbably between
two racks of electronics.

				TRAUTMAN
		You think they'll find any?

				KIRKHILL
			(feeding in change)
		POWs?  I don't know.  But either
		way it'll get that subcommittee off
		our necks.  Cream?

				TRAUTMAN
		Black.  No sugar.

				KIRKHILL
		The League of Families leans on
		Congress.  Then they lean on us.
		Like we don't have enough to worry
		about in a dozen dirtwater
		countries.  Damnit!

He pounds the machine, which refuses to vend.
Trautman watches the Special Operations Officer banging
ineffectually on the COIN RETURN, amid a million dollars
worth of equipment.


EXT.  FLIGHT TENT

A tent next to the camouflage canopy serves as a flight
shack for Doyle and his ground crew.  Crates serve as
tables and stools, and 50-gallon fuel drums are the back
wall.
Doyle, with Rambo and Brewer, continues the game plan.

				DOYLE
		A couple klicks from insertion we go
		vertical to ten thousand and you
		punch out.  Navigate in free fall
		like a regular HALO jump.  You'll
		have a good moon.

				LIFER
			(to himself)
		I got your moon right here...

				BREWER
		No problem.  Duck soup.

Doyle notices that Brewer has casually lit up a cigarette.

				DOYLE
		Hey, man... we got fuel on the deck.
		I don't like flying without a plane.

Brewer glances at the pool of jet fuel around the pumping
area.
Rambo plucks the cigarette from Brewer's lips.

				RAMBO
		No smoking on this mission.  It's
		not healthy.

He looks Brewer in the eye and flicks the lit butt into
the pool of gas.
Which puts it out.

				BREWER
		Son of a bitch!

Rambo saunters away.

				DOYLE
			(appreciatively)
		Nice trick.  Works nine times out of
		ten.


EXT.  BASE CAMP - RUNWAY - DUSK

The steel planking of the pre-fabricated runway rings
under their feet as Rambo and Brewer run laps.  Brewer,
between breaths, is chanting a monologue as they draw
near.

				RAMBO
		Again.

				BREWER
		Insertion.  Call in to base camp by
		TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango
		November for rendezvous with our
		ground contact.  Indigenous agent.
		Co Phuong Bao.
			(in same tone)
		We've been over this three times.

				RAMBO
		You stopped.

Brewer rolls his eyes.

				BREWER
		Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us
		twelve klicks upriver to target at
		Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!

				RAMBO
			(flatly)
		Start over.


EXT.  BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Face-down in the dirt near the flight-line, Rambo and
Brewer are banging off pushups under the floodlight.

				BREWER
			(mechanically)
		... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We

				RAMBO
			(to himself

		Ninety.

				BREWER
		... then proceed downriver to

		Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we
		all live happily ever after and
		that's the last time, Rambo!  I

				RAMBO
		One hundred.

They both collapse, face-down, breathing heavily.  Brewer
rises first.

				BREWER
		Gettin' old, huh?

				RAMBO
		Yeah.
			(pause)
		Second set.  Let's go.

When Rambo rises it is in pushup position, only this time
using one arm.  He starts.  One, two, three...


INT./ EXT.  EQUIPMENT TENT - DAY

		D-MINUS 11 HRS

Brewer lifts an OLIVE-DRAB BOX onto the table inside the
open-tent.  It looks like a large field radio with a
complex console set in the top.

				BREWER
		Transponder-satellite relay.
		TRANSAT.

He taps a small collapsible DISH ANTENNA on a tripod
connected to the box by a curly-cord.

				BREWER
			(continuing)
		The signal's coded into infrared
		pulses, picked up by the spy
		satellite, bounced to the ground
		station in Okinawa and relayed to
		the hut...

He points to the MTOC nearby.

				BREWER
			(continuing)
		No radio source.  Nothing for the
		bad guys to triangulate on.

				RAMBO
		Show me how it operates.

				BREWER
		That's what I'm here for.

				RAMBO
		Show me in case you get zapped as
		soon as we land.

				BREWER

		We're leaving tonight, not in a

He sees Rambo's expression.

				BREWER
		Alright.  Alright.

He hefts an automatic rifle and checks the action.

Another electronic gadget joins the growing array on the

Doyle lounges nearby watching the bugs dog-fighting around
the fluorescent work light.

				RAMBO (O.S.)
		You jumping with all that?

They turn to see Rambo watching them from just outside the
pool of light.
A spectral figure.

Brewer glances at the array of stuff.

				BREWER
		Yeah.  Why not?

				RAMBO
		You break your leg, I'll have to

He turns and vanishes in the dark.

				DOYLE
		I think he means it.

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - BARNYARD

Brewer is face-to-face with a mangy PIG, which grunts its
annoyance.
He is stuck up to his knees in the mud of a small fenced
yard containing a few pigs and chickens.

The yard is adjacent to a large THATCH HUT, and four or
five additional HOOTCHES are visible farther downslope,
nestled among the trees.

Brewer holds a finger to his lips, cautioning the pig to
silence.  He lays backward in the black slop as a
VIETNAMESE MAN in peasant pajamas comes to the door of the
nearest hootch, an island of light in the dark forest.

Smoking a cigarette he looks around, perhaps scanning for
the source of the faint crashing he heard a moment before.

Following a dirt road, little more than a trail between
the hootches, an OLD WOMAN approaches.  She is barefoot,
and pushes a rusting bicycle laden with an enormous bundle
of firewood.

Brewer struggles to free himself, straining in silence as
the pigs step disdainfully around him.

The man flicks away the cigarette.  He laughs raucously at
something the old woman says and hurries to help her carry
the firewood inside.

Brewer looks up, at his chute billowing quietly in the
branches overhead.

The old woman pauses at the door, spits a shot of betelnut
juice into the yard, and goes inside.
The door bangs shut.

sighing with relief.

SUDDENLY A DARK OBJECT SHOOTS INTO FRAME, seizing him.
Brewer's head snaps around.  The object is Rambo's hand,
painted camo-green.

Rambo drags him with a sucking POP from the mud.

Rambo flips open his rucksack.

				BREWER

		That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a

				RAMBO
		There's a compass in the handle.

Brewer gestures at the Russian-made AK-47 slung over
Rambo's shoulder.

				BREWER
		And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every

		Uh... this thing's pretty heavy.
		You got room for it?

Rambo snorts disgustedly.

EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Using a stream bed to navigate through dense growth, Rambo
glides his legs smoothly through knee-deep brackish water.
Brewer follows, swatting and batting at clouds of
mosquitos.

A VIPER glides past them, roiling the surface, and
disappears into twisted tree roots.

				BREWER
		You wanna know why I stood up for
		this show?

				RAMBO
			(moving off)
		No.

				BREWER
		I was in the brig.  They gave me a
		deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf
		cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it
		or anything... it was the symbolic
		value.  Seemed like a good idea at
		the time.

				RAMBO
		That's a real good reason to wind up

				BREWER
		I've seen worse places.

				RAMBO
		There are no worse places.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - LATER

Rambo leads them up a steep trail as a dense NIGHT FOG
creeps over the ridgeline above.

FOLLOWING RAMBO - HANDHELD

as he moves along a narrow game trail.
Shapes loom out of the mist, revealed as harmless trunks
or vines only at the last second.

As they top the rise, the trail opens out onto a plateau-

Serene despite the ravages of centuries, two stone Buddhas
thirty feet tall sit flanking the stairs to the ruined

BLACK WORMS attached to his calf, sucking on him.

Rambo moves off, scanning, unconcerned.

				RAMBO
		Get used to 'em.

TIGHT ON BREWER

lighting a cigarette, his hands tightly cupped around the
glow.  Rambo slaps it out of his hand.
Stomps it out.

				BREWER
			(hissing)
		You fucking crazy?  I need it to
		burn these things off.

				RAMBO
		No cigarettes.

				BREWER
		I had it cupped.

Rambo takes the pack from Brewer's breast pocket and
grinds it into the mud under his boot.

				BREWER
		Look, Rambo.  I've had enough of
		your bad-ass Indian-scout bullshit.
		You're years out of date... I'm
		makin' a career out of teaching you
		the hardware.  As far as I'm
		concerned you're just along to back
		me up.  And I heard about you...
		about how twitchy you really are.
		Kill any civilians lately?

Brewer is hurled against a stone wall and pinned with a
knife to his throat so rapidly he's not sure how it
happened.  Rambo is in his face, speaking very softly.

				RAMBO
		Listen real careful, freshmeat.  I
		don't know why they sent you.  Maybe
		they didn't want to waste a good
		man.  But you screw up once more and
		I'll kill you myself.

Rambo whips away, moves quietly off.

Shaking with rage, Brewer levels his weapon at Rambo's
back.  Then he realizes how silly that would be.
Frustrated, he jogs to catch up.

				BREWER
		Man, are you strict.

Moving in the shadows, Rambo walks through the ruins
noiselessly.  A voice emerges from the mist behind them,
an almost childlike lilt.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		You are first tourist here in long
		time.

Brewer whips around, centering the AIMING DOT of his
sighting laser on a FIGURE sitting on a ledge above them.

Sitting cross-legged and unperturbed is a diminutive
VIETNAMESE WOMAN of about 28.  The dot of Brewer's laser
is centered on her forehead like a Hindu prayer mark.

She is absolutely beautiful, with wide, calm eyes and
strong but sensuous mouth which curves now in a small
quirky grin.

				WOMAN
		You come here see Buddha... ask for
		truth?  Or just lost?

				BREWER
			(whispering)
		Should I waste her?

Rambo pushes his rifle barrel aside and takes a step
forward.  When he speaks it is in FLUENT VIETNAMESE.

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		I'm not lost.  Just looking for
		someone.

				WOMAN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Someone called maybe 'Night Orchid'?

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		That's right.

				WOMAN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		I'm Co Phuong Bao.

				RAMBO
			(to Brewer)
		She's our contact.

				BREWER
			(grudgingly
			 impressed)
		I didn't know you spoke Vietnamese.

Co slides down from the ledge and stands before them,
almost two heads shorter than Rambo.  Her lithe figure is
not entirely concealed by her loose black "pajamas".  She
wears her hair in a long single braid and has the delicate
hands of a child.

				RAMBO
		I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.
			(to Brewer)
		Her name is Co.

				CO
		It means "virgin."  My mother was
		comedian.

				BREWER
		Howdy, Co.

He sticks out his hand but Rambo motions "no".  She bows
slightly.

				BREWER
		Uh, you speak pretty good English.
		Where'd you learn?

				CO
		University of Saigon.  Have Masters
		Degree in economics.  Not use too
		much now... Communists in charge.
		You got time... want to eat?

				RAMBO
		Sure.  Whattaya got?

Co reaches up onto the ledge, her previous perch, and
pulls down a small PACK, actually a FOOD TUBE of the sort
worn over one shoulder by Viet Cong and other Vietnamese
guerrillas.

				CO
			(opening it)
		Nuac mam.

She unrolls several rubber tree leaves holding rice with a
pungent sauce.  Rambo takes the food and the proffered
CHOPSTICKS and, squatting, begins shoveling it expertly.

				RAMBO
		You really got a Masters Degree?

				CO
		Sure.  I only sound like forty-year-
		old in your language.

Brewer fumbles with the sticks.  Switches to fingers.

				BREWER
		What's this stuff on the rice?

				RAMBO
		Fermented fish sauce.

Brewer's expression is less than enthusiastic.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - RIVER TRAIL - NIGHT

With Co leading through the maze of aimless game trails
the group makes its way parallel to a modest RIVER, THE
CA.

				RAMBO
		How do we get upriver?

				CO
		I have arranged transportation.  We
		meet soon.  But I think you to be
		disappointed.

				RAMBO
		Why's that?

				CO
		I go up to this camp two months ago.
		Nobody there.  Empty for years.

Rambo stops, puzzled.

				RAMBO
		Why would they send us to a deserted
		camp?

				BREWER
		Who cares?  Let's just do it and get
		out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid
		in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?

Rambo moves on, still concerned.  something's a bit off.

				RAMBO
		We'll check it out.

				BREWER
		How come we didn't just drop near
		the camp... save this hassle?

				RAMBO
		Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?

				BREWER
		Yeah...

				CO
			(switching to Viet
			 subtitled)
		Where did you find this clown?

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		I thought he was with you.

				CO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Crazy motherfucker.

				BREWER
		What's she saying?

				RAMBO
		She likes you.  Says you're dinky-
		dau.

				BREWER
		What's that?

				RAMBO
		Powerful warrior.

				BREWER
		Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey,
		Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one-
		eyed snake?

Rambo motions suddenly for a "freeze".  Co walks on ahead,
toward the river, as the Americans melt into the shadows.


EXT.  RIVER - MARSHY INLET

A HOUSE-SAMPAN wallows among the naked tree roots in a
brackish inlet off the main river.  On deck are TWO MEN,
loosely speaking.  Possibly two of the most misbegotten
specimens the Orient has to offer.

They raise their AK-47s as Co approaches.  Exchange a few
quick syllables and Co turns, motioning Rambo and Brewer
forward.

As they pass, two more equally unwholesome-looking men
emerge from concealment and follow them to the sampan.

Everybody grips their weapons tightly.

				BREWER
			(under his breath)
		These guys look like they'd sell
		their mothers.

				RAMBO
		Sometimes they do.  They're river
		pirates.  Opium runners.

				BREWER
			(hissing)
		Pirates?  No kidding?

Before they step across onto the sampan, Co introduces the
"captain" in Vietnamese.

Wearing all manner of jewelry, including four wristwatches
and a pair of filthy western-style jeans a size too large,
CAPTAIN TRONG KINH grins and motions them aboard.

The grin reveals bare gum where his upper front teeth
would be.  Obviously broken out in a fight.

				CAPTAIN TRONG KINH
		Wa-ky number one.  You come number
		one sampan.

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Thank you, Captain, for your
		hospitality.  You speak English very
		well.

Grinning wider, Captain Kinh motions them inside the
CABIN, a rambling and dilapidated structure of corrugated
sheet metal and woven bamboo.

Kinh barks orders at his men, who cast off from their
moorings and jump aboard.  The first light of dawn is
breaking through the trees.


INT.  SAMPAN CABIN

A raisin-faced WOMAN in an ao-dai, holding an infant,
shuffles aside as Rambo steps down into the dim smoky
interior.
Brewer, Co and Kinh follow.

The two Americans must stoop in the scaled-down structure.
Every conceivable space is crammed with scavenged or
looted detritus: ammo cases, hubcaps, radios, a TV with no
back, books, dead chickens, an ice-cube tray, a Toyota
bumper, outboard motors... there is no operant logic to
most of it.

				BREWER
		Looks like my room in college.

				CO
		We sleep here today.  Safe here
		while go up river.

				RAMBO
		What about patrol boats?

Kinh opens a greasy wooden locker, takes out his pride and
joy, a Russian-made RPG-7 ROCKET-GRENADE LAUNCHER.

His grin glistens evilly in the gloom.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  BASE CAMP - DAWN

A beautiful sunrise backs the treeline, stretching long
shadows across the quiet camp.


INT.  KIRKHILL'S TRAILER

The interior resembles that of a motor home, complete with
bunks, kitchenette and a small bar.

Kirkhill is on the phone, pacing... agitated.  His
reptilian aide lounges on a bunk.

				KIRKHILL
			(to phone)
		No, sir... we're already committed.
		They're in the jungle right now.  I
		say we play the hand through... if
		they find something we just bury the
		report later.  It's still airtight.
			(pause)
		Yes, sir.

He hangs up.  Runs a hand through his hair.

				KIRKHILL
			(to aide)
		Goddamn it!  Now the goddamn
		satellite shows the camp occupied...
		some trucks or something.

				AIDE
			(grimly)
		Oh, boy.  It's getting dicey.

Their manner becomes guarded when a KNOCK at the door
interrupts them.
The aide unlocks it and admits Trautman.

				KIRKHILL
		What's up?

				TRAUTMAN
		Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a
		fifth wheel in your setup here... I
		thought I'd go out with the
		extraction team tonight.  Unless you
		have an objection.

				KIRKHILL
			(not liking it)
		It's not necessary.

				TRAUTMAN
		I know.

				KIRKHILL
		That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full
		Colonels are supposed to be above
		that sort of thing.

Trautman is calling him on it with a deadpan response.

				TRAUTMAN
		I know...

				KIRKHILL
			(shrugs expansively)
		Have fun.


EXT.  CA RIVER - DAY

Kinh's hideous sampan churns upriver slowly, powered by an
ancient outboard motor.  It passes other river traffic,
small hand-powered sampans manned by figures in broad
conical coolie hats.

With the exception of a rare powered craft, the scene is
that of a Vietnam unchanged by centuries.  The ebb and
flow of regimes and ideologies has little altered the
basics of life here.


INT.  SAMPAN

Rambo watches through a chink in the sheeting of the cabin
as the timeless landscape rolls past.

RAMBO'S POV

A view of the shoreline as brown children splash naked in
the shallows where a row of hootches marches up the hill
on stilts.  The SQUEALS and LAUGHTER come clearly across
the water.

Rambo turns his gaze to the sampan interior.
Two of Kinh's men, Co and Brewer all sleep soundly.

Rambo watches Co, her face serene in sleep.  Childlike.
Beautiful.

							 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  CA RIVER - LATE AFTERNOON

The water is coppery, silhouetting the sampan as it churns
on.

Kinh's wife squats on the foredeck, smoking a long-stemmed
clay pipe.

							 DISSOLVE TO:

INT./ EXT.  SAMPAN - SUNSET

The walnut-faced woman hands Rambo two bowls of nuoc mam.
He passes one to Brewer.

				RAMBO
		Have some armpit sauce.

Brewer groans.  Opens a C-ration can.

				RAMBO
			(to Co)
		How did you get started working for
		the spooks?

				CO
		Spooks?

				RAMBO
		Intelligence work.

				CO
		Oh.  They talk to me at university
		before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.

				BREWER
		Everybody's makin' deals.

				CO
		My brother captain in ARVN... need
		papers to go United States, or North
		Vietnamese will execute.  They make
		deal... I stay here and do work...
		my brother and my son can go United
		States.

				RAMBO
		Your son?

Co's eyes drop and her whole demeaner deflates slightly.

				CO
		Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him
		for eight years.

				RAMBO
		Where's his father?

Co shrugs.

				CO
		Dead.  Killed in war.

Her voice and expression convey the fatalistic acceptance
of one who has seen death in all its forms.  Expects it as
an element of daily life.

				RAMBO
		Where's Nguyen now?  What city?

				CO
			(noting his concern)
		Huntington Beach, California.

				RAMBO
		It's nice there.  He's probably
		digging every minute.  Got a
		surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.

				CO
			(distractedly)
		Nguyen is good boy.

Co gazes at the sunset beyond the door.  A tear runs down
her cheek.  She catches herself.  Wipes it away almost
brutally.  She abruptly goes on deck.

				BREWER
		Some hardened guerrilla fighter they
		gave us.

Rambo freezes him out with an evil look.
Suddenly there is a commotion on deck.  The roar of a
powerful ENGINE.  Co bursts in a moment later.

				CO
		River patrol!

A FAST LAUNCH roars toward them, silhouetted by the
setting sun.  UNIFORMED SOLDIERS on deck bring twin 50-
caliber machine guns to bear.

Rambo and Brewer dive under filthy bunks.  Lock and load
their weapons.  Co pushes junk in over them.
Kinh rips open the cabinet.  Slams the shaft of a rocket
grenade into the launch tube.

Co barks an order at him.  He hesitates.  Lowers the
weapon.

Co removes a small packet of North Vietnamese bills from
inside her blouse and hands it to Kinh.


EXT.  SAMPAN

The patrol boat pulls up in an arc, almost swamping them.
The soldiers on deck wear the uniforms of the North
Vietnamese navy.

The deck gunner racks the bolt on his R.P.K. MACHINE GUN.
The captain shouts RAPID VIETNAMESE on a loud hailer.

Kinh's men lounge on the sampan indolently, looking like
fishermen on an evening trawl.

The scrawny woman feeds an infant at one sagging breast.

The PATROL CAPTAIN draws his service pistol and jumps down
into the sampan, entering the cabin.
Co sits demurely on one bunk as Kinh greets the officer.

The officer begins poking through Kinh's possessions.
He tugs at the crate under the bunk where Rambo lies
concealed.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

absolutely motionless.  The crate beside his head moves.
The officer's boot is visible through a widening crack.
An ARGUMENT IN VIETNAMESE is heard heating up.

BREWER

grips the MAC-11 tightly, releases, grips, releases.
Sweat runs into his eyes.

THE OFFICER

looks severe as he contemptuously thumbs through a sheaf
of bills.
Kinh, gesticulating pathetically adds some more to the
stack.

After a tense moment the officer kicks the crate next to
Rambo and stalks out, tucking the payola in his tunic.

He jumps off the sampan and the patrol boat ROARS on.


INT.  SAMPAN

Rambo and Brewer allow themselves to exhale.

				RAMBO
		How you doing, Brewer?

				BREWER
			(shaken)
		I need a vacation.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - PRISON CAMP - NIGHT

With Co leading, Rambo and Brewer move furtively along a
tortuous trail.  It has rained recently and the forest is
alive with glistening reflections, dripping water.
The trail winds up a steep embankment.

As they reach the top of the rise, CAMERA BOOMS UP over
the shoulder of the embankment to reveal a COMPOUND
beyond, dark except for moonlight.

RAMBO

watches from concealment in the foliage.  He is invisible
with his camo-makeup except for darting eyes.

RAMBO'S POV

looking between the leaves, scanning the prison camp.

Two shabby WOODEN GUARD TOWERS stand at diagonally
opposite corners of the compound.  There is a simple fence
of barbed wire on wooden posts enclosing the area and a
main gate with a sentry box.
THREE LONG WOODEN BARRACKS form a U, filling most of the
compound.  The place seems deserted.

				RAMBO
		Check the tower with your scope.

Brewer raises the rifle, sighting through the massive
starlight scope.

BREWER'S POV - TELEPHOTO

The image is bright, lurid... black and white with a
greenish cast.  Like contrasty daylight.  He pans up the
tower.  A Russian-made P.K. 7.62mm machine gun sits
pointing skyward.  The tower seems unoccupied.

				BREWER
		Nobody home.  Wait a minute!
		Cigarette.

A brief glow of light illuminates the face of a TOWER
GUARD hidden in shadows.

				BREWER
		What's he here for?

Nearby, another GUARD saunters out of the forest dressed
in NVA regular private's uniform with the sleeves rolled
up casually.  His AK-47 is slung over his shoulder.

BREWER

slips the telescopic microphone out of his rucksack and
clamps it to the side of his scope.

He slips on a pair of small earphones and pans the rifle-
scope-mike over the nearest barracks unit.

				BREWER
			(intently)
		Snoring.  Five, six guys.
		Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody
		talking in his sleep.  A toilet
		flushing.

				RAMBO
		Guard barracks.  Take some shots.

Brewer locks a 35mm SLR camera to an adapter on the
starlight scope.
He starts clicking off some shots.

Brewer then scans the long hut across the compound.

				BREWER
		Breathing.  Moaning.
			(suddenly)
		Shit!

He whips off the earphones in pain as a LOW SCREAM echoes
across the camp.
It fades into a delirious moaning.  Stops.

				RAMBO
			(nodding grimly)
		Bad dreams.  Prisoner's barracks.
		Shoot some.

Brewer clicks away.

A TINY ENGINE WHINING draws their attention to the main
gate where a YOUNG WOMAN on a LAMBRETTA SCOOTER pulls up
to the sentry shack.
Brewer zeros on her as she greets the GATE GUARDS.

				CO
		Cyclo-girl whore from village.
		Business slow there.

Rambo takes the earphones, listening to the girl's distant
chattering.

				RAMBO
		She's making him a pretty good deal.

Apparently the guard agrees because he opens the gate and
the girl slips inside.

				RAMBO
		What's that?  By the far tower.

Brewer pans to the distant shape.

				BREWER
		It's a guy in a cage.

				RAMBO
		American?

				BREWER
		Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real
		scrunched up in that thing.

				RAMBO
		Let me see.

RAMBO'S POV THROUGH SCOPE

The image is of an EMACIATED FIGURE slumped in a bamboo
cage.  The man's skin is ghostly white.  He seems almost a
living skeleton, dressed only in ragged shorts.

His wrists are clamped in a wooden STOCK and blood runs
down his arms from the abraded sores.

THE IMAGE ZOOMS CLOSER, MOVES ONTO HIS FACE.  TIGHT.

Though gaunt and filthy, he is clearly CAUCASIAN.

				RAMBO
		Roundeye.

				BREWER
		Alright.  Home run.

				RAMBO
			(angrily)
		Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't
		sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.

				BREWER
		Bastards.  Let's get some shots.

ON RAMBO

MOVING SLOWLY IN as he hands the kluge back to Brewer.

				RAMBO
		That guy's not going to make it.

				BREWER (O.S.)
		Nothing we can do, man.

Rambo decides in that moment.

				RAMBO
		I'm getting him out.

				BREWER
		What?  Are you crazy?  We're
		supposed to take pictures and split.
		You're gonna blow the whole program.

				RAMBO
		You never been in one of those
		things.

				BREWER
		I suppose you have...

Rambo holds his wrists up, right under Brewer's nose...
showing the chafing scars.

				BREWER
		It's orders!  You remember... when
		they tell you to do something and
		then you do it.  John Wayne is dead,
		man.

				RAMBO
			(rising)
		You take pictures and split.  I'm
		going in.

Brewer throws down his rifle.  He's apoplectic.
He can barely form words.

				BREWER
		Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Aw... ke-rist.

Then a slow grin spreads.

				BREWER
		How we gonna do it?

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  CAMP PERIMETER - LATER

MOVING WITH BREWER as he belly crawls to the edge of the
cleared area, just a few yards from the wire.  He is right
under one tower, hidden among ferns.

BREWER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE

as Rambo's silhouette crosses to the wire farther down.


EXT.  COMPOUND

DOLLYING WITH RAMBO at ground level as he crawls under the
wire and undulates from shadow to shadow.

He reaches the nearest building.  Hugs it.
Rambo moves on in silence.  He is barefoot, the pale skin
smeared with mud, and carries only the PISTOL CROSSBOW.
Without rifle, pack, harness or grenades to clatter, he
moves like a spirit in the material world.

Rambo raises one eye slowly over a window ledge.
Inside several guards sleep soundly under mosquito
netting.  Their rifles are stacked against the far wall.

ANGLE ON GUARD

snoring ludicrously loud.  He bats at a mosquito,
grunts... turns over.

ANGLE UNDER GUARD BARRACKS

MOVING with Rambo as he crawls among the support posts.

He freezes as a light is snapped on above him.
It streams down through cracks between floorboards.

Moving very slowly, Rambo squints through a gap.

RAMBO'S POV

A LOW ANGLE on a UNIFORMED GUARD rummaging in a tiny
prehistoric refrigerator, humming to himself.

He takes out a can of COKE, recognizable, although the
label is in Chinese characters.  Rolls it slowly across
his sweaty forehead.  Pops it.  The foam now runs onto the
floor, drips into Rambo's eyes.

The light snaps off.  FOOTSTEPS.  Rambo moves on.


EXT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS

There are two rows of rusted iron bunks set out like a
hospital ward.  Most of them are empty.  Seven aren't.

SEVEN AMERICAN PRISONERS OF WAR

Like the man in the cage they are gaunt, scabrous.
Dressed in ragged peasant clothes too small for them.

One man, bathed in sweat, moans and tosses with malarial
fever.  Another is wrapped so tightly in a fetal position
his face is between his knees.

They have padded the bare springs of their cots with
mattresses of rubber leaves.

Rambo stands a few feet from them as if giving a
benediction, the crossbow raised in one hand.  He moves
on, leaving no trace.


EXT.  GUARD TOWER

The GUARD reclines in a folding chair, nodding to the beat
of unheard music.  A SONY WALKMAN is clipped on his belt
and he has the earphones over his GRAY PEAKED CAP.
He takes a last drag and tosses a cigarette over the
parapet.


EXT.  PERIMETER - RAIN FOREST

TIGHT ON BREWER hugging the ground as the smoldering butt
lands five feet from him... in the pool of light from a
floodlight.  He groans, watching the smoke curl up.

Starts creeping his hand toward the butt.


EXT.  COMPOUND - CAGE

The man inside opens his eyes when Rambo touches his
broomstick neck, feeling for a pulse.

His lips are parched and there is a horrible bruise around
one eye.

				PRISONER
			(barely audible)
		Who're you?

				RAMBO
		American.  Come to get you out.

				PRISONER
		Man, you are one scary-looking
		motherfucker!

				RAMBO
		Can you walk?

				PRISONER
		I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna
		be... stiff.

Rambo quickly picks the lock on the wrist clamps and then
slips his LILE KNIFE from its sheath.
Starts cutting the lashings on the bamboo cage.

				RAMBO
		What's your name?

				PRISONER
		De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio.
		Lieutenant... Air Force.

The door gives way and Rambo steadies De Fravio as he
slumps forward.

				RAMBO
			(shakes his hand)
		Good to meet you, Dave.  I'm Rambo.
		Okay, I'm going to carry you.  Don't
		cough or make any noise.

				DE FRAVIO
		Sure thing, Rambo.  You gettin' the
		other guys, too?

				RAMBO
		Not this time.  We'll be back.

Rambo slings De Fravio's gaunt six-foot frame over his
shoulder in a fireman's carry and heads off in a crouching
run.

LONG SHOT ON RAMBO

crossing a pool of light B.G. as the sentry lounges in
his shack.


EXT.  PERIMETER - RAIN FOREST

Brewer seems to have lost sight of Rambo.  He scans the
camp to the treeline and back.
The filterless cigarette is smoked almost to his lips.

WHAM!  A BOOTED FOOT SMASHES DOWN on his rifle, pinning
one hand.  He looks up at...

A NORTH VIETNAMESE GUARD who holds an AK-47 in Brewer's
face.

With his headphones on Brewer hadn't heard the quiet
approach from behind.

Brewer closes his eyes in profound misery.
There is a soft THUNK.

Brewer opens his eyes as the AK-47 falls into the grass.
Looks up to see...

The guard is leaning back against a tree, motionless.
The VANED TAIL of a CROSSBOW BOLT protrudes from his neck
under the jaw.  He is pinned to the tree, quite dead.

Rambo appears from the undergrowth, still carrying De
Fravio, crossbow in hand.

				RAMBO
			(to Brewer)
		That's two.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Brewer and Rambo, carrying the POW, rejoin Co on the
ridge, where they had left their gear.

Rambo sets De Fravio down and reaches for his boots.
The POW looks dazedly at his rescuers.

His eyes, in hollow sockets, track from one to the other.

				DE FRAVIO
			(weakly)
		You guys are real... aren't you?

				BREWER
		Huh?

				DE FRAVIO
		Sorry, I mean... I talk to people
		all the time... I know a lot of them
		aren't there.  But this is real,
		isn't it?  You're taking me home
		now?

				BREWER
		That's right, buddy.

De Fravio sits frozen for a moment, then a dry sob wracks
his entire body and he puts his arms around Brewer.
He cries with utter abandon, quietly, while Brewer looks
at him helplessly.

				DE FRAVIO
		Thank God... thank you...

Brewer looks at Rambo with a stricken expression.  Then
puts his arms clumsily around De Fravio, like somebody
holding a baby for the first time.

Co touches Rambo's hand.  Motions "let's go" with a cock
of her head.  He nods.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR PRISON CAMP - LATER

A stocky SERGEANT OF THE GUARD stands over the partially
concealed body of the guard Rambo killed.

He raises his whistle and sends a SHRILL BLAST across the

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - RIVER BANK - NIGHT

The sampan waits beyond a screen of trees as Brewer calls
in on the TRANSAT.  Co is helping De Fravio walk
unsteadily down to the boat, B.G. The river bandits eye
the tall, death-like figure suspiciously.

				RAMBO
		We'd better go for the emergency LZ

Brewer starts typing.

De Fravio seems a little more in focus as he sits huddled
with the others in the cramped cabin.

				DE FRAVIO
		I gotta tell you, it's just luck you

		us around a lot... We only been at
		that camp a week.  Got a smoke?

				BREWER
			(pointedly)
		No.

				DE FRAVIO
		What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you
		call this?

				RAMBO
		Why were you in the box?

				DE FRAVIO
		Well, I caught this cobra, see...

				BREWER
		You mean the snake?

				DE FRAVIO
		Yeah.  It's not hard once you get
		the hang of it.  In the wrist.
		Anyway, I did what I always do when
		I get one...

				BREWER
		What's that?

				DE FRAVIO
			(straight-faced)
		Put it in the guard's barracks.
			(pause)
		Man they got pissed.  They beat the
		crap out of me, but... it's kind of
		a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run
		around.

				RAMBO
			(chuckling)
		You got a bad attitude.

De Fravio grins, showing bad teeth as well.

				DE FRAVIO
		I know it.

De Fravio eyes Co as she hands him a plate of rice and
meat.

				DE FRAVIO
		Thanks lady.  You're pretty cute...
		doing anything this weekend?

				CO
			(smiling)
		Eat slowly.  Don't make yourself
		sick.

She exits with the dirty cooking utensils.


EXT.  SAMPAN

When Co closes the door to the cabin, Kinh sidles up to
her and rapidly whispers something in Vietnamese.
He seems to be eliciting a response and eyes her warily.

Co freezes indecisively, then nods yes.

In the stern, B.G., one of Kinh's men is talking quietly
on a beat-up military-style FIELD RADIO.
His voice is masked by the sound of the outboard motor.

Co whispers something and holds out her hand, palm up.
Kinh grins, gaptoothed.  He pulls a .45 PISTOL from his
belt and slips it to her.  Runs his finger along the curve
of her neck.  She quietly pulls the cocking slide,
chambering a round.


EXT.  CA RIVER - INLET

The sampan glides into the brackish estuary amid half-
submerged trees.  It is the original rendezvous point.

Everyone assembles on deck, with Rambo helping De Fravio
through the cabin door.
Brewer checks his watch.

				BREWER
		Twenty-five minutes.  We'd better
		roll.

Rambo freezes... looks down.
An AK-47 muzzle is pressed into his kidney, held by one of
Kinh's men.
Two more are covering Brewer, who had just handed his
rifle to Co, while donning his pack.

Kinh steps up, grinning.  Takes Rambo's rifle.  A fourth
guard eases an arm around his neck, a long knife held
under his jawline.

It has all happened smoothly and with precision planning.

				KINH
		Wa-ky number ten.  Do-ma.

				DE FRAVIO
		Yeah, fuck your mama-san, too.  In
		the...

Kinh backhands him to the deck.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

his eyes cold, looking at Co.

She advances on him.  Her black almond-shaped eyes
glitter, alien as the depths of space.

She spits in his face.
Kinh snorts a feral laugh.
Rambo doesn't react.

E.C.U. CO

Her eyes dart to the side.

RAMBO AND CO

something, a microsecond flash of understanding, passes
between them.

				BREWER
			(enraged beyond
			 belief)
		You slope bitch!

She whirls on him, drawing the .45.  It is enormous in her
child's hand.  Her expression is terrifying.

SHE FIRES

The renegade behind Brewer ROCKETS BACKWARD, his FACE
EXPLODING.

Rambo moves, slapping his guard's elbow, driving the knife
across and away.  His teeth snap shut on the man's
forearm.  The knife falls.

Rambo's hands are simultaneously seizing the other guard's
AK-47 just as he fires.  Rambo holds his hand on the man's
trigger hand, AIMING THE GUN.

BULLETS RAKE FROM GROIN TO FACE on the third man standing
opposite them.
HE SPINS BACK, his rifle BLASTING AWAY harmlessly into the
sky.

Co places the muzzle of the .45 against Kinh's temple.
His grin is long gone.
SHE FIRES WITHOUT HESITATION.

Rambo drives the butt of the second man's AK-47 into his
stomach twice.  The bandit lets go.

Firing blind over his shoulder, Rambo vaporizes the head
of his guard, whose hand he still grips viciously in his
teeth.  He releases the hand.  Almost like spitting out
the dead man.

Clutching his stomach, the last bandit leaps to the shore.
FIFTEEN ROUNDS FROM BREWER'S SILENCED MAC-11 stutter
quietly into him.  He pitches face-down in the mud.

A cloud of blue cordite smoke disappears in silence.
The whole thing lasted four seconds.

				DE FRAVIO
			(slowly)
		Wow!

				BREWER
		What just happened?

Rambo moves over to Co.
She seems to sag, depleted.  In shock.
He takes the .45 from her limp fingers.

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Are you okay?

				CO
			(answering in
			 English)
		Yes.  But I lose many merits in next
		life.  Very bad.

				RAMBO
		Why'd they want us?

				CO
		They heard about escaped prisoner on
		radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.

				BREWER
		They sold us out?  Now I'm pissed.

				CO
		They were fools.  To think there
		would be reward.  And to ask my
		help.

Rambo puts his hands on her shoulders.

				RAMBO
		Thanks.

				CO
		Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh
		say meet them here.  Whole garrison
		from Con Cuong is out.

				RAMBO
			(nodding grimly)
		Let's go.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - LAOS - NIGHT

At treetop level the all-black UH-60 ROARS down a forested
valley at 180 mph, using no illumination but the moon.

MOVING WITH THE HELICOPTER

as it rises and drops with the terrain.


INT.  UH-60

Once again Doyle is night-flying in a blacked-out cockpit,
putting the landing skids through the treetops.

Trautman stands behind the seats in the main bay.

Night air ROARS in the open door and Lifer, on door gun,
dangles his legs in the windstream.  The rain forest is a
dim blur very close below.

				LIFER
			(shouting)
		Back in Indian country.  Just like
		old times.

He racks the bolt on his M-60 and grins.
Trautman nods politely and looks at his watch.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR WAT - PRE-DAWN

Rambo's group circles the ruins as they head for the
landing zone.

The trail skirts an escarpment which drops over a hundred
feet to the Ca River below.  Not far from the overgrown
spires of the Wat is a stream which breaks over the cliff
in a graceful waterfall dropping unimpeded into a lagoon.
The vista is quite stunning in the moonlight.

Brewer is struggling with both packs plus the heavy
Transat, since Rambo has De Fravio and Co has her own
pack.  Brewer scrambles, slipping back on the steep trail.

				BREWER
		Let's ditch this Transat.  We don't
		need it.

Rambo considers for a moment, then pulls away some
underbrush beside a collapsed wall of the ruin.

				RAMBO
		Bury it here.  Work fast.

Brewer gets out his entrenching tool.

A cold pre-dawn light suffuses the rain forest, giving it
an expectant quality.
Rambo scans the ridgeline with Brewer's scope.

RAMBO'S POV - TELEPHOTO

Figures of TWENTY OR MORE VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS can be seen
threading among the trees.

				RAMBO
			(to Co)
		You better take off.

				BREWER
		Ain't you coming with us, sweet
		thing?

				CO
		My orders stay here.

She turns to head off along a diverging trail.  Rambo
touches her shoulder.  She turns.

				RAMBO
		See you in California.

Her grin is ironic.

				CO
		Land of big PX.  Maybe I take you
		for a ride in my Cadillac.

Rambo watches her go.  A tiny, anonymous peasant girl.


INT./ EXT.  UH-60 - DAWN

Trautman watches over Doyle's shoulder as the helicopter
roars between the walls of a mountain pass.  The ship is
buffeted by turbulence, bouncing and dropping violently.

				FUHRMAN
			(turning)
		Three minutes.

The steep slopes fall away and Doyle dives the ship across
the rolling foothills.

We HEAR a faint call, barely audible over static.

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Zen Hammer this is Slam Dunk One, do
		you copy?  Over.

				FUHRMAN
		Roger, Slam Dunk One... what is your
		position?


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR PADDIES - DAWN

Rambo is crouched with Brewer and De Fravio in a hollow
beside an earth dike.

They are taking AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE from the trees
nearby.
Spurts of earth leap up around them.

Rambo is shouting in a controlled articulate voice into a
small PRC-90 FIELD RADIO while Brewer lays down
SUPPRESSING FIRE with his M-16 A2.

				RAMBO
			(yelling)
		Zen Hammer... the heat's on.  We're
		taking fire.  Watch for my smoke.
		Red and green.  Northwest corner of
		a big paddy.
			(to Brewer)
		Let's move.

Rambo and Brewer, carrying De Fravio, charge up and over
the dike as the ground is ripped around them.

Rambo hurls two SMOKE GRENADES down the dike wall.
Columns of red and green smoke begin roiling upward.

The dike on which they are pinned down forms part of the
enclosure for a complex of terraced RICE PADDIES which
occupy the few flat acres of this hilly terrain.  The
flooded fields reflect the pre-dawn sky like plates of
burnished metal.

Rambo slams in another clip and fires in short, controlled
burst.  Brewer hands a captured AK-47 to De Fravio.
The ex-POW opens up with a vengeance.

				BREWER
		Go for it, man.  Good therapy.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEARBY

VARIOUS ANGLES as THREE TROOP TRUCKS slide to a halt on a
rutted jungle road, disgorging squads of NVA TROOPS.

Mortars are set up.  Roughly aimed.  THEY FIRE with a
CHARACTERISTIC WHUMP.

ON THE DIKE

The Americans duck as a mortar round explodes in the paddy
behind them, throwing up a geyser of mud.  Brewer picks up
the PRC-90 mike.

				BREWER
			(on radio)
		You guys comin' or what?


INT.  UH-60

Through the front canopy distant wisps of red and green
smoke can be seen.  The paddies rush by below in a blur.

				FUHRMAN
		Roger... we have you on visual.  We
		are coming in.  How many are you?

				BREWER (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Three.  We got an American POW with
		us.

				TRAUTMAN
		Relay to command.  They have one of
		ours.


INT.  COMMAND SHACK - THAILAND

Kirkhill is pacing behind the main console.

				TELECOM TECH
		Mr.  Kirkhill... I have an AWACS
		relay.  Zen Hammer reports the
		ground team has an American POW with
		them.

Kirkhill's reaction is unexpected.  He whips around.

				KIRKHILL
		What did you say?

				TELECOM TECH
			(grinning)
		They've got one of ours.

TIGHT ON KIRKHILL

as a look of frustrated rage is replaced by deadly calm.

				KIRKHILL
			(loudly)
		This station is now on Condition
		Bravo.  Harrison.  Meyers.  Goodell.
		Out... now!

The puzzled techs drop their headsets and leave.

				KIRKHILL
			(continuing to tech)
		Go to your COMINT priority
		frequency.  Give me the mike... Zen
		Hammer, this is Coach One.  This is
		an Alpha-Kilo-Victor command
		priority.

				FUHRMAN (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Roger, Coach One... go ahead.

				KIRKHILL
		I want you to abort the operation
		immediately.


INT.  UH-60

Fuhrman can't believe it.

				FUHRMAN
		Say again, Coach One?

He presses the helmet-headphone tight to his ear, then
turns to Trautman, cupping his hand over the mike.

				FUHRMAN
			(to Trautman)
		He wants us to abort before pick-up.

				TRAUTMAN
		Confirm it.

				FUHRMAN
		It is confirmed.
			(to mike)
		Coach One... we have them in
		sight...
			(pause)
		Yes, sir.

Doyle looks at both of them and shrugs.

				DOYLE
		Turnin' around.

				FUHRMAN
			(to Doyle)
		I thought you liked those guys.

				DOYLE
		I do.  But they ain't payin' the
		rent, Jack.

				TRAUTMAN
		Stay on your heading, Captain.

				DOYLE
		Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.

				TRAUTMAN
		That's an order.

				DOYLE
			(implacable)
		Sorry, Sir.

Trautman has his hand on the butt of his .45 when he hears
the clack of a rifle bolt over the rotor noise and turns.

Lifer has an M-16 in his lap, not exactly aimed at the
colonel, but not aimed away, either.

				LIFER
			(smirking)
		We ain't Uncle Sam's misguided
		children no more, Colonel.  We're
		independent contractors.

				FUHRMAN
		That's right, Sir.  We don't like
		this, but we are working for Mr.
		Kirkhill.

				TRAUTMAN
		You pathetic scum.

				DOYLE
			(looking down)
		Well, if there weren't POWs before,
		there are now.


EXT.  RICE PADDY

Rambo half-supports De Fravio with one arm and fires his
AK with the other as they slog through the calf-deep
water.  Mortar rounds explode on all sides.  They watch
the UH-60 skimming in low across the paddies, blasting up
a curtain of spray.

Almost to them...

It veers in a tight bank and climbs out.

Heads away.

				BREWER
		Where's he going?
			(to radio)
		Hey, Zen Hammer, where are you
		going?
			(pause)
		Do you read, Zen Hammer?  Over.  Son
		of a bitch!  They're ditching us!

The water is shot into spray around them.  A mortar shell
lands so close it knocks them down, drenching them with
slimy black mud.  The radio disappears in the water.
Rising, Brewer takes a round in the thigh.  Drops.
Disappears for a second... comes up gasping.

Rambo watches the UH-60 diminishing to a black dot.
He is so consumed with rage that his expression goes
slack... blank... a murderous disconnection from
conscience.
And yet, in that same moment, a tremendous surge of blind
will clears his mind, a determination to survive, to get
out at whatever cost... to find whoever did this.

It is no longer just a mission.  It is a very personal
piece of business.

He turns and lets his rifle drop into the water.  He takes
De Fravio's and throws it away.

				BREWER
			(through gritted
			 teeth)
		The fuckers left us, man... they
		left us.

Brewer wallows weakly, his blood streaming out into the
muddy water.

De Fravio looks stunned, lost... eviscerated.
He sags to his knees.

				DE FRAVIO
		Oh... God.

It gets quiet.
In a ragged line, the NVA soldiers advance to the top of
the dike.  Twenty.  Forty.  Finally almost eighty, looking
down at the Americans.  Rambo slowly raises his hands.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - HILL NEARBY

OVER THE SHOULDER of Co, watching from behind a screen of
foliage as the ring of NVA troops converge on the tiny
figures of Rambo, Brewer and De Fravio.

REVERSE

TIGHT ON CO, her expression enigmatic.  She turns and
darts away, vanishing into the forest.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  KIRKHILL'S TRAILER

Kirkhill is pouring scotch over ice in two glasses as the
door behind him bangs open.

Trautman's expression could slice a steak.

				KIRKHILL
		Have a drink.

Kirkhill offers a glass to Trautman who ignores it.

				TRAUTMAN
		Why?

Kirkhill sets the glass down and sits at the dinette,
motioning Trautman to sit as well.

				KIRKHILL
			(shrugs)
		You got five hours?  I'll tell you
		about Secretaries of State, and
		funding committees and diplomatic
		relations...

Trautman slowly sits opposite him, his demeanor becoming
more reasonable.

				TRAUTMAN
		Take your time.

				KIRKHILL
		Look, Colonel... we're all adults
		here.  This is a war.  A very quiet,
		very intense war.  People get
		sacrificed.

				TRAUTMAN
		Not my people.

Kirkhill freezes, glancing down.
The muzzle of Trautman's service .45 is jammed into his
groin.

				TRAUTMAN
			(continuing)
		But you're right... some people do
		get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you
		pulled the plug.

				KIRKHILL
		You think I'm some whacko?  I like
		to hurt people?  I'm doing a job
		here.  If I knew what's right or
		wrong I'd be a goddamned priest,
		right?  So I follow directives... I
		do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If
		your boy had done what he was told,
		there wouldn't be a problem.

				TRAUTMAN
		Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be
		walking funny.

Trautman leans on the .45 a bit and Kirkhill backs into
the seat cushion.

				KIRKHILL
		Look, it was a screw-up, alright?
		They weren't supposed to find
		anything.  We thought that camp was
		empty.

				TRAUTMAN
		This mission was a scam from the
		word go?

				KIRKHILL
		Word came down... they wanted an
		answer.  And they knew the answer
		they wanted: no POWs.  But it had
		to look good.  Best effort.  The
		whole dog-and-pony show.

Kirkhill takes a healthy pull from his scotch.

				TRAUTMAN
			(realizing)
		Rambo and Brewer were selected as
		write-offs.

				KIRKHILL
		It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo
		was a decorated Vietnam vet, a
		former POW himself... if he came out
		and said "No POWs" the sub-committee
		would buy it.  He gets himself
		caught he's a private citizen, a
		whacko, acting on his own.  If he
		gets proof, it gets lost somewhere
		between here and D.C.  Airtight.
		But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero.
		Thinks he's starring in his own war
		movie or something.  He put me in a
		corner.  No choice.

				TRAUTMAN
		"Terminate with extreme prejudice."

				KIRKHILL
		That's a crock.  We don't say that.
		Do you have any idea the shitstorm
		if he'd gotten back with that guy?
		If it went public?  The White House
		would have to act through channels.
		We're talking ransom.  Four billion
		bucks in war reparations to Vietnam
		to get the others back.  That's
		billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For
		a few guys that've had their brains
		in a blender for ten years?  A pain
		in the ass to everybody?  No way.
		There's no way.

The colonel has let the pistol drop, until it is dangling,
forgotten.

				TRAUTMAN
		So there never was a Phase Two
		rescue team?

				KIRKHILL
		Of course not.  You can't get
		approval to rescue a kitten from a
		tree after Tehran.

After a long silence, Trautman nods.

				TRAUTMAN
		I understand.

Kirkhill relaxes.  It's going to be okay.  The colonel is
one of the boys.

				KIRKHILL
		Here.  Drink.

Trautman doesn't take the glass.

				TRAUTMAN
			(reasonably)
		I understand your position.
			(pause)
		I understand how a maggot like you
		can just slide out of a jam on a
		trail of slime.  And call it --
		expedience.
			(viciously)
		Expedience!

Kirkhill slams his empty glass down.  His tone becomes
self-righteous.

				KIRKHILL
		You're out of your depth, Trautman.
		Way out.  I'm acting correctly here.
		Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle
		ace.
			(pause)
		It's over.  Walk away.

				TRAUTMAN
		It's not over.  You made one
		mistake.

				KIRKHILL
		What that?

Trautman clicks the safety and reholsters the .45.

				TRAUTMAN
		Rambo.


EXT.  PRISON CAMP - VIETNAM - DAY

		D-PLUS 36 HRS
		BAN KIA NA
		REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM

TIGHT ON RAMBO

his eyes ablaze, face crusted with dried mud and sweat.

WIDER

revealing him under guard, arms bound painfully tight
behind him, in the back of a troop truck.

He is seized by TWO VIET SOLDIERS and dragged forward, off
the truck.
De Fravio hits the ground behind him, and Brewer, moaning
on a stretcher, is unloaded.  His fatigues are matted to
the skin by dried blood from hip to knee.

Camp commander CAPTAIN VO QUOC VINH strides across the
compound.  He is fairly twitching with suppressed rage at
the loss of face brought on by his useless guards.

He screams orders as the troops dismount, roughly dragging
forward the three captives.

A VIET SERGEANT turns the captives over to CHIEF GUARD
SERGEANT TRAN VAN TAY with a quick salute.

The instant Vinh stops shouting Tay begins, like a relay.
The prisoners are prodded forward.

Rambo walks beside a wide-eyed Brewer.

				BREWER
		Are they going to torture us?

				RAMBO
			(distantly)
		Yes.

				BREWER
		What... whattaya do?

A GUARD shoves Rambo on ahead as Brewer's carriers stop at
the door of an isolation cell.

				RAMBO
			(looking back)
		Hope they kill you by mistake.

Rambo's guard slams his rifle butt into the American's
belly, half-doubling him over.

				GUARD
		No talk!


INT.  ISOLATION CELL

The door to a tiny fetid room is opened and Brewer is
dumped off the stretcher and flung inside.  He lands on
his knees and gasps in pain, clutching his leg.

The door clangs shut, leaving stifling gloom.

				BREWER
			(groaning)
		This ain't happening.


INT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS

De Fravio is helped back to his bunk by one of the other
prisoners.  There are few moments in human experience as
devastating as the return to prison (especially this
prison).  The absolute abandonment of hope.

Several of the POWs sit near him, silently offering their
support.  It is evident that two of the men, B.G., are as
autistic as De Fravio, having succumbed to that withdrawn
plane long before.

JENSEN, a prisoner with one leg, settles beside De Fravio
on his bunk.  Puts a spidery hand on his shoulder.

				JENSEN
		We were pulling for you, Dave.  We
		hoped you'd make it.

De Fravio's eyes focus.  The merest spark of the old
defiant De Fravio glimmers wanly.

				DE FRAVIO
		Next time.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - DUSK

LOW ANGLE on Sgt. Tay, powerful and vicious-looking as a
rabid ferret.  He raises one fist, holding a LENGTH OF
RUBBER STRAP cut from a truck tire, and smashes it down
OUT OF FRAME.

There is a SICKENING THUD against flesh.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

grimacing from the blow.
There are board red welts over both collarbones, oozing
blood in places.

WIDER

showing Rambo on his knees, at the center of a bare
CONCRETE ROOM.  A single window admits a shaft of red
dusk-light, like a spotlight.
Rambo sways in the spotlight, glistening with sweat,
stripped to his G.I. shorts.
In the four corners of the small room are guards with
rifles.  Others crowd in the doorway, grinning and
jostling to see.

WHAM!  The truncheon descends against Rambo's face.
He sprawls onto the floor face-down, nose streaming blood.

Capt. Vinh enters with a strident shout, stopping Tay
from another blow.  The two officers exit at a run,
leaving Rambo on his face before the guards.


EXT.  CAMP COMPOUND - DUSK

An unearthly wind and the THUNDER of several helicopter
rotors fills the camp.
Two American-made "HUEY" HELICOPTERS descend to lumpy
landings near the guard towers.

One is a UH-1D "Slick" troop carrier and the other is a
UH-1B Gunship outfitted with a pedestal-mounted MINIGUN
and M-60 door gun.
Captured from the ARVN in 1975, both ships bear the
insignia of the Republic of Vietnam.

Beyond the guard tower, and dwarfing the two Hueys, an
ENORMOUS HELICOPTER ROARS out of the setting sun.
RUNNING LIGHTS and STROBES FLASH as the massive silhouette
drops into the courtyard raising a blast of dust.

It is a SOVIET MIL MI-24 assault helicopter.

Its double blister canopies look like huge insect eyes.
The STUBWING WEAPONS PODS bristle with rockets and
cannons.
It is painted with jungle camouflage and bears the red
star insignia of the SOVIET NAVAL AIR WING.

The Viet officers and guards cringe against the rotor
blast as the ship settles.  The side door slides open.

DOLLY BACK, PRECEDING TWO RUSSIAN OFFICERS who tower above
the Vietnamese as they stride across the camp.

Vinh points to the concrete blockhouse and the officers
stride past him without slowing.  He falls in behind them,
trying to keep up.


INT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS

Jensen turns from the window as the MIL MI-24's jet-whine
fades.

				JENSEN
		It's those Russian interrogators
		again.

Everyone looks grim.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Vinh sends the gawking guards scurrying with strident
yells as he follows the two Russians into the room.  The
Soviets stand in front of Rambo.  The shorter of the two,
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER YATI PODOVSK, has the slight build
and unremarkable features of a bank clerk, though for a
man in his forties he is in superb condition.  The other,
LIEUTENANT PALYUSHIN, is another story.  He is a tall
broad slab of combat muscle, his black hair cut short as a
scrub brush.  Thick and functional as state sculpture, his
features cannot fill his broad, flat face.

Both wear the khaki field dress and black beret of the
Naval Spetznatz Brigada, The "Special Operations Brigada".

At Palyushin's feet, Rambo finds himself looking up at his
Soviet opposite number, the BLACK BERET.

				PODOVSK
			(in Russian)
		Put him in the chair.

Palyushin hauls Rambo onto a wooden stool against the
wall.  Podovsk sits next to him on a small metal desk.

It is almost dark and the only light is from a single bare
bulb.

				PODOVSK
			(Viet to Vinh)
		Thank you, Captain Vinh.  Leave one
		guard, please.

Vinh exits with Tay and the other three Viets.

Podovsk adjusts his wire-rim glasses and considers Rambo.
He turns Rambo's bloodied face gently, examining the
injuries.

				PODOVSK
		These people are so... vulgar in
		their approach.  I am Lieutenant
		Commander Podovsk.  I do not know
		who you are.  Will you tell me?

Podovsk's English is lightly accented but clear and
articulate.  He has a nasal condition, however.  Rambo
doesn't answer.

				PODOVSK
			(continuing)
		No?  Not even your name?
			(silence)
		This is a poor beginning for an
		intimate relationship.  By tomorrow
		or the next day you will tell me
		things you would not tell a lover.

Podovsk notices the long criss-crossed scars on Rambo's
chest and back.

				PODOVSK
			(continuing)
		I see you are no stranger to pain.
		Then of course you must know how
		senseless it is to resist in the
		long run.  Is it possible you have
		been among my Vietnamese comrades
		before?

Podovsk catches something as Rambo breaks his gaze,
looking away.

				PODOVSK
			(continuing)
		Yes.  I think that must be it.
		Where were you held?  Hanoi?  Son
		Tay?  I apologize.  I'm getting
		ahead.  Sometimes I get too eager.
		My comrade and I, in our capacity as
		advisors, have been sent from our
		center at Cam Ranh Bay to discover
		from you certain things... for
		example: whether you are working
		directly for the American
		government... Who your contacts
		were... and on and on.  Quite a
		list.  Will you tell me these things
		now?

Rambo gazes at a point in space.

				PODOVSK
			(continuing)
		Of course you won't.  But, as a
		moral man, I felt compelled to ask.

He stands with a shrug of finality and gestures to his
massive assistant.

				PODOVSK
		This is Lieutenant Palyushin.  To
		him you are a piece of meat.
			(in Russian to
			 Palyushin)
		Proceed.

LOW ANGLE

on Palyushin walking forward.


EXT.  CAMP - MAIN GATE - NIGHT

The guard in the sentry box glances up from a newspaper at
the SOUND of an approaching MOTORBIKE.  A YOUNG WOMAN
wearing an ao-dai and coolie hat rides up on a HONDA
SCOOTER and stops by the shack.

OVER THE GIRL'S SHOULDER

as she steps up to the guards box and coos something to
the sentry.  He grins to see a new face among the whores
from the village, and one so pretty... great luck.

REVERSE ON GIRL

revealing that she is Co, as she dickers price through the
sentry box window.  He unlatches the gate.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

An IRON BED FRAME has been brought in and leaned
vertically against the wall opposite the door.

Rambo has been tied to the frame spread-eagle by lengths
of COAT HANGER WIRE around his ankles, neck and forearms
at the elbows.

Palyushin is setting up a box-like PIECE OF EQUIPMENT on
the small desk.  There are wires running from the bedframe
and from a METAL PLATE about the size of a paperback book
taped to Rambo's belly.

Palyushin clamps the other ends of the cables to terminal
posts on the box, which has a large RHEOSTAT knob and
several switches and dials.

				PODOVSK
		I was sent here because of my
		command of your language.  It will
		be frustrating if we cannot have a
		nice chat.  Very frustrating.
			(Russian to
			 Palyushin)
		Ready?

Palyushin nods and douses Rambo with a BUCKET OF WATER.

				PODOVSK
			(Russian)
		Test please.

Palyushin, without ceremony, twists the knob.

Rambo convulses with an explosive muscle contraction.
Slams against the springs.  His veins swell as if to
burst.


EXT.  CAMP COURTYARD

The lights of the camp dim, flickering, under the current
load.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Rambo slams convulsively against the electric grid formed
by the steel bed.  His teeth are clenched as if he has
tetanus.


INT.  PRISONERS' BARRACKS

The lights come up to normal brightness.
De Fravio closes his eyes, sharing a ghost of the pain.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Rambo hangs from his bonds, heaving and shivering.

Podovsk turns to him conversationally, as if he were an
acquaintance at work rather than a man being tortured.

				PODOVSK
		Oh, yes.  Here is something you
		might be interested in.

He draws a folded piece of paper from his pocket.  Opens
it.

				PODOVSK
		A transcript of the conversation
		between your helicopter pilot and
		his commander, intercepted and
		unscrambled by our overworked
		cryptography staff.
			(reading)
		Mmm.  "Zen Hammer... Slam Dunk."
		Colorful names.  Here we are: "Ah,
		Coach One... we have them in sight."
		And the reply: "Abort immediately.
		Return to base camp."

He graciously shows Rambo the printout.

				PODOVSK
		It seems they intentionally
		abandoned you on direct orders.
		There are the people you protect
		with your silence?  With your pain?

He snaps his fingers and Palyushin cranks the knob.
The lights dim.

Rambo fights the scream unleashed within him with every
fiber of his being.  Straining like a demon, every muscle
sharply defined and rock hard.

				PODOVSK
			(almost kindly)
		But you must scream.  You must.
		There is no shame.

It bursts out, a roar that frays his vocal cords.


EXT.  CAMP COURTYARD

Co, moving stealthily in the shadow of a wall, pauses at
the SOUND of the scream.  Notes its direction.


INT.  ISOLATION CELL

In the darkness Brewer rages against the inhuman
screaming, pounding the wall.

				BREWER
		Bastards!


INT.  INTERROGATION CELL

Rambo hangs so limply that he might be dead.  Podovsk
moves in to check as Rambo's head begins to rise.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

as he looks up.  His eyes seem like diamond drills.
There is such determination born of rage in his expression
that Podovsk stops.  Takes a step back.
Snaps his fingers.

Rambo convulses and begins to scream.  Podovsk nods to his
assistant.

INSERT - PALYUSHIN'S HAND

cuts off the current.  But the scream CONTINUES.  GETS
LOUDER.

BACK TO SCENE

The Lieutenant looks up, puzzled.
Rambo is going berserk.  His body is an out-of-control
machine, lashing and tearing at the frame.  The scream
breaks and becomes a FEROCIOUS HOWL.

The Viet guard steps forward, alarmed and unnerved.
His rifle is raised, warding off evil.

Podovsk motions him back and steps closer himself.
The bedframe begins to twist, creaking and warping under
Rambo's frenzied assault.

TIGHT CUTS - RAPID SUCCESSION

A weld.  Springs pop.
Podovsk takes a reflexive step forward.
Rambo's hand shoots out, free suddenly, like a grappling
hook.
Palyushin hits the CURRENT.
Rambo jerks Podovsk into a headlock, a death embrace.
Podovsk screams.  Convulses.

				PODOVSK
			(to Palyushin)
		Nyet!  Nyet!

The Russian lashes about, convulsing in the current.

The lieutenant cuts the power.

Rambo snatches Podovsk's MAKAROV PISTOL from his holster.
Aims it at his temple before Palyushin can reach for his.
The Black Beret eases his hand away from his holster.

ON THE GUARD

Frozen.  A FIGURE slips through the door behind him.  Co
cuts his throat in one motion with a BUSH KNIFE.

She covers Palyushin with the guard's AK-47 as she circles
to Rambo who is still enmeshed in metal wreckage.
Rambo smashes the Makarov into Podovsk's temple twice,
then holds Palyushin transfixed by his pistol sights as Co
works quickly at his bonds.  There are superficial cuts on
his forearms, ankles and neck from the wire.

Rambo SCREAMS hideously and with cold premeditation to
mask the sound of her work.  The effect is bizarre,
surreal, maniacal.

				CO
			(whispering)
		We get out.  Split up.  They not
		want me.

Rambo steps from the wreckage and advances on the hulking
Black Beret, pistol ready.

Again he screams, almost a war cry now, and smashes his
fist into the Russian's face with the force of his entire
body behind it.  The big man's head ricochets off the wall
into a second piledriver punch.
Palyushin goes down.

Podovsk groans and stirs until Rambo twists the knob.
Despite a bad connection, Podovsk jerks spasmodically
under the collapsed metal frame, lying in the puddle of
water.

Before Co can use the knife on Palyushin, Capt. Vinh
enters, his expression agape.  He turns and bolts.


INT.  CORRIDOR

Vinh dashes out, SHOUTING MANIACALLY.  Behind him Rambo
hurtles through the door, a blur, and smashes Vinh against
the concrete wall.

Vaulting over the crumpled camp commander without slowing,
Rambo hits the outside door at a full run.  Just as Sgt.
Tay is opening it from outside.


EXT.  COURTYARD

Tay's AK flies from his hands as he tumbles back.
Rambo spins into him with a FLYING ROUNDHOUSE KICK which
pitches him onto his back, an inert heap.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

The transformer box shorts out under the continuous load,
frying with a bright FLASH.
The lights of the camp go out completely.


EXT.  COURTYARD

With Co close behind him, Rambo runs toward the compound
fence.

A SHOUT FROM NEARBY.  A RUNNING GUARD and Co open up with
their assault rifles simultaneously.

The guard dives for cover.
Rambo lifts the wire for Co to wiggle under.  She
reciprocates for him as the TOWER GUARD spins his long-
unused PK MACHINE GUN and opens fire.
Co fires from the shoulder.
The tower guard flinches at the unexpected return fire.
Dives.  His shots go wild.  Co's AK empties.  She drops
it.

Rambo and Co make it into the forest, running full out.
MORE AKs OPEN UP behind them.  Both TOWER PKs.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

HANDHELD PRECEDING RAMBO at a dead run as he crashes
through foliage.  The forest is an insane blur.
TRACERS WHIP BY, ruler-straight lines of red light...
deadly fireflies.

BARK EXPLODES from tree trunks around them.  Leaves are
ripped into green confetti.

They angle away from the blind firing.  Stop at a GAME
TRAIL.

				RAMBO
			(panting)
		You are amazing.

Co is furious at his dawdling.

				CO
			(pointing down trail)
		Di di mau!  Go!  Go!

She spins and sprints away along the trail, disappearing
in a moment.  Rambo hesitates an instant, then runs the
other way.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Palyushin, his nose and mouth streaming blood, claws his
way up the desk and reels across the dark room to Podovsk.
He hurls the metal frame off his superior, who groans
feebly.


EXT.  COURTYARD

A guard holds Sgt. Tay's shoulders as he retches.
Palyushin strides out of the interrogation blockhouse and
jerks the sergeant to his feet by his collar.  He points
to the forest.

				PALYUSHIN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Find!  Now!

He releases the Viet sergeant and briskly walks toward the
MIL MI-24.  Tay weakly calls orders B.G., rounding up his
guards.

The RUSSIAN PILOT is waiting dutifully near his machine as
Palyushin approaches.  The Black Beret makes a circular
hand signal... WIND HER UP.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Rambo at a dead run zig-zags along the dark game trail.

The path steepens and he claws at exposed roots...
climbing as much as running.  Behind him is the rising
sound of rotors.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR CAMP

Using HAND LIGHTS to follow his footprints, Tay's SQUAD OF
SIX GUARDS jogs into the jungle.  Behind them, through the
trees, the massive assault helicopter and its escort of
Hueys rise into the night.

The three choppers switch on their HIGH INTENSITY
SEARCHLIGHTS as they thunder overhead.
Shafts of light pierce the jungle.  Sweeping.  Searching.


EXT.  FOREST

Rambo is climbing rapidly, using roots as handholds to
ascend the steep trail.

The WHUMP-WHUMP of the helicopters approaches, the glare
of light flickering behind him.
Rambo moves into a densely woven thicket.  Freezes,
watching.  Moves on.


EXT.  FOREST - NEARBY

The guards are ascending the trail like hounds.


EXT.  FOREST - TRAIL

Rambo crashes through foliage as a SEARCHLIGHT SWEEPS
TOWARD HIM.
It races over him, backlighting him as he dives off the
trail.
The searchlight flicks past him.  Snaps back.

TRACERS rip down through the trees.
RED SLASHES OF DEATH.
Rambo tumbles, rolls, comes up running.  He tears through
the jungle in a frenzy.
The foliage is alive with blasting air.

He dives over the edge of a muddy ravine, dropping through
tangled vines.  Catching, clawing, dropping.
He runs on.
Totally manic.
They can't target him.

He hits a solid trail and sprints, really covering ground.
The shaft of light scans back and forth behind him.
Then farther away.  They've lost him.  For the moment.

ANGLE ABOVE JUNGLE CANOPY

as the choppers circle, seemingly dueling with lances of
light.


EXT.  TRAIL - NEARBY

Rambo, moving rapidly, but more carefully, glides among
the trees.  He stops at the BANK OF A TINY STREAM, setting
down knife and pistol.  Scooping stinking BLACK MUD from
the stream bed, he begins to slather it over his pale skin
with quick, sure strokes.  Arms.  Legs.  Body...

TIGHT ON RAMBO'S FACE

eyes closed, as he smears the goo thoroughly over every
exposed area.  His eyes open.  It is a neolithic, feral
visage that turns away into the foliage.

ON THE GUARDS

moving forward cautiously.  Unfamiliar with tracking, and
little else really except bullying weak prisoners, they
crash around clumsily, falling and cursing in the dense
thicket.

CLOSE ON RAMBO

moving in absolute silence nearby.  He freezes.
Fifteen meters away is a SMALL WILD PIG, asleep under a
knot of vines.  Rambo fires the makarov, hitting the earth
near the pig.  It squeals and leaps up.

THE GUARDS

wave their AKs, looking for the source of the shot.  They
hear something crashing through the undergrowth to the
right.  Movement in dense brush.  They open fire.

The CRASH OF SUSTAINED FIRE is deafening.  They blast
blindly away, lighting up the forest.
Their attention is so focused, the din so loud, they do
not notice a dark figure moving up behind them.

Rambo snatches the wayward last guard into a thicket,
knife buried to the hilt, hand over his mouth.

Tay shouts repeatedly to cease firing and the others
finally stop.

They move away, advancing on their "target."
Tay gingerly parts woven branches, revealing the pig,
riddled with hundreds of 7.62mm rounds.  He turns to the
others.

				TAY
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Where's Trang?

The other guards look around, puzzled.

ON RAMBO

A shadow in shadows.  He slips the clip from the AK-47 he
has liberated, but finds it almost empty.  Sets it down
quietly.
Tay spreads his men out to sweep the area in an arc.
The guards advance, stricken with a growing unease.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

LOW ANGLE through the trees as the Soviet assault
helicopter passes overhead, its searchlight sweeping.
The canopy of foliage lashes violently as the rotor wash
blasts through it.  Monkeys SHRIEK and leap about.

ON RAMBO - FOREGROUND

as the godlike shaft of light moves through the brush
behind him.  Searching.  Passing within a meter of him.
He moves quickly off.

The disk of hideously bright light passes over two guards,
blinding them.  One trips and goes down.  The other, the
outermost man of the sweep, waits for him to rise.  And
waits.

				GUARD
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Vuoc?  You alright?

The guard moves cautiously to his friend's last position.
Ahead face-down in a shallow stream, is the BODY OF VUOC,
his blood running away with the water.

Approaching the body warily, the guard plays his
flashlight around him in a full circle.  Nothing.

DETAIL ON MUDBANK

Featureless matted vines and mud.  Suddenly A PAIR OF EYES
SNAP OPEN.

ON THE GUARD

kneeling over Vuoc in the F.G. Behind him there is silent
movement among the gnarled roots and vines in a muddy
embankment.
Blending flawlessly with the mudbank, Rambo's mud-
encrusted figure has been in PLAIN VIEW, YET CONCEALED,
until he opened his eyes and moved.  He emerges
noiselessly and moves up behind the guard, looming above
him.


INT./ EXT.  MIL MI-24

Palyushin mans the forward cockpit, the WEAPONS BAY.
His hands clutch the handles of a machine gun as he scans
the jungle below.  The pilot directs the searchlight as he
flies.

Palyushin touches his nose gingerly.  It is clearly
broken, becoming a thickened, purplish mass.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Realizing they are without their flankers, the two CENTER
GUARDS call out and move toward their last positions.
They stand together at the top of the mudbank, gaping at
the two bodies sprawled below.

ANGLE ON TAY

isolated, calling for his men to sound off.  He hears a
distant shout, then a quick burst of gunfire.

				TAY
		Bui?  Phong?  Than?

There is no answer.


INT.  MIL MI-24

Palyushin points at something on the ground.
The pilot banks, arcing around his searchlight's target.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Tay moves forward hypnotically, as if transfixed.

The celestial shaft of the searchlight burns down ahead.
He approaches.  Like a vision he sees the BODIES OF HIS
MEN sprawled in the quivering disk of light.  One has been
stripped of his clothing.  He stares around, terrified,
staggers back, lip quivering.

Tay drops his rifle and runs back through the jungle.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - RIDGE

Rambo climbs steadily.  The mud, dissolving in sweat, runs
in streaks off his body.  He has stopped to slip on the
FATIGUE PANTS he took from one of the guards.  The pants
come to mid-calf but the material will protect against
brambles and insects.

He has also acquired an AK-47 with EXTRA MAGAZINES.
His pockets bulge with SOVIET-MADE GRENADES.

Rambo moves on into the mountains.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - DIRT ROAD

Tay stumbles out of the underbrush into a pool of light.
The headlight of a VIET ARMY TROOP TRANSPORT.

A squad of men runs past him into the jungle, fanning out.
Another truck arrives.
The search is on in force.


INT./ EXT.  FLIGHT CENTER - NAKON PHANOM AFB - DAWN

An F-4 PHANTOM JET taxis amid MOVING GROUND EQUIPMENT
under the floodlights as the sky slowly lightens.

		D-PLUS 53 HRS
		NAKON PHANOM, THAILAND

PAN OFF THE FLIGHTLINE onto Trautman gazing out the window
of a small office.  He looks haggard.  Soul-weary.
With the receiver cradled at his ear he is waiting for a
call to connect.

				TRAUTMAN
		Bob, hi.  Did you get my telex?
			(pause)
		Yeah, I know what time it is
		there... do you know what time it is
		here?  Look, is there anything you
		can do up the line?  You owe me one.
		I'm calling it in.
			(pause)
		Yes, this time.
			(pause)
		I know you're a general and I'm only
		a colonel.
			(long pause)
		So that's it, huh?  Back off.  Come
		home... that's it?
			(pause, then frostily)
		Thanks, buddy.

He slams the receiver into its cradle, and sits,
pondering.  He is about to make a somewhat bizarre
decision for a full colonel.

Trautman opens the door and the young corporal in the
office beyond turns in his chair.

				TRAUTMAN
		Get me a "Loach," I'm going back out
		to Ban Bung Kla.

				CORPORAL
		Yes, sir.


INT.  ISOLATION CELL

BLACK SCREEN.  There is a SCRAPING SOUND and light appears
as a CEMENT BLOCK is removed at floor level.  De Fravio's
face appears in the rectangular hole.

				DE FRAVIO
			(whispering)
		Hey, Brewer.  You okay?

Brewer crawls stiffly to the opening, squinting at the
glare.

				BREWER
			(hoarsely)
		I could use a beer.


EXT.  GUARD BARRACKS - CELL

The cement-block wall of the cells adjoins the raised
wooden barracks.  De Fravio and Jensen have belly-crawled
beneath the building to the cell, where they have long
used a loosened block to communicate with prisoners in
"the hole."

				DE FRAVIO
		Your buddy made it out last night.
		The place went apeshit.

				BREWER
		Really?  How come he didn't take me?

				DE FRAVIO
		Maybe because you're shot in the
		leg.

				BREWER
		Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they
		keep you in this disease hole?

				JENSEN
		Who knows?  I was in there for a
		month once.  De Fravio did three
		months.

				BREWER
		How do you keep from coming unglued?

				JENSEN
		Concentrate on a problem.  Like, I
		built my dream house in my head,
		brick by brick.  Board by board.  If
		something really takes a day, I
		thought about it for a whole day.
		Like that.

				DE FRAVIO
		I built a shopping mall.

				JENSEN
			(urgently)
		Guards.  See ya.

They slide the block into place and Brewer sits in front
of it, COUGHING TO HIDE THE SCRAPE as the door is opened
by two guards.

Morning light blasts in, blinding him, as one guard hauls
him roughly to his feet, despite his wounded leg.

				BREWER
			(menacingly)
		Watch it.  Don't fuck with me, man!
			(jerks a thumb at
			 himself)
		I'm dinky dau!

The guards guffaw and drag him off.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - MORNING

A line of Viet soldiers moves through the shimmering
jungle.

CAMERA BOOMS UP

as they move past, revealing others beyond, and the tops
of parked trucks.
The MOVE ENDS ON RAMBO, watching from the branches of a
tree as they move by only a few meters below.  The
choppers search methodically nearby.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

Brewer is trussed tightly, his elbows tied together and
drawn up painfully by a cord attached to a ceiling
fixture.
Palyushin looms in front of him, holding the truck-tire
bludgeon.

Podovsk, looking the worse for wear with a bandage
covering half his face, sits on the stool.  The gaze of
his exposed eye is malevolent.

				PODOVSK
			(wearily)
		I think you know where he is going.
		Is there a rendezvous point?  Some
		guerrilla contract?  A transmitter
		perhaps.

				BREWER
			(earnestly)
		No way.  If I say anything... that's
		three.

The interrogator scowls, briefly perplexed.

				PODOVSK
			(rising)
		I cannot be responsible for the
		safety of the prisoners if he is not
		captured.  This government now
		considers the existence of POWs an
		embarrassment.  An unmarked grave in
		the jungle may be their solution.  I
		am only an advisor.

				BREWER
		Advise my dick, you Siberian
		scumbag.

Palyushin explodes with a brutal blow to Brewer's ribs,
which doubles him over in agony.  He struggles to regain
his breath, dragging at the air like a terminal emphysema
patient.  Brewer slowly raises his head.

				BREWER
			(sneering)
		Ke-rist.  Whattaya trying to do,
		man, tickle me?

Palyushin snarls and smashes the truncheon down even
harder.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - DAY

Rambo runs crouching along a shallow gully, trying to duck
around the end of the advancing line of Viet troops.
He emerges from dense foliage onto a DIRT-TRACK SIDEROAD
only to see a FLANKING SQUAD of about ten men jogging
toward him.  They shout and hit the deck, opening fire, as
he dives on into the underbrush.

Rambo runs, zig-zagging radically as small-arms fire laces
the woods around him.  He crashes through foliage,
abandoning stealth.

LONG LENS WHIP-PANNING with Rambo as he charges down a
long slope, the trees a green blur.  He crosses his arms
over his face and batters through the brush with blind
force.


EXT.  HOOTCH

Rambo bursts out of the dense tangle, dragging streamers
of vines, and finds himself in an EXPLOSION OF SQUAWKING
CHICKENS.

He is in the muddy door-yard of a rural HOOTCH, part of a
SMALL HAMLET, of about a dozen buildings.
Pigs scatter, grunting their surprise, as Rambo sprints
across the yard.  Over a low rail fence.  Between the
hootches.

Soldiers charge down the slope behind him.


EXT.  HAMLET

Rambo emerges onto the main "street" at a dead run,
tearing a swath through the everyday village activities.

The Viet peasants scatter as the fierce American charges
through their midst.  A giant by their standards to begin
with, Rambo is now a mud-caked nightmare, trailing vines
and brambles... his face a mask of dark streaks topped by
encrusted hair.

He crashes into a panic-stricken young man on a bicycle,
spilling them both.  Rolls.  Comes up running.

Rambo changes course to intersect with an ANCIENT TRUCK
which is accelerating away, headed out of the village.
The truck, rusted and mud-caked into a brownish lump on
wheels, is hauling a load of CHICKENS in a WIRE MESH CAGE
on the flat bed.

Rambo leaps onto the running board of the cab and points
his pistol through the window at the terrified OLD MAN
driving.

				RAMBO
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Keep driving.


EXT.  ROAD

Rambo clings tightly as the truck rattles and bounces over
the rutted road, which shortly emerges from a stand of
trees to run along a field of ELEPHANT GRASS.

Rambo sees soldiers converging on the road through the
trees on the other side.  Behind him, more emerge from the
village and open fire.

A bullet shatters the filthy windshield and the old driver
loses control.  The truck veers into a ditch, slews,
hurling up a sheet of water and flops ignominiously on its
side.

Rambo lands clear.  The old man begins to sob helplessly.
The chickens scatter in all directions.

CLOSE ON RAMBO, freeing a RUSTED GAS CAN from the twisted
wreck of the truck bed.

WIDE from behind the soldiers as they pour AK-47 bursts
into the truck 50 meters away.  A figure dashes from the
now-burning vehicle into the field of tall grass,
disappearing.


EXT.  ROAD - EDGE OF GRASS

Two troop trucks are deploying soldiers as a group of
OFFICERS stands near the chicken truck.  Sgt. Tay climbs
down from a six-by cab.  Directing operations is Capt.
Vinh.  His face is bruised and abraded, and one arm is on
a sling.

Vinh motions Tay impatiently toward where he stands at the
edge of the elephant grass, and Tay wades into it, joining
him.  Beyond them the coarse grass becomes an impenetrable
wall almost EIGHT FEET HIGH.

Vinh snorts in disgust at Tay and points at some trampled
stalks.  There is a bright smear of blood, and beyond,
another.  Vinh cuffs his sergeant.

				VINH
			(Viet/subtitled)
		You see?  Not a demon.  A man.  Now,
		we find where he's crawled to die.

Tay indicates that the others should go ahead of him, to
have that honor.

A line of THIRTY REGULARS moves into the grass.  Only the
RADIO ANTENNAS of the squad leaders are visible above the
waving stalks.  The helicopters arc in from the distant
ridgeline, converging.


EXT.  ELEPHANT GRASS

POV, HANDHELD, MOVING SLOWLY THROUGH THE GRASS.  The point
man parts the stalks ahead.  It is a quiet, eerie world,
with only the SWISH OF THE GRASS and the occasional SOUND-
OFF CALLS of the troopers.  There is a clear trail of
blood smeared on the grass, indicating a serious wound.

VARIOUS CLOSEUPS of the regulars as they advance, each man
realizing how utterly isolated he really is, in his own
island of space in the green sea.  It is hot.  Some of the
soldiers have their fatigues unbuttoned, sleeves rolled
up.  Sweat pours off them.

POV, HANDHELD, following the trail of blood.  The grass is
parted ahead and a small clearing comes into view.
Slowly moving up on SOMETHING LYING IN THE GRASS.
TWO CHICKENS, THEIR THROATS CUT, are lying beside the gas
can, which is upright with its cap off.  A bizarre little
shrine.  There is no sign of Rambo.

REVERSE on the squad leader, puzzled, wary.

INSERT - RAMBO'S HAND strikes a match, igniting a wet
trail of SPILLED GAS with a WHOOSH.

The squad leader looks up, seeing the river of fire
snaking toward him through the waving stalks.

He turns, panicked.  Crashes into the men behind him.

Shrieks at them to move.  They trample over each other to
run as the trail of fire reaches the can.

VOOM!

Tay sees a tremendous fireball erupt ahead.  Hears
SCREAMING.  He freezes in his tracks as the nightmare
begins again.  Shrieking, a man runs toward him, ON FIRE,
charging past.

Vinh shouts futilely into a radio.  Firing blindly,
several troopers open up.


EXT.  ROAD

From the trucks it is apparent that the grass is burning
on its own, in a long line where the "fuse" was laid out
and in a widening circle around the explosion site.


EXT.  IN THE GRASS

Black smoke rolls through the grass, and troopers stumble
about, coughing as the wind carries it toward them.

The choppers have moved in close overhead and their rotor-
wash fans the fire, adding to the confusion.

FAST HANDHELD PRECEDING RAMBO

as he snakes rapidly through the stalks.  He stops.  Hurls
a grenade.  Runs on, navigating by instinct in the dense
smoke.

VINH

is knocked down as a grenade detonates near him.

A trooper helps him up, sees a figure running nearby...
fires.  Hitting one of their own.
More grenades.  Random firing.  The din is incredible, the
pandemonium absolute.

A VIET SOLDIER, reels through the grass.  Obviously a
recent conscript, the soldier is probably only 18 years
old, and like all Vietnamese, looks even younger.  He is
terrified.

He stumbles over the body of another trooper.  As he
rises, a shape slashes through the grass right in front of
him.
He has never seen an American, but it looks as monstrous
as the descriptions.

He raises his AK but Rambo is quicker, kicking it out of
his hands.  The kid flops on his butt and finds himself
staring up Rambo's rifle barrel.  He closes his eyes and
pops into his mouth his BUDDHIST PRAYER MEDALLION, hanging
from a chain around his neck.  He bites down and waits for
oblivion.

When he opens his eyes there is nothing in front of him
but grass.

Nearby, Vinh leads the retreat as his men fall back, dim
shapes rushing blindly through the murk.
He staggers, coughing, out of the stand of grass to see
Tay, sitting dazed nearby.  Tay gives him an evil smirk.

Barking orders like a maniac, Vinh calls for MORTARS to be
set up.  Five mortars are positioned.  Elevation set.
Mortar bombs poised above the launch tubes.  The
helicopters clear off.

When the last wounded man is dragged clear, Vinh signals
for a sighting round.
It EXPLODES beyond the wall of flame.  The mortars open
fire.

The field explodes seconds later with the first salvo.
Earth and shredded grass are hurled skyward.  A second
salvo lands.  A third.  And on and on, pulverizing the
entire area.


EXT.  TREELINE - NEARBY

Rambo watches, fascinated by the tremendous destruction
unleashed on innocent acreage nearby.

He slips slowly into the woods, glancing back frequently
at his trail.  He stops occasionally to replace a
disturbed twig or leaf, or to rearrange branches when he
passes through.  Total "sterilization."
The mortars thud on distantly as he creeps away.


INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

FULL SHOT as Palyushin delivers a crippling blow to
Brewer's ribs.  Brewer cries out hoarsely and slumps.

CLOSE ON BREWER as his head slowly rises to look at the
big Russian.

				BREWER
			(panting)
		This your first day?

Podovsk catches his assistant's hand before he swings.

				PODOVSK
		You think you can provoke us into
		beating you unconscious?  We are not
		that... unskilled.

				BREWER
		I've had it with you, ratface.
		Don't piss me off!

Podovsk takes the "fan belt" from Palyushin and smashes it
across Brewer's face.  Again.  Brewer scream hideously.
And again.

CLOSE ON BREWER

We see only the top of his head.  We don't want him to
rise up, but he does, agonizingly.  Blood streams over the
area where his eye is already swelling shut.
Don't say anything, Brewer.

				BREWER
			(hoarsely)
		Aaargh.  God damn that... was...
		good!
			(shouting)
		Do it again, you fuck!
			(screaming)
		Come on... I love it!  You hear
		me... I LOVE IT!

Podovsk looms before us, swinging in slow motion, INTO THE
LENS.  The scene FADES OUT.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - DAY

Under overcast sky Rambo emerges at a steep-walled ravine.
There is a swaying SUSPENSION BRIDGE of rope and woven
vines crossing to the jungled slope beyond.

Looming at the top of that slope is the ruin of the Wat on
its plateau, wreathed in streamers of blowing mist.

Not far away is the waterfall, pouring itself into the
gorge below.

Rambo stops at the far side of the bridge, examining the
vine-cables.
He starts pulling grenades out of his pockets.


EXT.  PRISON CAMP - DAY

Palyushin crosses the compound to the Huey gunship which
has just touched down.  The other Huey hovers above the
trees B.G.

The big Russian appreciatively pats the MINIGUN bolted in
the main door as he climbs in.
Palyushin enters the cockpit, motioning for the VIETNAMESE
PILOT to take off as he slips a headset over his black
beret.
The ship rises, and the two Hueys bank across the jungle.


INT.  MOTC - THAILAND

		D-PLUS 58 HRS

The telecom tech turns as Kirkhill enters.

				TECH
			(handing him a sheaf
			 of papers)
		More AWACS intercepts.  The Russian
		takes time to translate.

Kirkhill scans a long PRINTOUT TRANSCRIPT.

				KIRKHILL
		He's giving them a run for their
		money.  Says here they've got two
		Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know
		those dinks had Hueys.

				TECH
		Half their air force is our stuff.
		Captured.

				KIRKHILL
		Typical...

				TECH
		Sir, there's something else... a
		TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.

				KIRKHILL
		What?

He snatches the sheet from the tech.

E.C.U. - PRINTOUT SHEET

It reads:

		KIRKHILL/I'M COMING FOR YOU/RAMBO

KIRKHILL

stares at the sheet for a long time.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR WAT - DAY

Rambo finishes dismantling the TRANSAT unit.  He sets the
pieces back into the hole of the CACHE he and Brewer
buried before their run through the jungle.

He begins shoveling earth back into the hole.
A beautiful PURPLE MOTH-ORCHID drops onto the ground by
his hand.  He freezes.

				VOICE
		You not so hard to catch, dinky dau
		Rambo.

Rambo looks up along the tumbled stone wall.  Sitting near
the top in shadow, perched on a tree limb, is Co, beaming
like a Cheshire cat.

				RAMBO
			(relaxing)
		Christ.  How'd you get here?

				CO
			(climbing down)
		Took bus, most of way.  I knew you
		would come here.

He helps her down the last few feet, and stands looking at
her, marveling.

				RAMBO
		And how'd you sneak up like that?

				CO
		Carefully.  Don't want to get shot
		by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you
		need me.

				RAMBO
		I do?

				CO
		You think you are... (she uses a
		Viet word).

				RAMBO
			(translating)
		Invulnerable.

				CO
		In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass
		kicked without me.

Rambo has to laugh.

				RAMBO
		Yeah.  We're a pretty good team.

Co looks him over carefully.  She touches his forehead.

				CO
		You look like hell.  Wounds
		infected.  Come up to the ruins, I
		have medical kit.

Rambo lets her lead him to the path up the hill.


EXT.  RUINS OF WAT

The stone Buddhas look on complacently as Co attends to
Rambo's minor wounds.  During the ensuing conversation she
cleans, applies salve and bandages the wire-lacerations
and the numerous slashes from brambles and saw-edged
elephant grass.

				CO
		You try get across Laos?  Get to
		Thailand?

				RAMBO
			(nodding)
		Yeah.  Got some business there.
		What are you gonna do?

				CO
			(shrugs)
		Go United States.  See Nguyen.
		Maybe teach economics.  Buy
		Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."

				RAMBO
		How you going to get there?  You
		can't trust the spooks to pull you
		out.  They'll use you up and throw
		you away.

				CO
		I know.  I go with you.

				RAMBO
		I couldn't get you in.

Co stops her work and replies very quietly.

				CO
		Yes you can.

				RAMBO
		How?

Co's gaze holds his and her Cheshire grin flickers.

				CO
		As wife.

Rambo realizes she is serious.  The silence drags when he
realizes how good that sounds to him at this moment.  And
how small a price that is to repay her.

				RAMBO
			(with finality)
		Okay.  Done.  You got it.

She seems a bit shocked, then smiles impishly.

				CO
		You too easy.

Co's hands have been all over him but only now does he
become aware of them on his shoulders.

She draws her face up to his but Rambo pulls back from the
kiss.  Co looks puzzled as he slowly disengages from her
contact.

				CO
		You don't feel love, Rambo?

He leans back against the wall.

				RAMBO
		Look, Co...

				CO
		Why you don't feel love?  Not
		allowed?
			(her tone becomes
			 aggressive)
		Dead inside, maybe?  You make
		yourself dead already so they can't
		kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!

She advances on him until her face is close to his, her
words finding their mark.

				CO
			(continuing)
		Bucu bullshit!
			(pause)
		I have enough death already.
		Husband.  Mother.  Father.
		Brothers.  Death everywhere.

She points into the undergrowth nearby, to a ghostly
blossom growing there among the tangled vines.

				CO
		You see?  A flower like that need
		good soil to grow.  Many time under
		earth is bones of animal... or
		person.  Killed in jungle.  Make
		soil rich.  Grows most beautiful
		flower.  You call orchid.  Many
		deaths in jungle.  Vietnamese, V.C.,
		American.  Many beautiful flowers.

Rambo studies her intently.  An emotional moment for him.
He takes her flawless face in his hands, draws her closer.

Suddenly his head snaps around.  A distant THUDDING of
COPTER ROTORS becomes audible, growing slowly louder.

Rambo leaps up, sprinting to a crumbled parapet.
Below, in the valley, the two Hueys are slowly scanning,
like angry insects.


EXT.  SUSPENSION BRIDGE

A COLUMN of VIET SOLDIERS jogs across the swaying bridge.

ANGLE PAST AN OBJECT IN F.G.

as the lead man approaches, almost across the bridge.  The
object is a CLUSTER OF GRENADES lashed to a tree to which
one of the main support cables of the bridge is attached.

A FINE WIRE runs down to the bridge walkway.

PING.  The wire pulls a pin.


EXT.  WAT RUINS

Rambo whips around as an explosion rips through the
jungle.


EXT.  BRIDGE

The bridge begins to collapse, dumping half the soldiers
into the ravine as one side drops.  The others run back.
The second cable tears away.  The bridge swings down,
spilling the remaining men.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - TREETOP LEVEL

The two Hueys bank steeply and ROAR straight TOWARD
CAMERA, passing overhead.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST - NEAR WAT

Rambo and Co head into a trail which leads down the
backside of the plateau.  Rushing toward them is a PLATOON
of VIET REGULARS.

Rambo opens fire, scattering them off the trail.
He and Co make it back to the Wat as return fire rips
through the jungle.

Rambo throws two grenades down the hill and sprints with
Co deeper into the maze of the ruined monastery.

The soldiers fall back as the grenades detonate ahead of
them.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin speaks into his helmet radio.

				PALYUSHIN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Get your men back.  I'm beginning an
		attack run.

The Huey THUNDERS toward the ruins, banking in an arc to
aim the "minigun."


EXT.  RUINS

Rambo sees the Huey coming in on a high arcing trajectory
and knows he's in trouble.  Dragging Co, he dives under a
section of wall which has collapsed like a lean-to.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin's thumb depresses the FIRE CONTROL SWITCH.

An AWESOME ROAR fills the sky.  A COLUMN OF ORANGE FIRE
blasts from the minigun as its gatling-gun barrels rotate
in a blur.

One of the most ferocious anti-personnel weapons used in
the Vietnam war, the GENERAL ELECTRIC M-134 Minigun fires
six thousand 7.62mm rounds per minute.  Since every fifth
round is a tracer, the impression is of a solid shaft of
fire sustained between ship to ground.

The SOUND is not that of a machine gun but rather a SOLID
HELD NOTE OF THUNDER, like a god belching.
One of its nicknames was "Puff the Magic Dragon."


EXT.  RUINS

The effect on the ground is unbelievable.  Trees are blown
to kindling.  The foliage is pulverized, and blown upward
like mist.

The tracers hit the ground like an orange curtain
stripping the stones of growth, blasting up a cloud of
emulsified jungle.

In their crevice, Rambo and Co huddle, covering their
ears.
A fusillade of chips and splinters whips around them.

Suddenly, the thunder cuts off.

Rambo rolls out.  Fires well-aimed bursts at the
retreating Huey.


INT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin hears rounds whacking the underside of the ship.
He calmly orders the pilot to turn back.


EXT.  RUINS - CREVICE

Rambo crouches in the opening, watching the ship bank.

				CO
			(terrified)
		What was that?

				RAMBO
		Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move.
		He's coming in on our open side.

They sprint across the courtyard as the minigun ROARS
again.  The CURTAIN OF DEVASTATION sweeps toward them as
they run.  They make it behind one of the Buddhas, just as
the hail of death passes across it.
The rounds blast a layer of weathered stone off the serene
face.

Behind Rambo the second Huey pops above the trees, firing
with a conventional door gun, an M-60.
Rambo fires back.
Tracers flash around him.  He reloads.  FIRES.

CO CRIES OUT.  She is SLAMMED AGAINST THE WALL.
The second Huey banks away.  Rambo crouches beside Co's
crumpled figure.


INT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin turns to the pilot.

				PALYUSHIN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Return to staging area.  We have to
		reload.


EXT.  RUINS

Rambo cradles Co, whose blouse is drenched with blood.
It runs over his hands as he holds her helplessly.

She is as white as the jungle orchid.  Her eyes focus
slowly on Rambo.

				CO
			(almost inaudible)
		Dinky-dau-Rambo.

Rambo is rocking her, willing the life to stay in her, his
expression anguished.

				RAMBO
		John.  My name is John.

				CO
			(very weak)
		It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it
		hurt?


INT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin coordinates the air operation.

				PALYUSHIN
			(Viet/subtitled)
		Air Two, circle in a holding
		pattern.
			(Russian/subtitled)
		Air Three, are you in position?


INT./ EXT.  MIL MI-24

In the spacious MAIN COCKPIT which overlooks the lower
WEAPONS BAY blister, PODOVSK is seated with the Russian
pilot.

				PILOT
			(Russian/subtitled)
		Ready, Air Command.

				PALYUSHIN (V.O.)
			(Russian/subtitled)
		Begin your run.

The pilot turns to Podovsk.

				PILOT
			(Russian/subtitled)
		How many are down there?

				PODOVSK
			(distantly)
		One.

The pilot looks at him strangely.  The massive assault
helicopter noses down and thunders forward across the
jungle.


EXT.  RUINS

VERY CLOSE ON RAMBO, rocking gently.

				RAMBO
		... you're gonna love it there.
		It'll be great.  We can do what we
		want... you and me... go to the
		beach... with Nguyen... watch him
		ridin' his surfboard...

Co's eyes are glazed, half-open.  She is gone.

Rambo sobs.  Somehow this one tragedy renders all the
others pale.

				RAMBO
			(continuing)
		Oh, God...

He kisses her mouth fiercely.  Trying to make her live, to
infuse her cooling flesh with some of his vast will.


INT.  MIL MI-24

				PILOT
			(Russian/subtitled)
		500 meters.  Final approach.


EXT.  RUINS

Rambo lays Co with infinite gentleness in the lap of the
stone Buddha.  In the lap is one slightly cupped hand,
palm upward, stripped of foliage by the minigun.
Co lies in the palm, barely filling it.

Single sniping rounds WHACK occasionally near Rambo.
He is oblivious.

Rambo removes the tiny BUDDHIST PRAYER MEDALLION from
around her neck and puts it on.  Straightens her clothing.
Looks up at the broad stone countenance.

Its expression is, as always, enigmatic.

He turns as the assault chopper approaches, running dead
at him.

TWO LONG METAL CYLINDERS detach from the stub wings and
drop, beginning their characteristic TUMBLING.

				RAMBO
			(awed)
		'Palm.

He spins and runs, leaving his rifle.


EXT.  RAIN FOREST

Rambo slashes through the trees like a madman, running
with everything he has.

Behind him the NAPALM CANISTERS hit the ground at the edge
of the ruins.

An ENORMOUS FIREBALL blossoms through the jungle.
The canisters' inertia carries them forward, SPEWING
TWENTY-METER-LONG ARCS OF FLAME.  The inferno engulfs the
Buddhas and rolls forward through the trees, silhouetting
the tiny running figure of Rambo.

Just as the firestorm reaches him he dives at a dead run
off an embankment.  Into a rushing MOUNTAIN STREAM about
five meters wide.

UNDERWATER SEQUENCE

Rambo dives to the bottom as a sun-bright CANOPY OF FIRE
rushes across the surface with a muffled ROAR.

The stream is only about two meters deep and is swiftly
flowing.  The napalm on the surface lights the bottom
orange despite the daylight.  He seems suspended in a
fiery maelstrom.

MOVING WITH RAMBO'S figure we dive at giddy speed over the
tortuous streambed like some weird amusement park ride.
Rambo tumbles over and between smooth boulders.

He strains to hold his breath as the fire diminishes
above.
Then it is gone.  He is clear.

Suddenly the rocks END, dropping away.


EXT.  RAVINE - WATERFALL

Rambo tumbles clear of the falling water as he drops down
the face of the CATARACT seen earlier.

He hits the surface of the pool with a tremendous SPLASH.

ANGLE ON WATER

boiling with turbulence as he surfaces, gasping.
He weakly sculls at the surface as the current carries him
along.

Above, on the escarpment, a FIRE-STORM rages, lighting up
the jungle.

The Buddha is at the heart of the holocaust, reminiscent
of a self-immolating monk.  Co's pyre is magnificent.


EXT.  BRACKISH ESTUARY

The pool at the base of the cataract empties into
swampland near the Ca River.
Rambo lets the increasingly torpid flow carry him until he
catches sight of a familiar object: The abandoned sampan
of the river bandits, still moored among the huge tree
roots.


EXT.  SWAMP - SAMPAN

Rambo clambers aboard and goes into the cabin.
Still in its wooden locker is the RPG-7 ROCKET GRENADE
LAUNCHER and a rack of ROCKETS in a carrying pack.
With rapid movements Rambo dons the pack and picks up the
launcher.  Moves to the stern.  Pulls hard on the starter
rope of the filthy outboard.

Across the estuary one of the Hueys is moving over the
trees, getting closer.  The motor starts on the third
pull.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY TWO

The VIET PILOT banks, motioning to his door gunner.  Below
them is the sampan, chugging across the estuary.

The pilot descends as the gunner opens fire.  The .30
caliber slugs riddle the sampan, sending splinters flying.

It EXPLODES, its incredible hoard of junk hurled flaming
into the swamp.

The Huey lowers farther, rotorwash whipping the water into
churning froth.

The Viets scan the debris, spotting a FLOATING BODY.

ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL

as the corpse rolls slowly over.  It is Kinh, the crazy
bandit leader.


EXT.  MARSH - NEARBY

WATER LEVEL.  The Huey, hovering 40 meters away, begins to
turn toward us.

SOMETHING RISES from the surface scum in CLOSE F.G. among
the gnarled tree roots.
A HULKING FIGURE dripping water and mud and strands of
swamp weed.

Rambo.

The launcher tube across his shoulder.

REVERSE - CLOSE ON RAMBO

as he wipes filthy water out of his eyes and returns to
the SCOPE-SIGHT, blinking, taking his time.

WIDER

The Huey's M-60 opens up, walking a parade of waterspouts
toward him across the water.

Rambo FIRES.
With a tremendous BACKBLAST the rocket leaps out, a fiery
arrow, and strikes the Huey square in the canopy.

FLASH!  CRACK!  The Huey drops into the swamp, its rotors
twisting up and flying off.  The FUEL TANKS EXPLODE.

Rambo pivots, reloading.  He takes aim and fires again.
The rocket roars into the rain forest, the blast sending
approaching soldiers scattering.

He reloads.  Fires again, flinching away from the rocket
exhaust.  His expression is grim, his movements
methodical.
He pivots again.  Fires.
Rounds start hitting around him.  He holds position.
Reloads.
Fires.

Beyond the trees, off the river road, the troop trucks are
parked.  Nearby is a REFUELING TRUCK for the helicopters.
Rambo's rocket makes a direct hit.
A FIREBALL BLASTS UP AND OUT, seeming to fill the jungle.


INT.  HUEY ONE

Palyushin sees the smoke rising from the carnage ahead as
he returns with the minigun reloaded.
He motions the pilot to hover over the partially submerged
wreckage of the other Huey.


EXT.  SWAMP

WHIP PANNING with Rambo as he sprints along the horizontal
trunk of a fallen tree.
He vaults off the end.
Catches a skid of the hovering Huey with one hand.

Palyushin's door gunner swings his sling-mounted "free 60"
around to bear.  Too late.
Rambo's hand shoots up, catches him, pulls him out.


INT.  HUEY

The pilot feels the weight shift and looks back, seeing
Rambo on the skid.  He "pulls pitch" hard.
The Huey climbs, arcing radically.


EXT.  HUEY

Rambo slips, dangles.
He crashes through the upper branches of a tree as the
Huey climbs, banking in a tight arc.
The rain forest rolls beneath his dangling legs.
He heaves himself up.


INT.  HUEY

Palyushin lurches out of his seat.
He spins in time to see a filthy, bloody and very intense-
looking Rambo clambering in the gun door.

He rushes Rambo with a kick but Rambo ducks and swings the
M-60 door gun on its mount, blocking the Russian.
The two lock eyes and square off, crouching in the low
compartment.

The pilot turns around and gapes in amazement, allowing
the craft to sideslip.

Palyushin lunges as the Huey pitches wildly.
Rambo blocks in a sweeping SHAO-LIN CHUN ROUNDHOUSE,
ending in a fierce hammer punch to Palyushin's face.
They trade blows and blocks furiously, finally grappling
like wrestlers.

They crash together into the wall by the minigun AMMO
CANISTER.  The Huey yaws and recovers.  Open space roars
outside as they strain near the doors, trying desperately
to maintain footing on the pitching floor.

Palyushin goes half out the door but clings tenaciously,
surging back inside.
He hammers into Rambo, slamming him mercilessly back.
A vicious kick drops Rambo.  The Black Beret grabs his
hair and HURLS HIM TWO-HANDED TOWARD THE DOOR.

Rambo desperately catches the handles of the door gun,
stopping his plunge into space.  His weight swings the gun
around in its sling, pointing it into the ship.

Completely outside the helicopter, Rambo hangs from the
handle with one hand.  Pulls the bolt with the other.

And drills a long burst into Palyushin at point blank
range, blasting him out the far door in an explosive spray
of blood.

The pilot turns, terrified, as Rambo advances on him.
Rambo eases up beside him, slipping his hand onto the
COLLECTIVE STICK.

Reaching across he opens the pilot's door.  And FLINGS HIM
OUT!


EXT.  MARSH

A figure tumbles from the low-flying Huey and splashes
into the estuary.  The Huey dips and bucks, then rights
itself and flies off as the pilot surfaces, gasping.

							 CUT TO:

INT.  MOTC - THAILAND

Kirkhill looks like he hasn't slept in days as he stirs
his ten thousandth cup of machine coffee.

				KIRKHILL
		Well, have they got him yet?

The tech rereads the COMINT transcript.

				TECH
		Um... actually, no.  It looks like
		he shot down one of their

				KIRKHILL
		Christ almighty.

				TECH
		... and then he, uh... took the

				KIRKHILL
			(exploding)
		What?

Kirkhill sinks slowly into a chair.


EXT.  PRISON CAMP - VIETNAM - AFTERNOON

Sgt. Tay is sitting on the steps of the guard barracks,
looking a bit like a lost soul.
The sound of a rotor gets louder.

A shadow falls upon him.  He looks up squinting.

A shape, an outline... in the glare of the sun.
Tay has a moment of apprehension.
Then...


EXT.  RAMBO'S HUEY

Rambo unleashes the minigun.  The left guard tower
VANISHES IN A CLOUD OF FALLING SPLINTERS as thunder rolls
across the valley.

The Huey pivots nimbly.  The minigun roars again.
An orange lightning bolt vaporizes the right tower.

VARIOUS ANGLES IN CAMP

as the thunder fades.

Tay starts to run.
The prisoners dive for cover.

Three off-duty guards in the guards barracks go for their
rifles.
They don't make it.

FROM RAMBO'S POV

The guards barracks seems to disintegrate as the minigun
sweeps across it... a SHOCK WAVE OF DESTRUCTION behind
which only flying kindling remains.

He pivots a last time and annihilates the sentry post with
a one-second burst.  Three guards have managed to take
cover behind a truck by the main gate.  They begin firing.

LOW ANGLE ON THE HUEY, a roaring silhouette in the
metallic mist.  The minigun speaks.

The truck is ripped open like aluminum foil, shrapnel
flying.  The guards CEASE TO EXIST.

A spray of red mist and tattered scraps of uniforms
settles to the ground.

It is all over in seconds.

The Huey settles to earth in the center of the compound.
Tay, crouching, squints against the rotor blast.
Wild-eyed, Capt. Vinh steps from his partially collapsed
office and raises his side-arm pistol.

Tay snatches it from him with a terrified cry and an
expression which says: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

The Sgt. flings the pistol away and turns toward the
Huey.

Out of the boiling, blasting dust and smoke a FIGURE
EMERGES.

To Tay, Rambo is Death incarnate.

He is encrusted with dried mud, dried blood, streaked with
rivulets of sweat.  His eyes burn.

Rambo has detached the door gun from its sling and, with
the feed belt over one shoulder, carries it like a rifle.

He motions with the muzzle.  Tay and Vinh flop forward,
face to the earth, hands laced behind their heads.

Rambo moves past them, eyeing the wreckage of the camp
warily.


INT.  ISOLATION CELL

Darkness.
The door is kicked open and Rambo is there, silhouetted.

Brewer is a sorry mess, but alive.  He raises his head,
blinking.

				BREWER
		Gawd, you look awful.

				RAMBO
		You comin'?

				BREWER
			(trying to rise)
		Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a
		hand.

Rambo helps Brewer, who is nearly crippled with pain, to
his feet, and supports him as they exit.


EXT.  CAMP COURTYARD

The seven prisoners are helping one another into the
copter as Rambo and Brewer hobble up.

				RAMBO
		Can you handle the door gun?

				BREWER
		Duck soup.

Tay and Vinh are still face-down and De Fravio covers them
with an AK-47, found in the rubble.

Smoke swirls in the idling rotor wash as the barracks
begins to burn.

				DE FRAVIO
		Am I dreaming this?  This is not
		real, right?
			(to guards)
		I oughta grease you pricks, but I've
		known you too long.

				RAMBO
		Let's go, De Fravio.  Move it!

When De Fravio is aboard, crammed in with the others in
the main bay, Rambo remounts the M-60 and jumps into the
pilot's seat.

He brings up the RPMs.
The TURBINE WHINE INCREASES.

Brewer, crouched behind Rambo, yells forward.

				BREWER
		We got company.  You better pull
		some pitch, buddy.

Behind them, diving out of the sun's glare, is Podovsk's
massive assault helicopter.

Rambo pops the Huey off the ground and runs hard at the
treeline.

The MIL MI-24 NOSEGUN begins firing and the ground erupts
behind the Huey, fountains of earth chasing it as it
climbs out.

At full climb the laden Huey barely clears the trees and
Rambo Immediately banks tight to get out of the nosegun's
field of fire.

The Soviet chopper tightens its arc, but swings wide, and
Rambo spirals back.
Brewer swings the door gun and gets off a long burst as
the ground reels dizzyingly below and the horizon tilts.

				RAMBO
			(shouting)
		Brewer!  You know what that thing's
		packing?

				BREWER
		It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably
		has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking
		rockets and wire guided missiles,
		plus...

				RAMBO
		Forget it.

Rambo noses the Huey down, building speed.  Tail high, it
shoots across the treetops, its NOSE RADIO ANTENNA ripping
through the uppermost foliage.

THE SOVIET COPTER

rolls on its side in a tight turn, despite its bulk.

Twice the size and power of the Huey, and faster at the
top end, the high-performance assault ship is a formidable
opponent.  But Rambo pits skill against technology, using
the agility of his craft as his primary strategy.

ANGLE BACK

past the dodging Huey as the Soviet ship falls in behind,
steadily gaining.

PAST BREWER

who flinches as trees rush by seemingly inches away at 120
MPH.  The POWs are flung against the bulkheads as the Huey
plummets and swerves.

				DE FRAVIO
		I think I'm gonna be sick.


INT.  SOVIET COPTER - COCKPIT AND WEAPONS BAY

The pilot turns to Podovsk.

				PILOT
			(Russian/subtitled)
		They're approaching the border.
		Should we notify the Laotian Air
		Force?

				PODOVSK
			(driven)
		No.  We'll take them ourselves.

Inside the COMPUTERIZED WEAPONS BAY the GUNNER hunches
over his TRACKING SCREEN.  Rambo's Huey is a shimmering
blob weaving behind a targeting reticle.

The RANGING RADAR emits a rhythmic PINGING which INCREASES
in frequency.


EXT.  SOVIET COPTER

TWO AIR-TO-AIR ROCKETS flash from support pylons on the
stub wings and roar toward the Huey two hundred meters
ahead.

ANGLE ON HUEY

as the rockets skim past, missing only barely, to explode
in the jungle.

OVER RAMBO'S SHOULDER

through the front canopy, as the Huey flies through the
rising fireballs.

Rambo sees what he needs, a narrow river, a tributary of
the Ca, slicing through the rain forest.

The Soviet juggernaut is gaining as Rambo dives his
gunship "onto the deck," tearing down through an opening
in the trees and skimming over the surface of the river.
The Soviet craft can't follow.

The enormous trees form a canyon, the walls of which
overhang the river.  Rambo is actually zig-zagging beneath
the jungle canopy in places.  They flash in and out of
dense shadows.

The landing skids throw up spurts of muddy water as the
Huey banks.  Two more rockets arrow toward them.  One
explodes in a tree above.  The other flashes past.  Hits
the river ahead.  They fly through a wall of spray.

Brewer gives his REBEL YELL.

				BREWER
		Hell.  This is just like fucking
		Star Wars, man!

				DE FRAVIO
			(puzzled)
		Star Wars?

Brewer grins, realizing.  Slaps him on the shoulder.

				BREWER
		You're gonna love it.

				RAMBO
			(shouting)
		How much we got left in that
		minigun?

Brewer opens the enormous ammunition canister.

				BREWER
		Pretty low.  Couple of seconds
		worth.

Rambo is plugged into some insane second sight, knowing
the curves before they curve.  He flies with absolute
concentration.


INT.  SOVIET COCKPIT

The pilot is sweating, trying to stay on Rambo's Huey.

				PILOT
		We're in Laos, Sir.

				PODOVSK
		I know that!
			(to gunner)
		Fire all your rockets.  Take him
		down!


INT./ EXT.  HUEY

As the forest explodes around them.  The chopper is
buffeted.  The forward canopy is shattered by shrapnel.
Rambo is hit in the shoulder and chest.
His left arm broken above the elbow.
One of the prisoners is moaning, holding his bloody
forehead.

Rambo pulls up on the collective, sending blinding pain
through his arm.  The Huey shoots up out of the jungle,
spinning as it pops up.
It slips sideways through the air, seemingly going out of
control.
Then it arcs back, ROARING RIGHT AT THE CAMERA.


INT.  SOVIET COCKPIT

Podovsk watches Rambo's turn, realizing he has stood to
fight.

				PODOVSK
			(Russian/subtitled)
		We've got him.

The pilot stares apprehensively as the Huey comes at them.

In the weapons bay, the tone of the ranging-radar rises to
a shriek.  The gunner tenses to fire.


EXT.  HUEY

Rambo throws the gunship sideways and climbs in one
motion... bringing the minigun to bear.

He is a samurai and the Huey his sword.

TIGHT ON RAMBO

facing the Soviet leviathan, clear-eyed, in the Void Way,
as they say.
It will be a battle of one stroke.  He waits.  Feeling his
breathing.  Feeling the ship like an extension of himself.

ANGLE

The minigun BLAST FORTH ITS STREAM OF FIRE.

ON RAMBO

watching.  A shadow passes over him.

WIDE

as the Soviet ship thunders over them and flies on.

ANGLE

The barrels of the minigun continue to rotate, dry-
firing... empty.  Clicking like an air-ratchet.

ANGLE ON SOVIET COPTER

showing the riddled, glassless cockpit... the slumped
bodies.

WIDE

as the MIL MI-24 slowly brodies sideways and drops,
gracefully, into the rain forest.

It shears through trees, breaking up, and EXPLODES
GLORIOUSLY.


INT.  HUEY

Rambo is tensed, like a thousand volts are flowing through
him.  Slowly, he relaxes.  He knows they have made it.

				BREWER
			(exultant)
		The thrill of victory, the agony of
		defeat!

Rambo banks the Huey, ascending toward the mountain pass
and, beyond, Thailand.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  STAGING AREA - THAILAND - DAY

Lifer lounges in the gun door of the "Blackhawk" as the
ship sits at ready, turbine idling.

				TRAUTMAN (O.S.)
		Getting ready to go somewhere?

Lifer turns to see Trautman step around the fuselage of
the chopper.

				LIFER
		Hey, Colonel.  You're not cleared to
		be on this base anymore.

CLOSE ON TRAUTMAN

				TRAUTMAN
			(quietly)
		I know.

							 CUT TO:

EXT.  LAOS - NEAR MEKONG RIVER - DUSK

		D-PLUS 60 HRS

The battered Huey lumbers and dips over the terrain,
barely in control.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY

Rambo seems drained of color, sunken into the seat, flying
on nerve.

Several of the prisoners are asleep.  The wounded man's
forehead has been bandaged.
Brewer is holding court.

				BREWER
		... and there's this guy with a
		black helmet and cape, right, and
		he's got this sword... except it's
		not a sword, it's light...

				DE FRAVIO
		There's the Mekong.

They look forward as a broad river appears beyond a ridge-
line less than a kilometer ahead.  The Thai border.  A
cheer goes up.  A home run.

ON RAMBO

seeing something as they approach the river.


EXT.  MEKONG - TREELINE

The BLACK SIKORSKY rises slowly above the trees directly
ahead.


INT.  HUEY

C.U. RAMBO, he blinks, trying to clear his vision which
has become light and shimmery.
The hovering ship looks like the Archangel of Death.
It seems like a vision.  He flies straight toward it.


INT.  MOTC

Kirkhill has cleared the operations center.  He is alone.

				KIRKHILL
			(to mike)
		When the unidentified helicopter has
		crossed the river into Thailand,
		shoot it down with air-to-air
		rockets.  Then proceed to the crash
		site and fire your remaining rockets
		into the wreckage.  Is this
		understood, Zen Hammer?

				DOYLE (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Ah, Sir... I'm experiencing a little
		hearing problem.

				KIRKHILL
		What are you talking about?  Why?

				DOYLE (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Well, uh... I've got something in my
		ear.


INT./ EXT.  SIKORSKY

What Doyle has in his ear is the muzzle of Colonel
Trautman's M-16.

Behind them on the deck of the gun bay Lifer is out cold.
A tarpaulin among a stack of ammo cases where Trautman
had been hidden is thrown back.  Doyle knows better than
to mess with him.

Trautman switches off the radio as Kirkhill shouts
incoherently.


INT./ EXT.  HUEY

As he approaches the black Sikorsky Rambo sees Trautman
with a rifle to Doyle's head.
He nods as they pass.


INT./ EXT.  SIKORSKY

Rambo's Huey passes by them, crossing into Thailand.

				TRAUTMAN
		Escort them on in.


EXT.  MOTC

Rambo's Huey, followed by the Sikorsky, descends toward
the landing field.  As the techs and other camp personnel
stand watching, Kirkhill raises a pair of powerful field
glasses.

KIRKHILL'S POV - TELEPHOTO

The image of the Huey seems to waver insubstantially
through the long lens.  It looks like a death ship, the
Flying Dutchman with a crew of corpses and a demon at the
helm, coming in out of the dusk sky.

He slowly lowers the glasses.
Face ashen, Kirkhill backs into the command center and
closes the door.

The Huey sheers sideways across the staging area.
Its skids clip the top of the MOTC, shearing off
communications gear.
It hits the ground.  Bounces.
Slews around, scraping hideously.

And stops.
The Sikorsky settles behind it.

The two choppers whine-down.  Standing beside the cockpit,
Trautman gets on the Sikorsky's loudspeaker.

				TRAUTMAN
		All base personnel.  Prepare medical
		facilities to receive American POWs.

A cheer is raised among the ground contingent as they
surge forward.

ON RAMBO

sliding painfully out of the flight seat.  Brewer gawks at
the pool of blood collected in the hollow of Rambo's seat.

Rambo goes to the gun door.  Takes De Fravio's AK-47.

DOLLYING WITH RAMBO as he limps toward the MOTC with
relentless determination.  The well-wishing ground
personnel fall back, letting him pass.

Trautman, B.G., sees him and strides forward to intercept.

OVER RAMBO'S SHOULDER

DOLLYING, as he approaches the command center.
Kirkhill's aide, in dark glasses, moves forward to
restrain him.

Rambo motions him aside with the AK.
Goes to the door.  It is locked.


INT.  MOTC

The lock is shattered by a LONG BLAST from Rambo's AK.
The door is kicked open.  Rambo stands silhouetted.

He looks like what we never saw in "The Monkey's Paw."
He moves into the humming command center, among the
mission control electronics, reeking of the jungle, blood
and death.

LOW ANGLE

as Rambo walks to Kirkhill, looming.  Stopping.

Kirkhill quails as Rambo grasps him by the collar and
flings him backward into a chair.
He raises the AK.  Muzzle to Kirkhill's forehead.

				RAMBO
		Mission accomplished.

Pulls the trigger.
The weapon CLICKS, EMPTY.

HOLD ON KIRKHILL, trembling.


EXT.  MOTC

Rambo steps unsteadily out into the waning light.
He takes a deep, slow breath.  Starts to walk.  He salutes
as he passes Trautman but says nothing.

In the B.G. they are carrying the POWs in stretchers or
pushing them in wheelchairs toward the MEDICAL TRAILER.
Rambo watches Brewer posing with his arms around Jensen
and another POW for the grunt we saw earlier.  His pocket
Instamatic is clicking away.

				BREWER
			(expansively)
		Cover of Time Magazine, baby!

Rambo walks away... alone.

				DE FRAVIO (O.S.)
		Hey, Rambo!

Rambo turns.  De Fravio, propped up on one elbow on his
stretcher as he is carried past, gives him a broad,
appreciative grin.

				DE FRAVIO
		You did good, buddy.  Real good!

Rambo stands blinking for a second.  He raises his hand in
a big "thumbs up" and allows himself to grin.

                          THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER
                            The Complete Script


(opening:     The camera slowly zooms through a variety of insects and rocks.
              We follow a small yellow bug climb up a blade of grass.  As it
              spreads its wings to fly, we are whisked along the Australian
              outback and prairie by Ayers rock and eventually slow down as we
              approach Cody's house.)

(scene:  inside Cody's room.  The camera pans around to show Cody sleeping
         in his hammock.  The sound of Faloo's call is heard.  Cody hears
         it, jumps out of bed, and runs to the window.  He puts on his
         shirt and grabs his knife.)

(scene:  Cody sneaks past his mother who is in the kitchen listening to the
         radio.)

Announcer:    ... thundershowers are expected in the Crocodile Falls area and
              some of the surrounding gullies so take out your...

(scene:  Outside Cody's house.  Cody leaves the house, and closes the door
         behind him, but not quietly.)

Mom:     (from inside upon hearing the door) Cody!

Cody:    (whincing) Yeah mom?

Mom:     What about your breakfast?

Cody:    I've got some sandwiches in my pack.

Mom:     Well be home for supper.

Cody:    (hopping the gate) No worries mom.

(scene:  Cody runs toward the forest; Faloo's call is heard in the
         background.  He runs past some rock formations and enters the
         woods.  Birds follow him; and squak at him.)

Cody:    (to the birds) I know, I'm coming.

    (Cody jumps over a hollow log)
          Hustle up Nelson, Faloo's sounding the call!

    (Cody slides through a log, picks up a stick, and beats on the roof of
    the wombats home.)
          C'mon little wombats, hurry!

    (Cody continues to run through the forest with all of the animals
    following him.)

    (Cody arrives at the tree where Faloo has been sounding the call.)

         (to Faloo) Who's caught this time?

Faloo:   You don't know her, Cody, her name is Marahute, the great golden
         eagle.

Cody:    Where is she?

Faloo:   She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap.  You're the
         only one who can reach her.

Cody:    I'll get her loose.

Faloo:   Right-oh, hop on, no time to lose.

    (Cody hops onto Faloo and they travel through the forest and along a
    stream/river; more scenes of animals and the forest.)

    (They arrive at the cliff.)

         (pointing up towards the cliff) She's up on top of that ridge.  Be
         careful lit'l friend.

(scene:  various "time lapse" views of Cody climbing up the cliff.)

    (Cody reaches the top and sees the eagle.)

Cody:    Marahute!

    (Cody looks at the eagle; he approaches her slowly; she hears him and
    wakes up; Marahute screeches and struggles to get free.)

         (reassuring) Calm down, calm down.  I'm not gonna hurt you.  (Cody
         strokes Marahute on the head) That's a girl.
         Stay still... it's o.k.

    (Cody gets out his knife; Marahute sees the glint of the knife and
    begins to struggle and scream)

         No wait!  I'm here to help you... easy!... easy!

    (Cody cuts two ropes.  Cody cuts the last rope to free Marahute.)

         You're free!!

    (As Marahute spreads her wings to fly, she knocks Cody off the cliff.)

         Aaaiigh!

    (Cody falls; Marahute dives down to catch him; she catches him just
    before he hits the ground; they begin to fly around; the animals see
    Cody on Marahute and stand in awe; Marahute files over several rock
    formations; the fly up above the clouds; Cody looks at his reflection in
    Marahute's eye.)

         Higher!

    (They fly even higher above the clouds; Marahute throws Cody and catches
    him; Cody is now held in Marahute's talons.)

         Woah!

    (Cody mocks an eagle screech; he laughs as Marahute tickles him; they
    cruise above the clouds which eventually open up to show the ground;
    Marahute nose dives towards the ground and a stream; she holds Cody just
    high enough above the water so that he is water skiing; they approach a
    flock of birds; Marahute lets Cody go and he skims through the birds,
    scattering them; Marahute grabs Cody just before he falls in and then
    put Cody right in front of her, on her beak (pushing him from behind);
    they go over the egde of a waterfall; Marahute catches Cody again; this
    time he rides by standing on her back; they arrive at Marahute's nest)

         Wow!

    (Cody and Marahute look at each other; Cody falls over as he attempts to
    look at Marahute upside down. Marahute moves some grass and feathers to
    show Cody her eggs)

         You're a mom!

    (Cody puts his ear to the eggs)

         They're very warm.  Are they gonna hatch soon?

    (Marahute ruffles her neck feathers in an affectionate manner; she sits
    on the eggs and then looks out "over her domain".)

         Where's the daddy eagle?  (Marahute drops her head) Oh... my dad's
         gone too.

    (Cody give Marahute an affectionate stroke;  as they fix the covering on
    the eggs, the wind picks up and blows a feather in Cody's face; he looks
    at it, plays with it, and puts it back.  Marahute picks it up and gives
    it to Cody and he gives her a hug.)

    (Marahute and Cody are now on the ground; Marahute takes off and Cody
    runs around making flying noises)

(scene:  just inside the forest.  A wanted poster of McLeach is posted on a
         tree; A mouse is tied up with a bell attached to it that rings as
         it struggles; Cody hears the bell and goes over to the mouse.)

Cody:    Heh heh... hey little fella, what happened to you?

Baitmouse:    (panicking) Oh no! No, no, no, no!!  Get away, get away! It's a
              trap, it's a trap.  Be careful, NO!

Cody:    (as the mouse is speaking) Don't worry, I'll get you loose.  Woah!
         (Cody falls into the trap.  He looks up to see a blinking light
         and the alarm.)

(scene:  McLeach's truck; the radar has a blip on the screen.)

McLeach: (laughs)  Got one!!

(scene:  back in the hole/trap where Cody has fallen.)

Baitmouse:    (from the top of the hole) Are you alright?

Cody:    (rubbing his head) Yeah, I think so.

Baitmouse:    Okey-dokey. (he runs off)

Cody:    Wait!  Hey!  Come back!

    (Cody tries to climb out; he gets halfway up, grabs a tree root; it
    breaks and he falls; the baitmouse begins to lower a vine down to help
    Cody)

Baitmouse:    Here you go, grab on.

Cody:    That's great, just a little more, a little further... there!  I
         got it.

    (a rumble is heard and the ground begins to shake.)

Baitmouse:    Uh-oh.

    (view of McLeach's vehicle trampling through the forest disturbing
    everything)

Baitmouse:    Yipe!

    (The vine is severed as McLeach's truck comes to a screeching halt; Cody
    falls; the truck opens; Joanna leans over pit and growls; Cody yells)

McLeach: (unseen, approaching the trap) Well Joanna, what'd we get today?
         A dingo, a fat ol' razorback, or a nice big.... (he sees Cody)
         boy?!?

    (McLeach thinks for a second, gives a dirty look to Joanna and kicks
    her.)
         Joanna, you been diggin' holes out here again??  (mumbling to
         himself) Dumb lizard always tryin' to bury squirrels out here.

Cody:    Unh-unh.  It's a trap, and poachin's against the law.

McLeach: Trap?!  Where'd you get an idea like that??  Boy I think you've
         been down in that hole for too long.  (he holds his gun out so
         that Cody can grab it) Well c'mon, grab ahold.  We'll get you out
         of this little ol' lizard hole and you can just run along home.

    (Joanna has spotted the baitmouse on Cody's backpack.  She hisses and
    makes a face.)

Cody:    This IS a poacher's trap and YOU'RE a poacher.

    (The mouse ducks back into the backpack; Joanna jumps on Cody, knocking
    McLeach into the hole; his gun goes off; Joanna begins to attach Cody's
    backpack.)

         (to Joanna) Let go!!  Hey get off of me!!

McLeach: I'm gonna kill her.  (climbing out of the hole) I'm gonna kill
         that dumb, slimey, egg-sucking salamander.

Cody:    Cut it out!  Get off of me!

    (Joanna continues to attack the backpack; McLeach picks up his gun; he
    points it at Joanna; looking through gun scope McLeach aims at Joanna,
    she tries to get out of his view; as she does this, McLeach spots the
    feather in Cody's pack; he picks up Cody by his backpack.)

McLeach: Hmmm.... good girl Joanna.  (Joanna looks up and grins happily.)

         (to Cody) Say where'd you get this pretty feather boy?

Cody:    (humbly) It was a present.

McLeach: (coddling) Oh, that's real nice.  Who gave it to ya?

Cody:    (stumbling) It's a s... secret.

McLeach: That's no secret boy, you see, (menacing) I already got the
         father.  (makes a cutting sound and draws a feather across his
         neck like he was slashing a throat).  He, he he.  You just tell me
         where momma and those little eggs are.

    (Cody breaks free from McLeach by slipping out of his backpack.)

Cody:    NO!!

McLeach: Joanna, sick 'em!

    (Cody runs through forest with Joanna close behind; he enters an open
    area where we see a waterfall and water; Cody stops right at the edge of
    the small cliff that drops into the water (Crocodile Falls); Joanna
    follows close behind; Cody reaches into his pocket and pulls out his
    knife; he drops it; McLeach steps on his hand.)

McLeach: You're comin' with me boy.

Cody:    My mom'll call the rangers!

McLeach: (sarcastically)  Oh no.... not the rangers, what'll I do??
         What'll I do??!  Don't let your mom call the rangers!!  Please
         don't!!  (Joanna laughs) (McLeach laughs)  (McLeach throws Cody's
         backpack into the river)  My poor baby boy got eaten by the
         crocodiles, boo-hoo-hoo!  Let's go boy!

Cody:    (from inside McLeach's cage)  Help!  Help!

    (The baitmouse sees Cody in the cage; he runs to the local RAS telegraph
    office; it begins to rain and wind is blowing; he bursts through the
    door as the telegraph mouse is eating.)

Baitmouse:  (very fast and excited) Help, help, help!!  Someone help!  McLeach
            took the boy.  He took the little boy.  Send for help!!

    (The telegraph mouse begins typing the message in morse code; camera
    pans up to roof, where other mice aim the antenna; message is seen being
    relayed to the Marshall Islands)

    (In a wrecked plane on the Marshall Islands, a mouse listens to the
    morse code message; he recognizes the distress call, activates the
    controls on the plane, and relays message to Hawaii.)

    (Message is seen being relayed to Hawaii.  Screens fill with RAS RAS
    RAS.  Mice are watching through binoculars in the back.  The send a
    signal to other mice.  They dial the phone to distract guard.  Phone
    rings.  Guard leaves.  Mice take over, type (jump) on keyboard and read
    message.  "RAS... RAS... ATTENTION BOY KIDNAPPED IN AUSTRALIA IMMEDIATE
    ACTION REQUIRED"  They type "Relay to New York".)

    (Message then journeys across the ocean to Los Angeles, then to Denver,
    St. Louis, Chicago, Washington D. C. and then New York.)

(scene:  It is winter in New York; through the clouds, the camera descends
         upon the UN building; a mouse is listening to the transmission at
         the RAS headquarters in New York)

Mouse:   Code red, code red!!  Attention all Rescue Aid Society delegates,
         all delegates please report immediately to the main assembly hall.
         This is an emergency meeting.  I repeat, this is a code red
         emergency meeting!!

    (the delegates have been assembling as the announcement was being made)

(scene:  inside the RAS meeting hall)

Chairmouse:   Order!  Order!  Yes, yes I know it's late but I'm... oh really!
            Sir Charles.  Hello, hello Frank, how are you, nice to see you!
            And Esmerelda, there you are!  Ha ha.. all right, quiet now
            please, everyone pay attention.  There has been a kidnapping in
            Australia.  (delegates gasp)  A young boy needs our help.  This is
            a mission requiring our very finest, and I know we are all
            thinking of the same two mice.  (everyone looks to the seats of
            Hungary and USA, which are empty)  (delegates gasp again.)  What's
            this?!?  Gone?  We must find Bernard and Miss Bianca at once!

(scene:  a posh restaurant)

    (as a waiter walks by a pillar/column in the restaurant, a pea drops on
    the floor; a cricket comes out of the column and picks it up.)

Cricket: Oh.... pea soup.

    (With an elaborate contraption, he launches the pea up the column where
    it drops into a thimble-pot of the cook)

Cricket cook: Pea soup!

    (A waiter cricket comes along and picks up the soup; the scene changes
    to the chandelier over the restaurant and we see a mini-restaurant above
    the real one.)

Bianca:  To my dear Bernard, and our wonderful partnership.

Bernard: (nervous and fumbling) Ah... yeah.. yeah.. ah.. won... wonderful.

Bianca:  You've been very quiet this evening, is there something on your
         mind?

Bernard: Well, ummm... actually... I, ah... I was wondering.... (he reaches
         into his pocket.)

Bianca:  Yes darling?

Bernard: I... Miss Bianca would you.... would you... (the ring falls
         through a hole in Bernard's pocket onto the floor) would you
         excuse me for a minute?

    (Bernard chases the ring across the floor; he crawls around, sees it,
    and just as he goes to grab it, a waiter kicks it under another table;
    Francois arrives at their table.)

Francois:     (French accent) Pardonnez moi, mademoiselle Bianca, I have
              important news.  (He hands her a piece of paper.)

Bianca:  Yes Francois?  What is it?

Francois:     You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to
              Australia.

Bianca:  (reading message) Oh the poor boy.  This is dreadful.  Now where
         is Bernard I must tell him at once!

Francois:     Allow me madame, I will tell him immediately.

    (Bernard is seen under a table retrieving ring; the ring finds its way
    onto the foot of a rather large woman mouse who is having dinner with a
    rather nerdy looking man mouse; as Bernard removes the ring from her
    foot, she think the man mouse is playing footsie with her and smacks the
    man mouse.)

Bernard: (practicing)  Miss Bianca, will you marry me?  Miss Bianca, will
         you please marry me?

Francois:     (as Bernard practices) Quickly monsieur Bernard!  I must speak
              with you....

Bernard: Not now Francois, I'm busy!

Francois:     No, no, no, no, monsieur you don't......

    (As Francois attempts to follow Bernard he collides with another cricket
    watier and falls on his back; various crickets run to help him.)

    (Bernard returns to the table)

Bianca:  Bernard, did you talk to Francois?

Bernard: Ah yes, but uh.. there's... there's something I want ......

Bianca:  I know exactly what you're going to say.  Francois told me all
         about it.

Bernard: He did?  How, how... how did he ...

Bianca:  Oh it doesn't matter, I think it's a marvelous idea.

Bernard: (shocked) You do?  I mean, you... you really want to?

Bianca:  I don't think it's a matter of wanting, it's a matter of duty.

Bernard: D-duty?  I... I never thought of it, well, umm... all righ.... all
         right.  How does... how does next ah-April sound to you?

Bianca:  Heavens no!  We must act immediately, tonight!  (she leaves the
         restaurant with Bernard close behind)

Bernard: Tonight?  But, but, ah.. wait!  Uh, Bianca, this is so sudden, I
         mean, don't you at least need a gown or something?

Bianca:  No, just a pair of khaki shorts and some hiking boots!

Bernard: Hiking boots?

(scene:  in the RAS meeting hall)

Chairmouse:   Ah, there you are, come along, come along.

Bianca:  Delegates, we have an important announcement.  Bernard and I have
         decided, (pause) to accept the mission to Australia.

Bernard: (surprised)  Australia?

Chairmouse:   Oh good show!  Now, you must fly out immediately!  It's a little
              nippy outside, but we won't let that stop us, will we?  What?
              (laughs)

(scene:  on top of a building, snow and wind blowing all around)

Bernard: (yelling) Miss Bianca, I'm not sure it's such a good idea to... to
         fly this soon after eating!

Bianca:  Darling you'll be just fine!

Bernard: But aren't, aren't you supposed to wait 45 minutes?

Bianca:  (annoyed) Oh, just knock on the door and see if Orville is there!!

Bernard: (knocks slightly)  (quickly) Well, nobody's home, let's go.

    (Bernard gets buried with snow)

Bianca:  Bernard!!  (scodling) This is no time to play in the snow.

Bernard: I wasn't playing in the snow.  It... it was an avalanche.

Bianca:  Oh look Bernard!   (reading the sign) Under new management, see
         Wilbur.  C'mon darling, let's get a move out!

(scene:  inside Wilbur's hangar; Wilbur is seen singing and dancing along
         with some music)

Bianca:  Yoo-hoo!  Mr. Wilbur!  Hello?

Bernard: Look out!!  Excuse me!

Bianca:  Bernard DO something!  He can't hear us!

    (Bernard "struggles" to get to the boom box and Wilbur continues to
    dance.)

Wilbur:  (singing) The girls all look (music stops) when I go by..... Hey,
         who killed the music?!?

Bernard: That's better.

Bianca:  Excuse us for interrupting, we're from the Rescue Aid Society.  I
         am Miss Bianca...

Wilbur:  (interrupting) Miss Bianca!?!

Bianca:  and this is my....

Wilbur:  (still interrupting) THE Miss Bianca?  I don't believe it.  My
         brother Orville told me ALL about you, oh boy, I... this is an
         honor to have.... may I just say enceinte senorita to you?  May I?
         (kisses her hand)

Bernard: Ahem.  (deliberately) We need to charter a flight.

Wilbur:  Well, you've come to the right place, buddy boy, welcome to
         (pause) "Albatross Air"  -  a fair fare from here to there.
         (laughs)  Get it?  A fair fare?  It's a... a play on... nevermind,
         I've got tons of exotic destinations, far away places, custom
         designed for (in a seductive voice) "romantic weekend getaways".
         (laughs)  As well as the finest in-flight accomodations.  Speaking
         of which, what can I get ya?  (fumbles, searches through his
         cooler)  How about a nice mango-Maui cooler?  Very, very nice,
         very tasty....

Bianca:  No thank you...

Wilbur:  Or a ah..... (fumbles about) Coconut guava nectar?  It's
         carbonated.  Very nice.  I got little umbrellas for each one of
         them and a little coconut thing....

Bianca:  No, it's urgent that we leave immediately!

Wilbur:  (disappointed)  Nothing?  Nothing at all?

Bernard: (dismayed) Wilbur.

Wilbur:  How about a cream soda?

Bernard: Now look, we need a flight to Australia.

Wilbur:  Australia?  The Land Down Under?  That's a fabulous idea!  So when
         can I pencil you in?  Ah... after spring thaw?  You know, mid-June
         would be very nice.

Bianca:  Oh know, we must leave TONIGHT.

Wilbur:  (spits out his drink) TONIGHT?  (coughs and laughs) C'mon you're
         kiddin' me right?  (laughs) Have you looked outside?  (he opens
         the window) It's suicide out there!  Oh-ho, oh no.  OH NO....I'm
         afraid your jolly little holiday will have to wait.  (laughs)
         What a bunch of jokers.

Bianca:  But you don't understand, a boy needs our help, he's in trouble.

Wilbur:  A boy?  You mean, a little kid kinda boy?

Bianca:  He was kidnapped.

Wilbur:  Kidnapped?  (remorseful) Aw... that... that's awful.  Lockin' up a
         little kid.  A kid should be free.  Free to run wild through the
         house on Saturday mornings, (gathering strength) free to have
         cookies and milk, and get those little white moustaches, you know,
         with the..... (determined) NOBODY'S gonna take a kid's freedom
         away while I'm around, nobody, do you hear me?!?

Bianca:  Does that mean you'll take us?

Wilbur:  (with conviction) Storm or no storm, Albatross Airlines, at your
         service!! (Wilbur salutes)

    (scene changes to Bernard and Bianca on Wilbur's back)

         Passengers are requested to please fasten their seat belts and
         secure all carry-ons.  We'll be departing following our standard
         pre-flight maintenance.  Thank you.

    (Wilbur begins to exercise)

         Yeah, loosen up, get the blood flowin' up to the head, annnnnd,
         couple of these....oh!  (tries to do a push-up) O.k.  one's
         enough, here we go.  Oh!  Ah yeah!!  That feels better.  Oh baby.
         Tie your kangaroos down sports fans, here, we, COME!

    (opens hangar doors, gets blown back by wind)

         Yeah, let's go for it!!  Woah!  Hey!  Woah!  Hey, I didn't adjust
         for the winds.  All right we're gonna make it!!  I just gotta duck
         down a little lower, that's all.    Go under the wind, go under
         it!  Here we go (screams)!!  Ow this is cold!  Slippery!  Ice!
         Ice!  We got ice!  We got ice!  Oh hang on now!!  Here we go!
         Here we go!  Here we go!!!  HERE WE GO!!  COWABUNGA!!!!!!!

    (Wilbur dives for the street; "flies" just in time to miss the ground.)

Bianca:  Captain, is this a non-stop flight to Australia??

Wilbur:  Well, ah...not exactly no, I could definitely say no.  We're gonna
         have to make connections with a bigger bird.  (aside)  Non-stop?
         What do I look like, Charles Lindburgh??

(scene:  McLeach driving his vehicle with Cody in the cage in the
         Australian outback.)

Cody:    (pounding on the cage) Lemme outta here!!  Lemme go!!  You can't
         do this!!  Help!  Help!  Help!

McLeach: (on speaker)  Breaker, breaker, little mate.  I forgot to tell ya
         around here, you need to be QUIET!!  (Cody trips)  Or the rangers
         might hear ya.  Now sit down and relax, enjoy the view.  (laughs)
         Nothin' but abandoned opal mines as far as the eye can see.  And
         dead ahead, is home sweet home.  (begins singing) (from a
         distance) Home, home on the range.  Where the critters are tied up
         in chains.  I cut through their sides, and I rip off their hides.
         And the next day I do it again.  Everybody!  Home, home on the
         range.....

(scene:  long shot of Cody's house)

Mom:     Cody!  Cody!  Cody!

(scene:  cargo hold of airplane; Wilbur, Bernard, and Miss Bianca are
         sleeping on an airplane tire.)

Announcer:    (heard from inside of plane)  Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 is
         now approaching Sydney airport, make sure you pick up your parcels
         and packages and enjoy your stay in Australia.

    (Miss Bianca wakes up, gives Bernard a kiss to wake him up.)

Bernard: (just waking up) (yawns) Are we there yet?

Bianca:  Yes.  You know, perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.

Bernard: Oh, oh... alright, I'll get him up.  (leaning over)  Ahhh...
         Wilbur?  (Wilbur is snoring)  Wilbur?  Wilbur??

Wilbur:  (half awake) Um, yeah, just five more minutes ma.  (Wilbur rolls
         over, trapping Bernard and Bianca)

Bianca and Bernard:     (screams) Wilbur!!

Wilbur:  (groggy) That's all I need, five more minutes.

Bianca:  (pleading) Wilbur??  Are you awake??

Bernard: Get, get up we're there!!

Wilbur:  O.k. I'm up, I'm up. (he rolls back over)

Bernard: Watch out you got....

Wilbur:  (groans)  Oh!  I must'a been sleepin' on a bolt.  Ooo.  (plane
         body opens)  Oh boy.  Throw another shrimp on the barbie girls,
         cause HERE I COME!!

Bernard: Here we go again!!

Wilbur:  CANNONBALL!!!!!

Bianca:  Weeee!!

    (Wilbur "cannonballs" out of the airplane; he runs into a flock of
    seagulls on his way down and passes the Sydney Opera House.)

Wilbur:  Gang way!  Comin' through, mice on board!!  Clear the way!  Move
         over madam, there you go!  Comin' through sir, thank you.
         (laughs)  Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.  Did we lose anyone back
         there?  (laughs).

Bernard: Miss Bianca, from.. from now on, can't... can't we just take the
         train?

(scene:  Mugwomp flats "control tower".  Jake and Sparky are playing
         checkers.)

Jake:    Well Sparky, you've had this comin' for a long time.  And now,
         you're gonna get it.  Ha!

    (Jake jumps one of Sparky's pieces; Sparky spits and then jumps a bunch
    of Jake's pieces.)

Jake:    Hmmm... wise fly.  (Sparky laughs)

Wilbur:  (over radio)  Mugwomp tower, Mugwomp tower, this is Albatross One
         Three requesting permission to land.  Over?

Jake:    Albatross?  (Jake flips over the checkerboard to a chart that has
         various bird sizes)  Let's see... finch, wren, scrub bird,
         lockeet, freckled duck, culah, kukaberra, parrot, cockatoo,
         alba... alba...?!?!  It's a jumbo!!

         (into radio)  Negative one three, you'll have to turn back, our
         runway isn't long enough for a bird your size.

Wilbur:  Not long enough?!?  Look pal, I can land this thing on a dime!

Bernard: (heard over radio) Uh... Wilbur, if, if the runway isn't long
         enough...

Wilbur:  Listen you can't let these radar jockeys push you around.  Just
         leave it to me alright?

Jake:    (into radio) I say again mate, our runway is too short.

Wilbur:  And I say again, MATE, I'm comin' in!!

Jake:    Crazy Yank.  Quick Sparky, we gotta find a way to extend the
         runway.

    (Jake and Sparky begin to make the runway longer; Jake kicks a cinder
    block raising part of the roof.)

Wilbur:  Here we go!

Bernard: We..., we'll never make it!!

Wilbur:  (as he bounces along roof)  Hot!  Oooh!  Ow!  Passengers please
         remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete
         stop.  Thank you.

    (Jake and Sparky continue to extend the runway; Wilbur lands on an
    umbrella and spins around.)

Jake:    Quick Sparky, we need to make a drag line!

    (an elaborate clothesline/hangar/brassiere drag line is constructed;
    Wilbur is catapulted into the drag line; when he stops, he is "wearing"
    the bra.)

Wilbur:  (cocky) Don't try and tell ME the runway's too short.  Ha!  (to
         Jake) Hold this for me will ya pal?  (Wilbur "hands" him the bra
         which launches Jake backwards.)

Jake:    Bloke oughtta have his wings clipped.

Wilbur:  You captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines.....

Jake:    (aside to Sparky) Crazy Yanks.  They think they can do any fool
         thing, without regard for.....

    (he sees Bianca; becomes starry-eyed; Sparky wonders what happened;
    looks at Jake; Sparky buzzes in dismay)

         (being suave) Welcome to Australia ma'am.  My name's Jake and if
         there's any way I can make your stay more pleasant, don't hesitate
         to ask.

Bianca:  Oh, how kind.

Jake:    Allow me to get that bag for ya.

Bernard: (struggling)  I've a.... I've got a lot of... luggage here...

Wilbur:  Here let me give you a hand with those bags pal, all part of the
         friendly service here at Albatross Air (Wilbur picks up two of the
         bags; a crunch is heard)  Ow!  Oh!  Big time hurt!  Ah back!!  Oh
         it's out!

Bianca:  Wilbur, are you alright?

Jake:    Don't worry ma'am, I'll handle this.  Sparky, you watch the tower,
         we gotta get this bird to the hospital.

Wilbur:  Oh.... can't go down, can't go up.  Oh ! Take the bags, take the
         bags!

(scene:  an old military hospital vehicle.  Wilbur is being lowered inside
         by a series of ropes, gears and nursemice.)

Nursemice:    Heave!  Ho!  Heave!  Ho!

Wilbur:  Hey, whaddya doin'?  Hey, what... what's going on?  Wait!  Hey
         wait a minute... just stop everything.

Bianca:  Wilbur, don't worry.  We'll come back the moment we find the boy.

Wilbur:  (begging) Wait!  Hey!  Wait a minute!  Don't leave me here,
         please!  I'm feeling much better now.  I'm even ready to hit the
         beaches (laughs).  I'm even ready to mambo.  (Wiggles in the
         restraints).

Bianca:  Doctor, will he be alright?

Doctor:  (consoling) Now, now, my dear.  Keep a stiff upper lip.  They all
         come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin.  Off with you now.
         Leave everything to me.  Shoo, shoo, off you go.

(they leave)

         Hop to it ladies, we've got a bent bird on our hands.  Move, move,
         move, bustle, bustle, bustle.  That's it, ah-ha.

Wilbur:  Will it, will it hurt doc?

Doctor:  Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.  (to the nurse mice) Launch the
         back brace!

    (the "back brace" (a cane) is "launched" to immobilize Wilbur's back.)

Wilbur:  Hey!  Hey wait!  Wait!  Woah!! I've been skewered.

Doctor:  (cross) I've already missed tea, Mr. Albatross, now don't force me
         to take drastic measures.  You MUST relax.

Wilbur:  Relax?!?  I have never been more relaxed in my life!!  (begins to
         get hyper) If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead!!!

Doctor:  (smug) I'm not convinced.  (to the nurse mice) Sixty milligrams!

Nursemice:    Sixty milligrams.

    (the nursemice fill hypodermic needle with liquid and put it into the
    chamber of a shotgun.)

Wilbur:  Hey... wha.... are... are you guys crazy?  You can't do that to
         me!  I'm an American citizen buddy!!!

Doctor:  Better double it!

Wilbur:  DOUBLE?!?

Nursemice:    Double, coming up! (they load up another needle in the other
              chamber.)

Wilbur:  Nooo!!

Doctor:  Prepare the albatross for medication.

Wilbur:  Oh, I'm dreamin'... I'm dreamin'!!  Come on Wilbur, wake up boy,
         wake up!!

Doctor:  (giving directions to aim the gun.) Three degrees right.

Wilbur:  Come on!!

Nursemice:    Three degrees right.

Wilbur:  Come on, it's a joke, it's a joke!

Doctor:  Down two degrees.

Wilbur:  Oh no, don't go down two degrees!

Nursemice:    Down two degrees.

Doctor:  Ready!

Wilbur:  No I'm not ready!!  No, please!!

Doctor:  Aim!!

Wilbur:  (crying) please don't do this to me......

Doctor:  FIRE!!

    (the scene changes to outside and we hear the gun fire.)

Wilbur:  Ow, ow, oh. ooo......

(scene:  Mugwomp Flats; Bernard and Bianca are looking at a map)

Bernard: Now we just.... gotta figure out how to get there.

Jake:    So, ah... you and your umm... husband here on a little outback
         excursion?

Bianca:  Oh no, no, we're not married.

Bernard: In fact we're, we're here on a, a top ah.. secret mission.
         Very... very.. hush, hush.

Jake:    Oh!  Gotta rescue that kid McLeach nabbed eh?

Bianca:  Why that's right!  How did you know?

Jake:    (he bumps Bernard out of the way) (whispering to Bianca) You'll
         find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback miss.  (outloud)
         So ah.... which way ya takin'?  (looking at Bernard's map.)
         Suicide trail through Nightmare Canyon, or the shortcut at Satan's
         ridge?

Bernard: Su... Suicide trail?

Jake:    Good choice.  (dramatically) More snakes, less quicksand.  Then
         once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot free, this is until
         ummm... Dead Dingo Pass.

Bernard: (puzzled) Wait, wait, wait a minute, I don't.... I don't see any,
         any of that, that stuff on the map.

Jake:    A map's no good in the outback!  (folding up the map)  What you
         really need is someone, (schmoozing to Bianca) someone who KNOWS
         the territory.

Bianca:  Oh Mister Jake, will you guide us?

Jake:    At your service!  (he bows and shoves the map behind him into
         Bernard's gut.)  Here better take my arm miss it's gonna be a
         treacherous hike.  (beginning to tell a story) I remember the time
         Miss B. it was just me and four hundred of these big giant.....

Bernard: Doesn't even know how to fold a map....

(scene:  the rangers are at Crocodile Falls searching the water; then we
         see Bernard, Miss Bianca and Jake on a wombat in a tree getting
         ready to jump.)

Jake:    This is how we get around in the outback Miss B.  (shouting)  The
         only way to travel, eh Berno?

Bernard: Ah yeah, yeah, it's just a little, a little ah.. bumpy back here.

    (Bernard is bobbing along on the tail; the wombat climbs to the top of
    the tree and jumps.)

Jake:    Cinch up your seatbelts mates, we're comin' in for a landing.

    (the wombat lands on a small bush; Jake and Miss Bianca get off the
    wombat; however the bush isn't exactly stable yet...)

Bernard: Hold it, not, not yet!! (Bernard gets launched into a patch of
         briars.)

(scene:  McLeach's hideout)

McLeach: (sharpening a knife) Well boy, let's see if we can do something to
         refresh that rusty old memory of yours.  Is she on Satan's Ridge?
         (throws a knife at the map Cody is standing in front of) Or
         Nightmare Canyon??  (throws another knife) Whadda you think
         Joanna?  Yeah, that's it... right smack dab in the middle at Croc
         Falls!  (throws another knife) (to Cody) Am I gettin' warm??

Cody:    I told you, I don't remember.

McLeach: Don't you realize a bird that size is worth a fortune??  (in
         Cody's face) I'll split the money with you fifty-fifty, you can't
         get a better offer than that boy.

Cody:    You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you.

McLeach: (growls in anger) (he kicks over the kettle of water in the fire).

(scene:  Bernard and Bianca in the forest by the water; Bianca is removing
         the burrs from Bernard.)

Bernard: Jake's been gone... ow.... been gone a long time... maybe I should
         go, oh!  Maybe I should go look for him.

Bianca:  Oh don't you worry about Jake, he can handle himself.

Bernard: Yeah, I... I noticed.

Bianca:  I am just sure he'll be back in no time.

    (Bernard reaches into his pocket and pulls out the ring to make sure
    it's still there.)

Bernard: You know... now that we're alone, (nervous) there's... there's
         something that I've, I've been wanting to uh... to.. to ask you.

Bianca:  Yes?  What is it?

Bernard: (he walks over to Bianca) Well, it's uh.... it's like this... Miss
         Bianca I.... (he gets down on one knee) I would be... (he takes
         her hand) most honored... if..  if...

Jake:    LOOK OUT!!!  (Jake bursts through the two of them; Bianca screams)
         No mice for you Twister not today!!  (Jake proceeds to lasso the
         mouth of Twister the snake.) There!

Bernard: Miss Bianca!

Jake:    (assertively) I've been looking all over for you.  Now look... we
         got a long way to go, and you're gonna take us there, and you're
         not gonna give us any trouble about it.  Right??

    (Snake shakes his head no; Jake and Miss Bianca get on Twister.)

         They're perfectly harmless once you look 'em in the eye and let
         em' who's boss.  Ain't that right mate?  (smacks the snake.) Now
         git.

Bianca:  It's alright Bernard, Jake has everything under control.

Bernard: (disappointed and sarcastic) Yeah, I noticed.

Jake:   (going into a story again) You know Miss Bianca, truth be told, I
         used to be quite a dingo wrestler.  Yeah, there was this one time,
         it was just me and (his voice begins to trail off) 300 of these
         ferocious mouse-eating dingo's right... had me surrounded....
         decided to ....

    (Bernard, who is riding the end of the snake, get out the ring, dumps
    out the water, and sighs.)

(scene:  McLeach's animal prison; Mcleach throws Cody into a cage.)

McLeach: I'll give you a night down here to think it over.  But tomorrow,
         no more Mr. Nice Guy.  (McLeach slams the door, Joanna gets her
         tail caught in it.)  Joanna!  You thick-headed chunk of fish-bait!

Cody:    (yelling) I'll NEVER tell you where she is!  Never!  Never!

Frank:   (mimicking Cody) Yeah, never tell!  You'll have to drag it out of
         us!

Cody:    Hey, where did you come from?

Frank:   Um... the desert?

Krebbs:  Well, well, well, fancy that!  Looks likes McLeach has begun
         trapping his own kind!  There's no hope for any of us now.

Frank:   No hope!  No hope!  No! (cries)

Cody:    Be there MUST be a way out of here.

Krebbs:  Oh, there's a way out all right.

Cody (and others): There is?

Krebbs:  Absolutely.  (cocky) You'll go as a wallet, you'll go as a belt,
         and our dear Frank....

Frank:   No, no, no, I don't want to hear it.

Krebbs:  Frank will go as......

Frank:   I can't hear you... (Frank covers his ears and begins to sing a
         nonsense version of the Australian national anthem) la la la la
         la.....

Krebbs:  (pause until Frank uncovers his ears) A purse.

Frank:   Aiighh... no!! (cries)

Krebbs:  Ooo... a lovely ladies' purse.

Frank:   (crying) I don't want to go as a purse.  (begging) Please, please,
         don't let 'em do it!

Cody:    Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here.

Frank:   We are?

Cody:    Yeah!  If we all put our heads together, I'm sure we'll think of
         something.

Frank:   Yeah, something, something.... (begins to pant and think hard)

Cody:    Frank, what's wrong?

Krebbs:  Oh, here he goes again.

Red:     Take it easy mate, you don't want to hurt yourself again.

Frank:   (straining to think) I got it!!  All we gotta do, is get the
         keys!!

Krebbs:  (sarcastically) Ohhh!! Is that all??  Well then, we better start
         packing our bags.

Cody:    No wait, he's right.  If we could get these long pieces of
         wood.... (Cody strains to reach some long pieces of wood through
         his cage)

Frank:   Wood, yeah, wood, wood, wood, yeah good.

Cody:    Maybe we could.... (a bird in a "tire cage" helps knock the wood
         so Cody can reach it.)  that's right just a little more... there,
         (he gets a piece of wood) Come on everybody, get some more stuff!!

Red:     The kid's right, what are we waiting for?

Cody:    That's it, you've got it!  Hurry!  We need something to tie it
         together!

Frank:   Hey, hey, hey, whaddya got, whaddya got, whaddya got??  (Frank
         gets whopped with a shoe) (through the shoe) Shoelaces!  Oh.

    (the animals have constructed a long pole held up and together with rope
    and shoelaces; they begin to use their "pole" to get the keys.)

Cody:    Almost.... a little further...

Frank:   Yeah, yeah, yeah.  (Krebbs moans/cries as they miss the keys.)

Cody:    It's o.k. let's try again.

Frank:   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cody:    Easy... easy does it.

Frank:   Yeah, no, no, no, yeah, no, yeah, yeah (etc...)

Krebbs:  Somebody shut him up!!

    (they get the keys on the hook; the dangle right in front of the door.)

Frank:   You've got it! You've got it!  You've got it!

    (Joanna comes in, discovers keys, destroys pole, returns keys to hook,
    and leaves through the animal door.)

Frank:   (Frank strains to think again) I've got it!  I'll just take my
         tail.... and I'll pick the lock.... like this!!

Red:     Aww Frank, give it a rest.

Frank:   No, no, no!!  You'll thank me when you're free!  Look, look, look,
         I just insert my tail, like this, and I turn it like this, just a
         quarter turn to the left, and then push it a little bit
         further...... (etc.)

(scene change: Jake, Bianca, and Bernard are riding lightning bugs.)

Jake:    Ha, ha!!  Show him who's boss Berno!

    (Bernard is having obvious trouble with his bug; he hits a dandelion,
    attempts to sneeze, but goes underwater instead.)

(scene:  the hospital wagon)

Wilbur:  Ugh... I feel like I got my head in a vise. (zoom out to see
         Wilbur's head in a vise)  Unh...

Doctor:  Are we ready nurse?

Nursemouse:   Ready doctor.

Doctor:  Alright ladies, snap to it!  (he snaps his rubber gloves on)
         Ooo... that smarts!  Ah... let me see here.... (hums/sings to
         himself as he examines the x-ray)... forceps!

Nursemouse:   Forceps.

    (various tools posing as surgical equipment are tossed around.)

Wilbur:  Oh no, what now? (in the background the heart monitor begins to
         beep faster and faster throughout this part)

Doctor:  Spinal stretch-u-lator.

Wilbur:  Oh... that's gonna hurt.

Doctor:  Artery router.

Wilbur:  Mother!

Doctor:  This is rusted tight.  I wouldn't DREAM of using such a tool.
         Bring me the epidermal tissue disrupter! (which is actually a
         chainsaw)

Wilbur:  The epidermal what?!?!  (realizing what it is.) Oh no... no....
         NO!

    (Wilbur screams and breaks free; the nursemice set off an alarm and sign
    that says "Patient Escaping.")

Doctor:  Mr. Albatross we haven't operated yet!

Wilbur:  You gotta catch me first doc!!

Doctor:  Mr. Albatross, please!! (chasing Wilbur)

Wilbur:  Cowabunga!

Doctor:  Mr. Albatross, we must return you to the operating room!

Wilbur:  You'll never take me alive!!  (Wilbur attempts to climb out a
         window

Doctor:  Please don't do this!!  Your spine needs tender... (scream)....
         loving.... (scream).... care!  (they all fall backwards)

Wilbur:  Oh.  Ugh.  oh... oh... my... my back!  Hey, hey... I can, I, it
         works!!  I'm cured!!

Doctor:  My back!

    (Wilbur bursts out of the back of the hospital truck)

Wilbur:  Don't worry, I'm coming you little mice... this is the finest
         fleet on two webbed feet.  (panting)  Oh boy, I gotta, I gotta go
         on a diet when I get home.  Here we go!!

(scene: Cody's house)

    (a ranger knocks at the door; Cody's mom answers and we begin to hear
    the radio announcer in the background)

Announcer: ... those particular areas, in other news, authorities in Mugwomp
         Flats have called off the search for the missing boy.  His
         backpack was found near Crocodile Falls, and local rangers believe
         he was yet another victim of crocodile attack.
      (scene transitions to McLeach's hideout)
         Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution when
         they are....

McLeach: (to the radio) Ha heh!  Think you're pretty smart, don't you eh?
         Who outsmarted who?  Who?  Who outsmarted who?  I still gotta get
         that boy, to talking, huh?  (a thought strikes him) I'm hungry.
         Can't think on an empty stomach... gotta have protein... gotta
         have.... eggs.  (Joanna perks up at the word "eggs").

    (McLeach gets up and walks across the room; Joanna follows.)

         Everyone's got his price... all I gotta do is offer him whatever
         he wants... and then not give it to him.

    (Joanna opens the tool box, takes an egg and puts it in her mouth;
    throughout this scene, Joanna steals McLeach's eggs as he is talking out
    loud; he keeps moving the box back and forth in an attempt to stop her,
    which only makes matters worse.)

         (to Joanna) Did you take one of my eggs?  Open your mouth.  These
         are NOT Joanna eggs.  Let's see ummm... the boy's got the eagle...
         I want the eagle... the boy won't give me the eagle... if I could
         just find the boy's weak spot, I could get him to tell me where
         the eagle is.  But the boy's only got ONE weak spot, and that IS
         the eagle.  (aside/thinking out loud) Maybe if I stuck him in a
         giant anthill, that would loosen his tongue and then.... (yells) I
         got it!  (to Joanna)  Got your hand caught in the cookie jar,
         didn't ya?  Eh?  Who do you think you're messin' with you dumb
         animal, my mental facilities are twice what yours are, you
         peabrain.  (opens case, realizes all the eggs are gone)  (calmy at
         first, then more angry) (Joanna runs away and hides) Joanna.... I
         give you platypus eggs, I give you snake eggs, why I'll even give
         you eagle eggs, but I want you to stay away from my... (stops
         abruptly).... (whispers) the eagle's eggs!  That's it!  That's the
         boy's weak spot!  (Joanna whimpers in corner)

(scene: McLeach's animal prison)

Frank:   (still trying to open lock with his tail).  Push it in a little
         bit farther..... (mumbling).... (Frank opens the cage without
         realizing it and steps out.) (crying) I give up!  (kicks the door
         closed) I'll never get this.... we're doomed!  Doomed!

Red:     Hey look!  Krebbs, Frank's out!

Cody:    Frank, Frank, you're free!

Frank:   Free?!  (realizing) I'm free!  I'm free!  I'm free!  I'm free!....
         (continues)

Red:     Shhhhh!!! Joanna'll hear!

Krebbs:  Double or nothin' he's caught in five minutes.

Cody:    Calm down little mate.

Frank:   (sticks his head through the cage) Look at me, I'm free!

Cody:    Frank, get the keys.

Frank:   I should get the keys.  I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck....
         (continues and struggles)

Red:     Shhh quiet!

Krebbs:  Quiet ya fool!

Cody:    Take it easy, I'll get you loose.  (twists Frank back through the
         cage) There ya go.  (deliberately) Now go get the keys.

Frank:   The keys.  Yeah, yeah, keys, keys, keys, keys, keys.  (jumps to
         grab keys and misses) Gee, I can't reach 'em.

Cody:    Quick, get something to stand on.

Frank:   Yeah, stand on, something to stand on.

Krebbs:  This oughtta be rich.

Frank:   Yeah, yeah, stand on, stand on.... (etc.)

    (Frank gets a flat board, carries it across, throws it on the ground,
    thereby increasing his height by .01 inches.)

Everyone:     FRANK!

Cody:    Use the box!  Climb up on the box!

Frank:   (mumbles) (grunts) box, box..... etc.

    (Frank moves the box, climbs up, and grabs the keys; he falls over with
    them on top of the box which makes noise with them)

Everybody:    SHHHHH!  Quiet!

Frank:   (grumbles) These are heavy!

    (Frank kicks the keys onto the floor; everyone is dismayed.  Frank gets
    a grip, gets quiet, and goes down to get the keys quietly.  As he goes
    to grab the keys, Joanna enters the prison room through the animal
    door.)

         Oops!

    (Joanna begins to chase Frank around the room)

Red:     The keys Frank, give us the keys!!  Frank, over here!!  Give us
         the keys!!  (they disappear behind some junk; Frank emerges riding
         Joanna like a horse with the keys as a bridle) Yeeeeeee-haaaww,
         ride 'em Frank!!!!

Frank:   Ya-hoo, howdy, howdy, howdy!!!!  Howdy, howdy, howdy!!!  (Joanna
         launches Frank across the room) Yeah, yeah, .... (etc) ....

    (Frank drops the keys; Cody picks them up and lets himself out.)

    (Joanna runs after Frank towards the cage) Let me in!  Let me in!!

    (Joanna gets a gun) No, no, no!!!! (etc.)

    (Joanna shoots the gun at Frank who is standing against a wall.  He is
    in a fancy position.)

         Huh, missed.

McLeach: (catching Cody with the keys) Surprise!!  If I didn't know any
         better, I'd think you didn't like it here.

Cody:    Let me go, let go, let go!!!!

McLeach: (sees Frank out of his cage) HA!!  Whaddya you doin' out of your
         cage?!?  (Frank goes back into his cage.) Uhhh.... that's better.
         C'mon boy, (laughs) say goodbye to your little friends.... it's
         the last you'll ever see of 'em.

(scene: at the front of McLeach's hideout)

Bianca:  There is no time to waste.  We MUST try to get in.

Bernard: (handing her a stick) Here, here Miss Bianca, start digging.

Jake:    (half-heartedly digs for a moment, stops, looks up and laughs)
         (sarcastically) Has anyone considered trying... "open sesame"?

Bianca and Bernard:     Aiighh!  Woah!

Jake:    (shocked) Hey it worked!!

    (the mice climb up over the open door and look down.)

McLeach: (throwing Cody out) Get out of here!!  Go on!  Git!!

Bianca:  Look Bernard, it's the boy!

Jake:    And McLeach.

McLeach: (throwing Cody's knife at Cody's feet) It's all over boy... your
         bird's dead.  Someone shot her... shot her, right outta the sky,
         bang!!  (Joanna mocks a shot and death.)

Cody:    NO!!

McLeach: Whaddya mean 'no'?  You callin' me a liar?  I heard it on the
         radio this morning, and she could have been mine if it weren't for
         you, now you better git outta here, before I change my mind.  Go
         on, git!!

Bernard: (whispering) Why is he letting him go??

Jake:    It's gotta be a trick.

McLeach: (aside to Joanna, but loud enough for Cody to hear) Too bad about
         those eggs, eh Joanna?  They'll never survive without their
         mother.  Oh well, survival of the fittest, I guess.  (watches Cody
         run off) (whispers)  Bingo!  (laughs) (Joanna also laughs)

Bianca:  Bird?

Bernard: Eggs?

Jake:    Shh!  Listen.

    (McLeach pulls out his truck with himself and Joanna in the cab.)

McLeach: (laughs) I didn't make it all the way through third grade for
         nothing.

    (McLeach's truck begins to leave.)

Jake:    I don't know where he's going, but he can't let him get away.
         Hurry up you two!! (he jumps onto the truck.)

Bianca:  Quickly Bernard, NOW!!

    (They all jump; Bianca and Bernard miss and slide down onto the treads)

Bernard: Oh no!! Oh no!!  Get between the treads!!

Jake:    (throwing a rope) Bernard!! Bianca!!  Here, catch!!

Bernard: Got it!!  Miss, Miss, Miss Bianca, you, you can do it!!!

(scene: in the sky)

Wilbur:  (panting and puffing)  Boy, this is some headwind, huh?  Say,
         (laughs), you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen two little mice
         running around down there, would ya?  Hey where ya going?  I mean
         it, I'm looking for two little mice!  (aside) Is it something I
         said?

(scene: at the cliff)

    (Cody runs to the edge, stops, looks down, and begins to climb down.)

Jake:    He's going down the cliff!  C'mon, we gotta warn him!

(scene:  over the cliff; at Marahute's nest.)

    (Cody arrives at the nest; sees the eggs; checks them out; he covers
    them up, and places one of the golden feathers on them.)

Bianca:  Cody!

Cody:    Huh?  Who are you?

Bianca:  Oh, there is no time to explain, you're in GREAT danger.

Cody:    (Marahute's screech is heard at a distance) Marahute?!  It can't be!

Bianca:  Oh Cody, Cody wait!!

Cody:    (sees Marahute) She's alive!!

Bianca:  Cody please!!  You MUST listen!!

Bernard: That's right, Mc.. McLeach is on the cliff.

Cody:    (looks up and sees McLeach's truck) (begins to yell and plead)
         Marahute, NO!!!  Turn back!!  Turn back!!  Stay away!!  It's a
         trap!!

    (McLeach launches the trap; Marahute is caught in it.)

McLeach: I got her!!!  I got her!!!  Did you see that?  (laughs)  Perfect
         shot!! Per-fect shot!  She's mine!!  (laughs)  All mine!!!!

Cody:    NO!!!

    (Cody jumps for the trap/bundle as it is hoisted up; Jake lassos Cody's
    foot.)

Jake:    Hold tight you two, we're going for a ride!

    (Bernard misses the rope)

Bernard: Bianca!!

Bianca:  Bernard!

    (Cody begins to cut the ropes on the trap.)

McLeach: (grumbles)... Meddlin' brat.  Gonna get rid of him for good.

    (McLeach tries to shake Cody off.)

Cody:    Help I'm slipping!

Bianca:  Cody, don't move!!

    (Jake throws a rope and lassos Cody's foot.)

McLeach: (hoists the whole group up and drops them into his cage) (laughs)
         (whispering)  There she is Joanna.... just look at her.... look at
         the size of her... the RAREST bird in the world.  That bird's
         gonna make me rich... (chuckles) FILTHY rich.  (laughs)
         (announcing) I got what I want.  Now, what does Joanna want?  Does
         she wanna make sure that bird... STAYS rare?  (egging her on) How
         about some great, big, triple A, jumbo, eagle eggs!!!  Eh?!  You
         want 'em?!  Eh?!  You want 'em?  Go get 'em girl!!

Cody:    NO!!  Please!!

    (Joanna runs for the cliff, sees how far down it is and balks in fear.)

McLeach: (mocking) Why, whatever is the matter Joanna??  (She points down;
         McLeach kicks her over the edge).  Git!!

    (Joanna goes down to eat the eggs; she searches the nest for them; finds
    the eggs; takes a bite of one; it is rock hard; she tries another with
    the same result; she drops one egg on the other which lands on her tail
    and she shreiks in pain)

         (screaming from on top of cliff)  JOANNA!!  You hurry up and eat
         those eggs and get your tail up here!  MOVE IT!!

    (Joanna moves the "eggs" to the edge; knocks them over the cliff with
    her tail; she yanks on the rope for McLeach to bring he up; as she does,
    another rock falls that looks like an egg; Bernard comes out of hiding.)

Bernard: (to the eggs) O.k. you guys, she fell for it.  Looks like the
         coast is clear.

Wilbur:  (flying in to Marahute's nest)  Girls?  Girls, I'm here! (laughs)
         Where are you, you little chickees you?  (laugh)

Bernard: (puzzled at first)  Wilbur?  (louder) Wilbur!

Wilbur:  (screams and falls off the edge) Don't EVER do that to me again!
         Oh... boy... I lost a lot of feathers on that one.

Bernard: Wilbur am I glad to see you!  Give me a hand with these eggs will
         ya? (rolling the eggs out of hiding.)

Wilbur:  Yeah, sure.  Wait a minute.... what the heck are you doing up here
         anyway??

Bernard: The kidnapper took the boy and Jake.... Miss Bianca.

Wilbur:  Miss Bianca??  Miss Bianca's in trouble?!?  Woah!  Geez!  That's
         terrible!  We gotta do something!  (chastising) Bernard, I'm
         disappointed in you.  Hidin' under a nest while Miss Bianca needs
         our help.  I gotta talk to you mister...

Bernard: Wilbur....

Wilbur:  (fumbling) You should start searchin' the desert for her, and
         (fumbling) I'll scan the coastline!

Bernard: Wilbur...

Wilbur:  That's what I'll do....  I'll ask the chicks on the beach.

Bernard: Wilbur!

Wilbur:  Huh?  What?!

Bernard: Now listen!  (Bernard points to the eggs) There's some chicks
         right here that need your help.

Wilbur:  Really?  (Bernard sits on an egg, and pats it.)  Oh no.... wait a
         minute... hold it.... I know what you're thinkin' and you're
         wrong.  Don't even.... no... (Bernard gives him a stare) don't
         look at me like that!  You're gettin' no from me!  You understand?
         No!  I will not.. EVER sit on those eggs!

         (scene changes to Wilbur sitting on the eggs)  Aww... nuts!
         (sigh)... (to himself) Gotta learn to be more assertive.  No is no
         is NO.  (to the eggs) Hey, quit movin' in there!

(scene:  McLeach's vehicle)

McLeach: Well Joanna, it looks like lady luck has finally decided to smile
         on us.  Everything's going our way.  (laughs to himself).

Cody:    (screaming) You can't do this!!  You're gonna get in big trouble!!
         I'll tell the rangers where you are!!

McLeach: (groan) I almost forgot...we got a loose end to tie up, haven't we
         girl?

    (Joanna looks through the back window; makes a face at Cody; Cody makes
    on back and smacks the glass and scares Joanna)

Bianca:  (consoling) Now, now Cody, we mustn't loose hope.  Bernard is
         still out there...

Jake:    (mocking sincerity) That's right!  Is anyone can get us out of
         this scrape it's old Berno!  (aside) Nice bluff, Miss B.

Bianca:  I wasn't bluffing.  You don't know Bernard like I do.  He'll never
         give up.  (looking back out over the trail)

(scene:  Bernard on the trail of McLeach's truck.)

    (Bernard is seen running along the trail of McLeach's truck; after
    turning a "corner" he realizes just how far he has to go; he sighs in
    disbelief).

Bernard: Oh my gosh!

    (He hears a sound; there is a razorback right next to him sleeping;
    Bernard looks scared at first; thinks; gets an idea; builds up courage;
    and goes for it.)

         Ahem... ahem.... ah... excuse me... (the razorback wakes up and
         grunts at him) (assertively) now look, I've got a long way to go,
         (Bernard roughs up the razorback by the snout) you're going to
         take me there, and you're not going to give me any trouble about
         it, right?  (the razorback whimpers and shakes his head no.)
         Good.  (Bernard climbs up the razorback) Now git. (they take off
         down the trail).

(scene: Crocodile falls)

McLeach: (Cody has been tied up to a hoist and hook) Are ya ready boy?
         It's time you learned how to fish for crocs! (laughs) They like it
         when you use live bait... and you're as live as they come.
         (laughs and sings as he adjusts a light onto Cody so that the
         crocodiles can see him)  Oh... you get a line, and I'll get a
         pole, matey.... you get a line, I'll get a pole, friend.... oh,
         you get a line, I'll get a pole, we'll go fishin' at the crocodile
         hole, buddy, pal o' mine.... (to the crocs)  That's right babies,
         suppertime!  (continues to sing as Cody is lowered to the water.)

Jake:    It don't look good Miss B.  I can't see any way out of this one.

Bianca:  (to the air) Oh Bernard, please hurry!

McLeach: (laughing/singing) Now, this is MY idea of FUN.  (begins to play
         with the hoist controls; dunks Cody in the water and pulls him
         out.)  Nothing personal boy, but I wouldn't want to disappoint the
         rangers.  They was looking so hard for ya, and now... they're
         gonna find ya!  (drops Cody once more, but before Cody hits the
         water, the power goes out.)

         What the blazes going on here?  (McLeach looks down over truck;
         sees a razorback running out of the truck cab).

         Joanna?  (McLeach climbs down) Did you know, there was a razorback
         in my truck?  (she shakes her head yes at first) Did ya?  Did ya??
         (she shakes he head no) (yelling)  There was a RAZORBACK in my
         truck.  Now you quit playing around and do your job, you four-
         legged python!!  (She climbs down to look around)

         (McLeach looks inside the truck cab.)  Hey, what happened to them
         keys?  (fishing around the floor; Bernard is hiding underneath the
         gas pedal with the keys.)  Must be around here somewhere, they
         couldn't just get up and walk away.  Something weird's going on
         around here.... I smell a big, fat rat.


    (Cody is still hanging just above the water; the crocodiles jump for
    him; Bernard jumps out of the truck cab with the keys; he tiptoes
    underneath the truck; Joanna follows him and then chases him.)

Bianca:  Look, it's Bernard!

Jake:    I don't believe it!  Way to go mate!

Bernard: Miss Bianca, Jake, catch!!  (He throws the keys up to them)

         (Joanna chases after him) Woah!

McLeach: Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat. (getting out his
         gun) (laughs)

    (Jake and Bianca work the keys up the cage)

    (Joanna continues to chase Bernard; Bernard tricks Joanna into biting
    her tail; he hides in a log; Bianca and Jake continue to work the keys
    up the cage; a gunshot is heard; Marahute screeches.)

McLeach: Blasted!!

Bernard: Oh my gosh!  I hope I know what I'm doing!

    (another shot goes off;  this time, it hits the rope and severs it most
    of the way; Bernard kicks Joanna; runs for McLeach.)

         Thhpppt.

    (Bernard runs up McLeach just as he takes aim again; Joanna follows and
    tackles McLeach.)

McLeach: Hey, get off me!!  Joanna!  What are ya.....

    (Bernard pushes McLeach over with one finger) (screams and falls into
    the water)

         Joanna!  Joanna!!  You stupid rodent!  Get off me!  You idiot!
         Get off of me!  No!  No!  (begins to beat away crocodiles with his
         gun.)

    (the rope breaks and Cody falls into the water)

Bianca:  Bernard the boy!!

    (Bernard dives into the water to get Cody; they both surface.)

Cody:    Help!!  Help!!

    (Bernard swims for shore; he ties Cody's rope around a tree limb.)

McLeach: (hitting the crocodiles) Get back, get back, go on, get away from
         me, get away from me.... (the crocs retreat) (laughs) HA!  I
         whooped ya!  I whooped ya all!  You'll think twice before messin'
         with Percival C. McLeach!! (laughs)  Woah!  (realizes that he is
         headed for the waterfall and tries to swim back; Joanna waves
         goodbye) NOO!!!! (McLeach goes over the edge of the waterfall.)

Bernard: Don't give up Cody!!

    (the tree limb breaks; Bernard and Cody continue down the river; Jake
    opens the lock on their cage; Marahute takes off with Jake and Bianca.)

Jake:    Hop on Miss B.!!

    (they fly towards Cody)

Cody:    Help!  Help! (Cody goes over the waterfall with Bernard)

    (everyone disappears into the mist of the waterfall; a few seconds
    later, we see all four on Marahute flying away triumphantly into the sky
    and clouds.)

Cody:    (mocks eagle screech)  (looking around; sees Bernard clinging to
         the rope.)  It's o.k.  Come on.... (to Bernard) Thanks little
         mate.

Bianca:  (hugging Bernard) Oh Bernard you are magnificent, you are
         absolutely the hero of the day.

Bernard: (rushed) Miss Bianca, before anything else happens... (sighs; gets
         out the ring and gets on one knee).... will you marry me?

Bianca:  (shocked) Bernard!  Of COURSE, I will!  (hugs Bernard.)

Jake:    Well done mate. (Jake gives Bernard the thumbs up sign.)

Cody:    Come on Marahute, let's all go home.

    (Marhute flies higher and the four of them cruise off into the clouds
    and the moon.)

(scene: high on the cliff at Marahute's nest)

Wilbur:  Help!!!  Anybody!!  Bernard!!  Bianca!!  Where are you?!?  (to
         himself)  O.k., that's it, I'm outta here, this is ridiculous.
         You can't leave me here alone (laughs).  I'm gone!  I am GONE!
         (the sound of eggs breaking open and chirping is heard) (to the
         eggs) Aww no... stay in those eggs!  That's a direct order!  (in a
         baby-ish voice) Awww..... hey... you're kind of a cute little
         feller, coochy coochy.... YOW! WOAH!!! (groans)

          Revenge is an act of passion; vengeance of justice.

                         
           - Samuel Johnson
                         
                         
                         
                         
           Based on a true story



                         
                         FADE IN:
                         
                         
          EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING
                         
          ANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp...
          clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on
          an otherwise barren tree.
                         
          A gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down,
          landing in the slow current of the Missouri. The last leaf
          of the fall, taking its final journey south.
                         
          As it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the
          current, all we can hear is the river's gentle movement...
          the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until
          DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but
          growing louder... LAUGHTER... SINGING.
                         
          And then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A
          BOAT. We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... MEN'S VOICES, as we
          rise up the bow... see it's a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR
          at the center of the river.
                         
          Beyond the flatboat are the voices... TWENTY MEN of the Rocky
          Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling
          wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for
          makeshift rooftops. And this camp is full of life because
          these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched
          wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for
          them to claim their share.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - EVENING
                         
          CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (late 20's), dressed in a buckskin
          jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around
          his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. He
          stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to
          be a member of some exclusive club. He pulls off one of his
          gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm.
                         
          From across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid and
          thick... dark eyes of a killer, watches Henry. He nudges
          MACE BOONE, (40's), a thief in a previous life.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Likely got a splinter. Can't
           figure what to do without Mama here
           to pull it out for him.
                         
          Boone chuckles... spits in Henry's direction.
           2.
                         
                          BOONE
           Need a doc, Captain?
                         
          Henry looks up... sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him.
          He slides his glove back on.
                         
                          HENRY
           Gather more wood.
                         
          Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an
          exaggerated salute.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (under his breath)
           Shame my Pap was a broken down
           drunk. Else he could've bought me
           a Captain's job too.
                         
          Boone snickers. Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch,
          easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           We got a plan for these fires,
           Captain, or are we roastin' berries
           all the way up to Fort Union?
                         
                          HENRY
           Glass and the others will be back
           with some game, Fitzgerald. Just
           make sure you have the fires ready.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           My supper's in the hands of a
           hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy.
           Hell, my belly feels full already.
                         
          Fitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does,
          we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING
                         
          And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN
          ANSTADT RIFLE.
                         
          The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the
          face of HUGH GLASS, (40's), African-American, one eye still
          closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass!
           3.
                         
          Glass lowers the rifle, as PIG GILMORE, (30's), fat and
          filthy, races past.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           Square as a barn door.
                         
          JIM BRIDGER, (17), young eyes that have already seen a lot,
          nods to Glass as he follows Pig.
                         
          Glass watches Pig and Bridger trot through the trees to a
          fallen ELK. Glass walks calmly after them, graceful in this
          world... his rifle so comfortable in his hand it's like he
          was born with it there. Pig crouches over the dead elk...
          grins up at Glass.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           Right where you said he'd be.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           But bigger than we figured. Gonna
           be a load to haul back to camp.
                         
                          PIG
           Have to split it up I reckon.
                         
                          GLASS
           Yep. Bridger'll take the tail, and
           Pig you haul the rest.
                         
          And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow,
          because he just nods... pulls out his knife to cut the tail
          off for Bridger.
                         
          Bridger and Glass exchange a smile... until Glass notices
          something... steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the
          ground beside it. He runs a finger over the dirt... touches
          a broken twig.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Another one close by?
                         
          Glass doesn't answer... studies the track... feels the nearby
          brush... inhales the scent from his hand. Bridger and Pig
          watch him... exchange a confused glance. And then in a flash
          of movement, Glass is on his feet, racing away.
                         
                          PIG
           Hugh?
                         
          Glass just keeps running. Pig and Bridger chase after him.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           4.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - EVENING
                         
          The men building fires... laughing... enjoying themselves.
          Boone on the outskirts, gathering branches.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS - TEARING THROUGH THE WOODS...
                         
          ...dodging trees... leaping over fallen logs... loading his
          Anstadt as he runs.
                         
                         
          BRIDGER AND PIG - CHASING AFTER GLASS...
                         
          ...but not as gracefully. Pig trips... slams to the
          ground... scrambles back to his feet to continue on.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          BOONE - CARRYING AN ARMLOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP...
                         
          ...seeing other men playing cards. He stops along the edge
          of camp, drops the wood to the ground.
                         
                          BOONE
           No rule says I'm the only one
           that's gotta gather this shit.
                         
          The other men don't even notice. Then an ARROW WHIZZES
          THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone... THWACK... it hits him in
          the back of the neck... erupts out the front of his throat.
                         
          Boone stands frozen... confused... reaches up and grabs the
          bloody arrow... finally drops to his knees. And that's when
          a TRAPPER looks up... sees Boone on his knees, holding that
          arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish.
                         
          AND BEYOND BOONE ARE FORTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH
          THE TREES... FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR
          SHAVED HEADS... FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE.
                         
                          TRAPPER
           `REE!
                         
          WHOOSH... AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER'S CHEST, sending
          him flying backward. The camp explodes into chaos... men
          YELLING... grabbing for weapons... stumbling over each other
          as they duck behind trees.
           5.
                         
                         
          HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT...
                         
          ...taking aim at the attacking figures.
                         
          The Arikara pour into camp, arrows flying... knives and
          hatchets swinging. And this is a massacre... the Arikara
          wading through the trappers... stabbing... clubbing...
          scalping. This once peaceful world is filled with a sickening
          mix of war cries and screams of death.
                         
          Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log... aims his rifle...
          BOOM... takes down one of the warriors. He starts reloading
          as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him... draws back his knife.
          Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn't going to make
          it in time... the warrior leaps toward him...
                         
          ...BOOM... it's like the warrior hits an invisible wall...
          flies back to the ground, very dead. Fitzgerald spins...
          sees Glass and his Anstadt right behind him.
                         
                          GLASS
           GET TO THE BOAT!
                         
          Fitzgerald takes off... flips his rifle around, swings it
          like a club across a warrior's head... WHACK!
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
                          (TO HENRY)
           THE BOAT, CAPTAIN!
                         
          Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water. An arrow drives
          into the trapper's leg... he goes down. Henry lifts the man
          to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in
          the man's back... he falls limp. Henry FIRES HIS PISTOLS,
          dropping the WARRIOR.
                         
          Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING
          back at the attacking Arikara. The water deepens, and they
          start swimming toward the flatboat.
                         
          ARROWS HISS into the water all around them.
                         
          Glass is still in the shallows... aims his pistol... BAM...
          shoots an oncoming warrior... spins after the other men...
          joins them as they near the flatboat.
                         
          A final TRAPPER charges down the shore behind them. SEVERAL
          WARRIORS pursue him.
                         
                          TRAPPER
           WAIT!
           6.
                         
          He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs... pulls the
          trigger... CLICK... pulls it again... CLICK. But he's too
          scared to stop his finger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...
          THUD... as a hatchet buries in his back. He crashes face
          first into the shallows.
                         
          The Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into
          his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck,
          straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by
          the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to
          Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY.
                         
          Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start
          scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the
          wooden boat.
                         
          Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger
          as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back
          into the river. Bridger flails in the water... watches the
          warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass
          SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's
          head.
                         
          The Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs
          Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Thank you.
                         
          But Glass is already gone... FIRING BACK AT THE ARIKARA, as
          the current carries them away.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           HEY!
                         
          Pig looks over the side... sees a frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON
          gripped to the edge. Pig pulls him onto the boat.
                         
          Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES... shove them against the
          river's bottom to pick up speed.
                         
          Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk's Tongue yanks a DYING
          TRAPPER's head back by his hair to peel away his scalp.
                         
          Henry drops his eyes... can't watch. The TRAPPER'S SCREAM
          ECHOES OVER HIM.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER
                         
          Quiet and dark... the battle long over. The flatboat floats
          with the gentle current. The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are
          scattered around the deck...
           7.
          Glass digging an arrow out of WALLACE MURPHY'S SHOULDER...
          Fitzgerald poling on one side with Anderson on the other...
          STUBBY BILL VANCE and Pig standing patrol with their
          rifles... Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED TRAPPER... and
          Henry standing at the front of the flatboat, staring off
          blankly.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           What's the plan, Captain?
                         
          Henry's still lost in those screams.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Captain! What the hell do we do
           now?
                         
          Henry snaps out of his stare... turns to the men... obviously
          doesn't have an answer.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           We're just floatin' farther from
           Fort Union.
                         
          Henry's eyes instinctively look to Glass.
                         
                          GLASS
           The Missouri's no good. Not if the
           `Ree's running it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           So we just float the hell down to
           Mexico or wherever else this river
           takes us?
                         
                          GLASS
           We get ourselves safe outta range,
           then track another course up.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Add weeks to the trip.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Better that than endin' up scalped
           on the side of the river.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (shoving him away)
           Shut up, kid, you don't get no say
           in this.
                         
          Bridger starts to respond, but Fitzgerald's angry glare stops
          him.
           8.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           (back to Henry)
           And in case you hadn't noticed,
           Captain, we're twelve men short of
           what we were.
           (off the badly wounded
                          TRAPPER)
           Thirteen before long.
                         
                          HENRY
           I understand our situation, Mr.
           Fitzgerald. We do like Glass
           said... put some distance between
           us and the Arikara, then chart a
           course to Fort Union.
                         
          Fitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH... rolls those dark eyes
          to Anderson. Glass gives Henry a nod.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT
                         
          ANGLE ON THE BADLY WOUNDED TRAPPER... NOW DEAD...
                         
          ...as hands push the body over the side of the boat. It
          splashes into the water... floats downstream.
                         
          We PULL BACK... see that the flatboat is beached along the
          bank of the river. Glass and Pig watch the body drift away.
                         
                          PIG
           Reckon it's better `an lettin' the
           `Ree find him... take his ears...
           slice what's left all to shit.
                         
          Glass nods... steps down off the boat to Henry and the
          others. They're gathered around a map spread out on the
          ground. Henry runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE.
                         
                          HENRY
           So we hike west to the Grand, then
           follow it up to Fort Union.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           On foot? You got any idea how long
           that's gonna take? It'll be winter
           before we get there.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Unless we come across a post...
           trade for some horses.
           9.
                         
                          GLASS
           No posts that far out.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           So if we do this, we do every step
           with our own feet.
                         
                          HENRY
           We make camp here for the night,
           then load supplies and head out for
           the Grand at first light.
                          (BEAT)
           And gather extra blankets `cause
           there won't be any fires.
                         
          More GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson, as they move
          toward the cover of trees. Bridger walks up beside Glass.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Thank you... for what you done back
           there.
                         
                          GLASS
           You'd have done the same for me.
                         
          Bridger nods... he hopes so.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          Pig on watch... sitting at the base of a tree, rifle across
          his lap, eyes wide, scanning the darkness. All clear. He
          peers back to camp... Fitzgerald, Anderson, Stubby Bill, and
          Murphy wrapped in blankets... passing a bottle of whiskey
          around. Bridger across from Fitzgerald, poking at the dirt
          with a stick. Henry is off to one side, still studying that
          map. Glass sits against a tree, cleaning his Anstadt rifle.
                         
          Fitzgerald watches Glass a beat, then...
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You treat that Anstadt sweeter than
           any woman, Glass.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Never seen a woman that could stop
           a `Ree from three hundred feet.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I knew a particular big-breasted
           redhead in Boston that might come
           close.
           10.
                         
          The others manage a small laugh. Glass just keeps working on
          that rifle.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Bring it over here for me to have a
           look.
                         
          Glass doesn't look up... wipes a rag down the barrel.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Did you hear what I said, boy?
                         
          Still nothing from Glass. And Fitzgerald doesn't like
          that... the tension's growing.
                         
                          BRIDGER
                          (MUMBLING)
           You seen it before.
                         
          Fitzgerald turns that mean, drunken glare on Bridger.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           What'd you say, kid?
                         
          Bridger hesitates a beat... until the other men's eyes force
          a response.
                         
                          BRIDGER
                          (SOFTLY)
           I said you shoulda already got a
           look when he saved you with it
           earlier.
                         
          The camp falls still... nobody talks to Fitzgerald like
          that... especially when he's drunk. There isn't a sound
          except for Glass working methodically on his rifle...
                         
          ...until the SWISH OF BLADE OVER LEATHER, as Fitzgerald tears
          the blade from his belt... flings it into the dirt between
          Bridger's legs... AN INCH BELOW HIS CROTCH.
                         
          Fitzgerald stares at Bridger, daring him to react. But
          Bridger's too scared... doesn't, so Fitzgerald just smiles.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You're lucky you ain't a man yet.
           (off the blade)
           Else that mighta nicked somethin'.
                         
          A few NERVOUS CHUCKLES from the others, hoping this is over.
          And it is, because Fitzgerald reaches over and pulls the
          knife away... cleans the dirty blade on Bridger's leg.
           11.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And unlike you, I don't need savin'
           by him or nobody else. Remember
           that.
                         
          Fitzgerald stands... wobbles just a bit. He slides the knife
          back into his belt, then steadies his drunken gaze on Glass.
                         
          The others exchange nervous glances... uh-oh.
                         
          Fitzgerald walks to Glass... snaps his fingers for Glass'
          Anstadt.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Lemme see what's so special `bout
           that shooter of yours.
                         
          Nothing from Glass, so Fitzgerald grabs the barrel, but Glass
          holds firm.
                         
                          GLASS
           Middle of workin' on it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Well you can stop workin' on it,
           and let me have a look like I said.
                         
          Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass' grip only grows
          tighter. His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he
          isn't giving up his rifle. And they hold that stare just as
          hard as they're holding Glass' rifle.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You forget your place?
                         
                          GLASS
           Best I can tell, my place is right
           where I want it... on the smart end
           of my rifle.
                         
          Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he's holding is aimed right at
          his stomach, while Glass' hand seems suddenly very close to
          the trigger. But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't
          let him lose this tug of war.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I'd be careful if I was you, boy.
                         
          And this thing's about to turn real ugly... until...
                         
                          HENRY
           That's enough, Fitzgerald. Go
           sober up and get to sleep.
                          (MORE)
           12.
                          HENRY(CONT'D)
           If you're passed out when we break
           camp tomorrow, I leave you here.
                         
          Fitzgerald holds his glare on Glass, then releases the rifle,
          shoving it back at Glass. He glances to Henry, and throws
          back a big gulp from the bottle just for spite, before
          backing away from Glass.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           That's the trouble with this part
           of the world. No mirrors. Niggers
           forget what color they are.
                         
          Glass ignores Fitzgerald... goes back to his rifle.
          Fitzgerald tosses the bottle at Anderson, then jerks his
          blanket up... walks off to sleep by himself.
                         
          Glass glances up from his work... just long enough to give
          Bridger a nod.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - LATER
                         
          Fitzgerald sleeping off that whiskey. The others snoring in
          a cluster at the center of the camp. Henry lies there
          awake... looks across to Glass, still sitting against the
          tree, a HANDRAWN MAP in his lap, as his eyes pierce the
          darkness. Henry eases over to Glass.
                         
                          HENRY
           Can't sleep either?
                         
                          GLASS
           Never like closin' my eyes when I'm
           not sure who'll be standin' over me
           when I open `em.
                         
                          HENRY
           I keep thinking about Boone and the
           others... how maybe I should've had
           us make camp further up river.
                         
                          GLASS
           The tracks I saw... those `Ree had
           been tailin' us for a while. They'd
           have gone as far north as it took.
                          (BEAT)
           You're a good man, Captain. Soon
           as you realize that, these others
           will too.
                         
          Henry likes hearing that... still isn't sure it's true.
           13.
                         
                          HENRY
           Your years trappin' and guidin' out
           here... have you had much
           experience with the Arikara?
                         
                          GLASS
           Enough to try and stay outta their
           way.
                         
                          HENRY
           (motions to Glass' map)
           But you know this country well
           enough to get us past them... up to
           Fort Union?
                         
                          GLASS
           I been here a long while. Whether
           that gets us to Union or not...
                         
          Henry waits for more... doesn't get it. So he just nods and
          starts back to his blanket.... stops.
                         
                          HENRY
           What Fitzgerald said earlier... he
           doesn't speak for the rest.
                         
                          GLASS
           He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's
           what I prefer about this country...
           it's got no eye for the color of a
           man's skin.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (BEAT)
           Try to get some sleep, Hugh.
                         
          Henry climbs back under his blanket. Glass just sits there
          looking at the map.
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS' MAP...
                         
          ...primitive at best. Sketched mountains... winding blue
          lines for rivers... small dots are scattered about with names
          beside them... "Brazeau", "Talbot", "Union". And DOZENS OF
          TRIANGLE PINE TREES have been drawn, representing the endless
          wilderness.
                         
          We TIGHTEN ON THOSE TRIANGLES until we're lost in them.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
           14.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Thick with trees. Henry leads the men single file through
          the woods. They each have a canvas sack of supplies over one
          shoulder, and their rifle in their hands.
                         
          The only sound is their feet crunching the dried leaves, and
          even that seems too loud as their eyes dart about, searching
          for any sign of attack.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by
           now?
                         
                          HENRY
           We'll reach it soon enough. Glass
           said to keep this course.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Glass said. Too bad I don't see
           him.
                         
                          PIG
           That's on account he's up ahead
           makin' sure it's clear, and you get
           to keep your ears.
                         
          Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Or he's run off and left us.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           He wouldn't do that.
                         
          Fitzgerald GRUNTS... doesn't believe that.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           My bet, that nigger's used to
           runnin'.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - DAY
                         
          Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding...
          subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves...
          careful not to leave his scent behind. And his eyes cut
          through the trees as he moves... digging for any sign of
          movement.
                         
          He spots something at his feet... crouches down, running his
          finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt.
           15.
                         
          O.S. RUSTLING snaps his head up... to the TREMBLING OF
          BUSHES... growing harder... whatever's in there is coming
          toward Glass. He calmly raises his rifle... presses the
          stock firmly against his shoulder... closes one eye as he
          takes steady aim down the long barrel...
                         
          ...to the shapes rumbling out of the brush... TWO BEAR CUBS
          playfully wrestling.
                         
          Glass lowers the Anstadt... looks past the cubs for something
          else... but the woods are empty. A SUDDEN FEAR FILLS GLASS'
          EYES...
                         
          ...he spins... right into the GIANT GRIZZLY SWINGING ITS PAW
          AT HIM... hitting him across the side of the neck. The
          animal's razor claws tear into Glass' throat, as the force
          sends him flying through the air.
                         
          Glass sails into a thick tree... the CRACK OF HIS LEG
          SNAPPING against the trunk. The rifle falls from his hand.
          The Grizzly lets out a massive ROAR... charges Glass. Glass
          crawls to the Anstadt... grabs it... has just enough time to
          tilt the rifle toward the bear... BOOM.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          HENRY - HEARING THE BLAST.
                         
                          HENRY
           UP AHEAD!
                         
          Henry takes off at full sprint. The other men follow.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS - AS THE BEAR LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM...
                         
          ...tosses Glass aside with a powerful swing. Glass hits the
          ground with a PAINFUL THUD. He starts CRAWLING AWAY, pulling
          the KNIFE from his belt as the bear rises up like a giant
          behind him... swings... tears its claws across Glass's back,
          shredding deep into his flesh.
                         
          Glass is fighting for his life now... flailing with the
          knife... slicing it across the bear's paw as it whips past
          him. The wound slows the bear enough for Glass to start
          crawling again.
                         
          But the Grizzly doesn't give Glass the chance... ROARS... is
          on him in a flash, a BLUR OF CLAWS AND FANGS... tearing
          across Glass' head... ripping into his face... his chest.
           16.
                         
          Glass drives his knife into the bear again... deep... trying
          to tear through the layers of flesh to something more vital.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          HENRY - LEADING THE CHARGE THROUGH THE FOREST.

          GLASS AND THE GRIZZLY - FIGHTING THIS EPIC BATTLE...
                         
          ...locked in a death grip... tumbling along the ground...
          trading violent blows... Glass' blade versus the Grizzly's
          claws and fangs... snapping small trees as they roll over
          them... toward the edge of a steep embankment...
                         
          ... and ROLL DOWN... spinning over and over... each ROARING
          AT THE OTHER... Glass pounding the knife into the bear again
          and again as they fall... neither willing to surrender as
          they careen down the slope at a dizzying pace, then SLAM TO
          THE BOTTOM WITH A CRUNCH. And the forest falls still...
          Glass hidden somewhere beneath the massive animal... both
          deathly motionless.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - DAY
                         
          Bridger's the first to reach the battleground... sees the TWO
          FRIGHTENED BEAR CUBS SCURRY AWAY. He follows the bloody
          ground and crushed underbrush to the top of the slope...
          looks down to the mass of flesh at the bottom.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Christ Almighty.
                         
          Henry, Pig, and the others reach the edge.
                         
                          HENRY
           Glass!
                         
          No answer. And all they can see is the bear, so they scan
          the trees.
                         
                          PIG
           HUGH!
                         
          Still nothing. So Bridger takes off down the slope... losing
          his balance but rolling back to his feet. He reaches the
          bear... sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.
           17.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           He's down here!
                         
          Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the
          other men scramble down. But Bridger can't budge the massive
          carcass... not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in... shove the
          animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass...
                         
          ...his throat is torn wide open... scalp peeled back from
          just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull... stomach and
          chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. His right leg
          is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the skin.
                         
          Bridger's legs give out... he drops to a knee and vomits.
                         
                          MURPHY
           Oh, Jesus.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           He's tore to pieces.
                         
          The men stare down at Glass' corpse.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Least he took that Grizz down with
           him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Wished he'da done it without firing
           his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree
           around before, there will be now.
                         
          And that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they
          roll to the ground. And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top,
          raining punches down on Pig... turning his face into a bloody
          mess.
                         
          Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald... drag him off.
                         
                          HENRY
           THAT'S ENOUGH!
                         
          Then somehow, GLASS GASPS... this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Holy Christ, he's alive.
                         
          Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. Glass
          looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and
          pain. His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE... bubbles
          forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp.
           18.
                         
                          HENRY
           Get me some water.
                         
          Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. Henry empties it over
          Glass' throat... his face and scalp. The water hits the
          wounds and immediately transforms to blood.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Oh, Jesus... Jesus.
                         
          Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat... feels the
          gaping wound. His eyes widen in horror. He COUGHS... the
          air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat.
                         
                          HENRY
           It's okay, Hugh.
           (pushing Glass' hand away)
           You're going to be fine.
                         
          Henry spins his head away from Glass.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           I need some rags before he bleeds
           out.
                         
          Pig whips a shirt from his bag... shreds it.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           And your whiskey.
                         
          Pig tosses a bottle to Henry. Henry pours it over the
          gashes. The BURNING PAIN arches Glass... he CRIES OUT in
          that same horrific moan.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit.
                         
          Bridger throws his weight against Glass' shoulders.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           The rest of you spread out... scout
           a circle around us. Fitzgerald,
           you and Anderson take west and
           north. Murphy and Mike south and
           east. Watch for anyone that
           might've heard that shot.
                         
          And for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men...
          firm... in complete control... just as Glass said he would
          be. So the men hurry off to their positions.
           19.
                         
                          PIG
           What about me, Cap?
                         
                          HENRY
           Get down here and help me tie off
           these wounds best we can.
                         
          Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds. The blood
          keeps seeping out, soaking the rags.
                         
                          PIG
           It won't stop bleedin'.
                         
                          HENRY
           Shut up, Pig.
                          (TO GLASS)
           We're fixing you up, Hugh.
                         
          Glass is like a shredded rag doll... dazed eyes staring up at
          them as they work on his wounds... wrapping the rags around
          his throat... laying his scalp back over his skull, and tying
          another rag around it and under his jaw to hold it in place.
                         
          Bridger wipes the blood from Glass' face.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass.
                         
          Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over
          his knees... oozing out from beneath Glass.
                         
                          HENRY
           Roll him over... easy.
                         
          They gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED,
          GASHES running across the width of Glass' back. Henry stares
          at the open flesh, ready to panic again... but he doesn't.
          Instead he looks to Pig.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Get me the kit. We need to stitch
           his back up.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What about the rest of him?
                         
                          HENRY
           He's losing more blood back here.
           (off the throat)
           And I don't know what to do with
           that yet.
           20.
                         
          Pig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread...
          hands it to Henry. Henry grabs the whiskey bottle.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry for how this is about to
           burn, Hugh.
                         
          Henry pours the whiskey over Glass' back. And the pain must
          be excruciating, because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Fitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees.
          Glass' scream erupts through the trees, and they both
          immediately crouch down to a knee... out of sight to anyone
          out there that might have heard that.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           They're torturin' the poor bastard.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           And riskin' gettin' us killed in
           the process. Proper thing would be
           to end it for him quick.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           `Less he could pull through.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You seen what that grizz did to
           him. Shit, Glass'll be dead inside
           a hour. We all will be if he keeps
           screamin' like that.

          HENRY, BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS... Bridger and Pig
          pressing Glass' scalp down, as Henry slides the needle and
          thread through the skin, suturing the wound.
                         
          HENRY CLEANING GLASS' SHREDDED THROAT.
                         
          BRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING THE SCREAMING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY
          SNAPS GLASS' LEG BACK IN PLACE.
           21.
                         
          FITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES... to Henry
          doctoring Glass. Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger...
          turns back to the darkening forest.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - EVENING
                         
          Glass rests unconscious on the ground. Two branches act as a
          splint on his leg. A blanket covers his body... his face is
          like a swollen, disfigured, Frankenstein's monster...
          stitches of black thread holding it in place.
                         
          Henry crouches a short distance away from him, rinsing his
          hands under a canteen. Bridger and Pig stand beside him.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What now?
                         
                          HENRY
           We wait. Does he have any kin you
           know of?
                         
                          PIG
           He keeps to hisself. Never
           mentioned none.
                         
                          HENRY
           Go get the others. Tell `em we're
           making camp here for the night.
                         
          Pig starts hustling away.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           And gather some wood, but make sure
           it's dry. We don't want much smoke
           when we cook that grizzly.
                         
                         
          ANGLE ON THE MASSIVE BEAR...
                         
          ...lying dead on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with
          blood... Glass' blood.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          And what's left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs
          of flesh butchered from its skeleton.
                         
          A fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts
          above the flame. The men sit around the fire...
           22.
          Murphy reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast,
          tossing it in his mouth. The men are silent... the pall of
          Glass' attack still hanging over them.
                         
          Bridger rises... walks to the Grizzly... crouches down over
          it, grabbing the animal's enormous paw. It dwarfs his own
          hand, as he examines the claws. Bridger pulls out his
          knife... stretches the claw out to its full length, and CUTS
          IT OFF AT ITS BASE.
                         
           FITZGERALD (O.S.)
           What makes you think you earned a
           claw?
                         
          Bridger turns with a start... sees Fitzgerald standing over
          him, meat in his hand... his lips shiny with the grease.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You didn't take that grizz down.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           It ain't for me.
                         
          Bridger stands... walks over to the sleeping Glass. Pig's
          already crouched beside him. Bridger lifts Glass' small
          leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle... drops
          the claw inside... throws a look back to Fitzgerald.
                         
          Pig holds his palm out just above Glass' mouth.
                         
                          PIG
           I can feel some air outta his
           mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his
           throat proper, huh?
           (off Bridger's silence)
           Whatta you figure his odds are,
           Jim?
                         
          Bridger stares down at what's left of Glass.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Long.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
                         
          The sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across
          the treetops.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - MORNING
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS...
           23.
                         
          ...unconscious but alive... his raspy breaths are weak and
          staggered. The SHADOWS OF MEN hover over him...
                         
          ...because Henry and the others surround Glass, staring down
          at him.
                         
                          MURPHY
           What that bear did to him... I
           didn't expect he'd last this long.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I seen a fella go a week once after
           a lion jumped him. Fever finally
           finished him off.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Whatta we do, Cap?
                         
          A long beat, then...
                         
                          HENRY
           We give him his chance.
                         
          Henry turns and walks away.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          The fire has burned down to nothing. The men sleep scattered
          about. Murphy stands just outside of camp, rifle ready,
          keeping watch.
                         
          Glass lies there awake... eyes wide open... a living corpse.
          And his breathing is just as labored as before... raspy,
          blood-soaked strains.
                         
          Fitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass' gurgling.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You ain't doin' him or us no
           favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer
           that way.
                         
          Henry's awake, but doesn't answer. He's holding his pistol
          in his hand, as he stares at Glass... thinking the same thing
          Fitzgerald just said. But he doesn't move... not yet.
                         
          Fitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling
          the sound. Bridger sits beyond him... smiles at Fitzgerald's
          misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER
          STRAP... a necklace.
           24.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - MORNING
                         
          Bridger kneels over a SHIVERING GLASS, holding wet rags on
          his head. Pig and Henry stand over them, watching.
                         
          Fitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled
          across camp.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Fever's hit. Won't be long now.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I seen a bad one drag on days.
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS...
                         
          ...eyes open... he can hear every word.
                         
           FITZGERALD (O.S.) (cont'd)
           Insides shut down... flesh starts
           to spoil and turn. Ain't no way
           for...
                         
           HENRY (O.S.)
           Quiet, Fitzgerald.
                         
          FITZGERALD...
                         
          ...points a stick at Glass.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (TO HENRY)
           We keep sittin' here watchin' him
           die, only gives the `Ree more
           chance to find us.
                         
          Henry doesn't answer... just keeps staring down at Glass.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           He's burnin', Cap. Water turns to
           boil as soon as it touches him.
                         
          Henry considers this, then...
                         
                          HENRY
           Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead.
           Grand should be just west of here.
           Find us the best route.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make
           sense for the rest of us, Captain.
           25.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (TO PIG)
           Get movin'.
                         
          Pig nods... grabs his gear. He and Anderson take off out of
          camp. Henry turns... walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby
          Bill.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           You two can start digging a grave.
                         
          Fitzgerald tosses the stick away.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Least it's a step in the right
           direction.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - LATER
                         
          Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep
          in Glass' grave. Stubby Bill stands over him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Any coyote digs that deep deserves
           the meal.
                         
          He takes Stubby Bill's hand... pulls himself out.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Glass won't know the difference no
           ways.
                         
          Pig and Anderson walk back into camp.
                         
                          PIG
           Found it, Cap. Right where Glass
           had us headed.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           No more than a mile or so out.
                         
          Henry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass.
                         
                          HENRY
           We could build a litter. Haul him
           with us.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           It's rocky and steep goin'.
                         
          Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer.
           26.
                         
                          PIG
           Marshy and thick on the other side.
           We could try it, but...
                         
          Pig shakes his head.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I signed on as a trapper, not a
           goddamn mule.
                         
                          BRIDGER
                          (TO HENRY)
           Shape he's in... I don't see no way
           he'd make bein' drug.
                         
          Henry nods, his mind racing for a solution. And before long,
          his hand is back on that pistol. He pulls it from his belt.
                         
          The other men all drop their heads... except for
          Fitzgerald... he's ready to see this end.
                         
          Henry stares down at Glass.
                         
                          HENRY
           Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr.
           Bridger.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           But, Captain.
                         
                          HENRY
           Do it.
                         
          Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over
          Glass' wide open eyes. And Glass must know what's happening,
          because his eyes roll up to Bridger's... his lips try to form
          a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - ON BRIDGER...
                         
          ...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes...
          everything goes black.
                         
           HENRY (O.S.)
           Step clear, Mr. Bridger.
                         
          A LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then...
                         
          BACK TO SCENE
           27.
                         
          Henry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down. His hand
          trembles slightly.
                         
          Pig turns away... presses his hands over his ears.
                         
          Bridger takes a few steps back... stares at Henry.
                         
          Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms...
          because he's thought of something else.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           There's a seventy dollar bonus from
           the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to
           the two men that stay with Glass...
           see this through. Then give him a
           proper burial.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I'll stay with him... money or not.
                         
                          PIG
           Same here.
                         
                          HENRY
           I can't let you stay back, Pig.
           Without Glass, I'll need you to
           scout.
                         
          Henry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not
          interested.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Just need one more.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Two won't stand much chance against
           a party of `Ree, Captain, and
           seventy dollars won't buy me a new
           setta ears.
                         
                          HENRY
           A hundred then.
                         
          Still nothing from the others.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           They can have my share too. I owe
           Glass that at least.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           That case I'll hang back with the
           kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or
           so behind for two hundred.
           28.
                         
                          HENRY
           But Glass is to be cared for until.
           Understood?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (motions to Bridger)
           I'll let the young doctor do his
           job.
                         
          Henry hesitates... doesn't like this, but knows it's the best
          option left.
                         
                          HENRY
           The rest gather your gear.
                         
          Bridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass' face.
          Their eyes meet... Bridger gives Glass a nod.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - LATER
                         
          Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. Pig
          bends down over Glass.
                         
                          PIG
           I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh.
                         
          Glass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. He moves the only thing he
          can... BLINKS a "yes" back at him.
                         
                          HENRY
           (to Fitzgerald and
                          BRIDGER)
           As long as necessary.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I'll look after him.
                         
          Henry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the
          Grand... toward Fort Union.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          What's left of a small fire is nothing but smoldering ash.
          Bridger crouches beside Glass, pouring a thin stream of broth
          between his lips. Fitzgerald reaches in... grabs Glass'
          Anstadt leaning against the tree.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I'll take first watch.
           29.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Not with his rifle.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be
           needin' it tonight.
                         
          Fitzgerald disappears into the trees.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Pig stands on a ridge, scouting a course. He waves back to
          Henry and the others. They start toward him.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - EVENING
                         
          Glass conscious on the ground... that same labored breathing.

          ...smiling down at Glass as he grabs the Anstadt, holds it...
          runs his hand down the barrel, as comfortable as if it were
          his own.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You were right to protect this.
                         
          Then he disappears... and we're left alone, staring up at the
          branches above us... the evening sky... accompanied by Glass'
          deathly breaths.

          Bridger kneels beside the stream, filling canteens.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - DAY
                         
          Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree, twisting a knife in his
          hands... flipping it point first into the dirt... grabbing...
          repeating... twist... flip... thwack. And as he does, his
          eyes are locked on Glass.
           30.
                         
          Finally, Fitzgerald snaps the knife from the dirt, stands,
          and walks over to Glass. Glass is asleep. Fitzgerald
          crouches down over him... eyes his red, infected wounds.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (WHISPERS)
           When are you gonna die, boy?
                         
          Fitzgerald reaches out with the blade... gently touches one
          of the threads holding Glass' throat together. And when he
          does, GLASS' EYES FLY OPEN... focus on Fitzgerald.
                         
          Fitzgerald doesn't even flinch... just holds that knife tip
          there against Glass' throat.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I'm nearly a week behind Henry's
           bunch on accounta havin' to tend to
           you. Be easier on us all if you'd
           take that last breath.
                         
          The two men hold a stare... until Fitzgerald pulls back the
          knife... grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them... balls
          it up in his fist.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I could help ya with that if you'd
           like. Muzzle ya right now... end
           all this sufferin' quick and easy.
           Nobody'd ever know you give up.
                         
          Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass' nose and mouth... holds
          it there, just inches above.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You just gimme a blink if you want
           me to do it.
                         
          Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald's... both men unblinking.
                         
          A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag... finally falls... lands
          on Glass' lips.
                         
          Fitzgerald almost smiles, waiting for the inevitable... as
          Glass stares back, fighting the urge to blink.
                         
          Suddenly Bridger's hand clamps down on Fitzgerald's shoulder.
          Fitzgerald spins... startled.
                         
           BRIDGER (O.S.)
           What's goin' on?
           31.
                         
          Fitzgerald jumps with a start, sees it's Bridger, and is
          pissed that Bridger scared him... and interrupted his
          business. He rises quickly, planting his meaty hand in
          Bridger's chest, and SLAMMING HIM BACK AGAINST A TREE.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Don't you ever question me, you
           little piss-ant.
                         
          Bridger tries to fight back, but Fitzgerald's too strong...
          holds him pressed against the tree... slams a heavy elbow
          into Bridger's mouth, splitting his lip.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I'd just as soon leave both you and
           your nigger here to rot. `Cept
           killin' you ain't worth givin' up
           your share.
                          (LEANS CLOSER)
           But that don't mean I can't be
           coaxed into changin' my mind.
                         
          Fitzgerald shoves him away... Bridger stumbles and falls.
          Fitzgerald tosses the bloody rag at him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And I was just doin' your job...
           cleanin' him up.
                         
          Fitzgerald grabs Glass' Anstadt, almost daring Bridger to say
          something. Of course Bridger doesn't. Fitzgerald walks
          toward the trees.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Why don't ya pour some more broth
           down his throat... keep him alive
           another week so we can fall farther
           back. End up walkin' all the way
           to Fort Union on our own. `Ree
           would love to poach on just two.
           (turns to Bridger)
           I promise ya, you'll look a helluva
           lot worse than Glass when they're
           done with you.
                         
          Bridger watches him disappear into the trees... wipes the
          blood from his lip with a trembling hand.

          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          From high above the trees. The world is silent... peaceful...
          until SEVERAL STARTLED CROWS shoot up from the treetops.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          BLACK...
                         
          ...the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING.
                         
           FITZGERALD (V.O.)
                          (PANICKED WHISPER)
           Bridger! Get your ass up!
                         
          Dim light fills the frame... then FITZGERALD'S FACE right in
          front of us.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           `Ree.
                         
                         
          BRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM UNDER HIS BLANKET, WIPING THE
          SLEEP FROM HIS FRIGHTENED EYES.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Keep quiet. I was down at the
           creek... there's twenty of `em at
           least, comin' this way.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Oh, shit. Whatta we do?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           We run. Now.
                         
          And Fitzgerald's just whispering, but it's with such power
          that Bridger has no response... watches as Fitzgerald gathers
          his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. Bridger is
          scared out of his mind... does the same... grabs for his
          rifle, resting near Glass.
                         
          Bridger freezes... in his panic, he'd forgotten all about
          Glass. And now the wounded man's eyes stare up at him...
          understanding perfectly what's happening around him.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What about Glass?
           33.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           He's on his own, same as us.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I can't leave him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Then I'm talkin' to a dead man.
                         
          Glass gives Bridger the slightest of nods... go. But
          Bridger's frozen... doesn't know what to do... until
          Fitzgerald shoves him back to life.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Move.
                         
          Glass reaches out a weak hand out for his Anstadt... clawing
          for his weapon. Bridger starts to hand it to Glass, but
          Fitzgerald grabs it first.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What're you doin'? He needs that.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           He couldn't hold it if you tarred
           it to his hands.
                         
          Glass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           It's his goddamn rifle! That's all
           he's got!
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           And more than he'll need.
                         
          Fitzgerald scoops up Glass' knife as well.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           We can't leave him with nothin'.
                         
          But Fitzgerald is already sprinting away... disappearing into
          the trees. Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes
          suddenly filled with a rage. And Bridger's frozen again,
          lost between duty and fear... until finally, he just shakes
          his head and takes off into the trees.
                         
          Glass's empty hand falls back to the ground... he tries to
          yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN. His hand
          digs into the dirt... pulls him over onto his side. He flops
          over to his stomach... GASPS IN PAIN...
           34.
          then using his one good arm, drags himself over the dirt, his
          healthy leg pushing weakly at the ground, trying to propel
          him forward... a futile chase after Fitzgerald and Bridger...
                         
          ...inch by inch... farther than he's been in days. But it's
          still only a few yards, and now he lies in the open... a
          clear target for the Arikara.
                         
          Then he spots that hole... the grave Fitzgerald dug for him.
          He grunts into action... grabs SEVERAL, THIN BROKEN BRANCHES
          from the ground, then claws forward, each movement
          excruciating... until finally, he reaches the hole, and ROLLS
          INTO IT... lands with a PAINFUL CRUNCH.
                         
          He rests there a moment, trying to regain any ounce of
          strength. Finally he fights through the pain... shoves the
          branches back up... spreading them across the hole as
          camouflage... a thin veil, but all that Glass has.
                         
          He lies there defenseless... INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE. Hiding...
          listening for the Arikara's arrival... waiting to die.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE... TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC...
          JUST THE NIGHT SKY THROUGH THOSE BRANCHES... AND THE SOUND OF
          HIS PAINFUL BREATHS.

          EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
                         
          Cold and grey. Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire,
          warming his hands. WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           We ran the better part of six
           hours. Had to gain some ground on
           Henry and them others.
                         
          Bridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening...
          staring... his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and
          over. He notices the smoke.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Best douse that smoke before them
           `Ree spot it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           We put enough distance between us
           and them. And it's too damn cold
           to go without one.
           35.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           All we know, they hoofed it through
           the night same as us.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (shakes his head)
           A dozen `Ree can't make the time us
           two did.
                         
          Bridger looks back to the trees... then considers something,
          stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before...
                         
                          BRIDGER
           It was twenty earlier.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           What?
                         
                          BRIDGER
           When you woke me... you said you'd
           spotted twenty `Ree.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           A dozen... twenty. I wasn't in a
           mood to count feathers. Hell, one
           `Ree woulda been too many.
                         
          Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the
          flames. Bridger stares at the water pouring out.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What was you even doin' down at the
           creak in the middle of the night?
                          (BEAT)
           I'd already brought plenty a water.
                         
          Fitzgerald doesn't answer. Bridger tightens his grip on his
          rifle... slowly rises.
                         
                          BRIDGER (CONT'D)
           Answer me.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Don't start questionin' me on
           accounta you feelin' guilty `bout
           leavin' your nigger buddy behind.
                         
          Bridger musters up all the courage he can... aims his rifle
          at Fitzgerald.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD
           OFF!
           36.
                         
          Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle... eyes
          taking in everything... a snake sizing up its prey. Then
          Fitzgerald stands... takes a step toward the boy.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           What're you askin'? Why it was you
           turned your back on Glass? Why you
           let him die to save your own sorry
           skin?
                          (BEAT)
           `Cause you was scared shitless,
           that's why.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           The `Ree... did you see `em?
           (off Fitzgerald's silence)
           DID YOU SEE `EM?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (MOVING CLOSER)
           Not a one.
                         
          Bridger CRIES OUT... starts to pull the trigger, when
          Fitzgerald's hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and
          shoving the butt back into Bridger's face... THWACK.
                         
          The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but
          Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it
          around to aim it at the boy. Blood drips down Bridger's head
          as he stares up at his rifle pointed down.
                         
          Fitzgerald's finger tightens on the trigger.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           So that there is the answer to your
           question.
                         
          And Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER... AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS
          EYES SHUT IN FEAR... THEN CLICK. Bridger opens his eyes...
          sees Fitzgerald sneering down at him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And the next time you aim to kill
           somebody, kid, best remember your
           gun won't fire without a flint.
                         
          Fitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away.
          Bridger's face flushes with rage and humiliation... he
          charges Fitzgerald from behind... tackles him to the
          ground... starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches.
                         
          A few of them land, but it's only a moment before Fitzgerald
          is back in control... HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him...
           37.
          tossing him away, then KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH...
          AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger
          off...
                         
          ...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two
          are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. He starts
          walking away.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I'm goin' back for him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Far as we ran all night, you
           couldn't find Glass with dogs and a
           map. And I don't believe you
           really want to. `Cause after
           leavin' him to die the first time,
           I doubt he'd be too happy to see
           you now.
                         
          Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife... covers the
          fire's remains.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And just so we're clear. If you
           try to backtrack without me
           knowin', or ever get so guilty you
           feel the need to tell somebody.
                         
          Fitzgerald looks at Bridger... hard... evil.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I'll have no choice but to gut you
           from nuts to nose.
                         
          Fitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into
          his belt, and stands.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Now let's go.
                         
          Bridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last
          glance behind him before following Fitzgerald.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - MORNING
                         
          Empty and quiet... no sign of life... until GLASS' HAND RISES
          BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. His fingers dig into the earth,
          pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out
          of his own grave.
                         
          He rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back
          hits the cold, hard surface.
           38.
          Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he
          has, then rolls over... starts dragging himself again with
          that one good arm. He makes it to the blanket... wraps it
          around him.
                         
          Glass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move...
          his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water...
          and he's wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any
          predator. So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN,
          and drags himself toward the cover of brush.
                         
          And every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push
          with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm...
          inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face
          as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues
          on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a
          desperate, hopeless crawl for survival.
                         
          But finally it's too much for Glass... the fever and pain
          overwhelm him. He collapses... falls unconscious.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Glass lies in the dirt, weak... dehydrated... starving. He
          looks at his hands... scratched and bloody from clawing his
          weight.
                         
          He unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag... dumps it to
          the ground, revealing it contents... flints, a straight
          razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR
          CLAW attached. Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN
          STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands.
                         
          He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing
          he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy
          leg... pull with his good arm.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER
                         
          Glass dragging himself up a steep slope... over rocks... the
          jagged edges catching the wounds... tearing the primitive
          stitching. The gashes rip wider... blood oozes down, leaving
          a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          The wind is howling through the trees. Glass lies beneath a
          cluster of brush... shivering... bleeding. Every aching
          breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air.
           39.
                         
                         
          EXT. MARSH - DAY
                         
          Thick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature
          cornstalks. Looking down from above the marsh we see a two-
          foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of
          the marsh, and stops.
                         
          We tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying
          among the Cattails. He's sawing off one of the stalks with
          the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the
          tender flesh beneath.
                         
          Mosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face...
          arms. But Glass' injured body only allows him one action at
          a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws
          on the Cattail.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Glass pulling himself along the ground... stopping to tear a
          FEW BERRIES from a plant, and shove them in his mouth. He
          flinches as he swallows. He starts to move again, but
          freezes... listens... RUSHING WATER.
                         
          Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy...
          pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and
          there it is at the bottom of the ridge...
                         
          ...THE GRAND RIVER... WATER. Glass crawls down toward it.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          Glass drags himself to the river's edge, cupping handfuls of
          water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding
          the pain to gulp it down.
                         
          As he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows
          beside him. He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it
          darts easily away.
                         
          Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he
          feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down
          his neck. He leans out over the surface to check his
          reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched-
          together, disfigured face staring back at him. He fights off
          the urge to vomit... pulls the razor from the leather bag,
          and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river,
          then cleaning his wounds.
           40.
                         
          He runs a finger up to his shredded throat... around the
          open, wet hole. He cups another handful of water to his
          mouth... strains to swallow, then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT
          OF THE HOLE.
                         
          Glass shoves the cloth against the wound... tries to press
          the flesh together... no good. He dumps out his Possibles
          bag... stares at the meager contents. He picks up one of the
          flints... looks to the powderhorn.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER
                         
          ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS...
                         
          ...as Glass SPARKS one of the flints... ignites the grass.
          As the fire grows, Glass pours a handful of GUNPOWDER from
          the horn, and RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT.
                         
          He lifts several small blades of burning grass... a miniature
          torch. And only then do we realize what he's about to do...
          because he stares at the flame a beat, then raises it toward
          his gunpowder-covered throat.
                         
          The flame nears the black powder, and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS,
          igniting the powder, and SETTING GLASS'S NECK ON FIRE.
                         
          Glass falls back to the ground in agony... TRIES TO SCREAM,
          but his burning, shredded vocal chords won't allow him.
                         
          The gunpowder sizzles and burns... the flame spreads...
          Glass' flesh sears... melts. And the pain is too much for
          Glass... he passes out.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS... looking dead beside the river, but we know
          he's alive because we can hear those same painful, raspy
          breaths.
                         
          And then we hear something else... an O.S. RATTLING, growing
          LOUDER... FASTER... BUZZING... until Glass' eyes flash open.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - ON A RATTLESNAKE COILED INCHES FROM HIS FACE.
                         
          Glass stares back in horror... has time to throw up his arm
          in protection as the snake STRIKES... SINKS ITS FANGS INTO
          HIS FOREARM.
           41.
          He shakes it free, but can't escape the snake's next
          strike... locking its jaws onto Glass' burned throat. Glass
          opens his mouth to scream.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          And Glass' eyes flying open in the glaring sun, as he awakens
          from his nightmare... looks to his arm... no snake. His hand
          instinctively jumps to his melted throat. No bites.
                         
          But that's when he hears it... we all do... that same
          RATTLING FROM HIS DREAM. Glass slowly turns his head toward
          the sound...
                         
          ...and there's a RATTLESNAKE COILED just a few feet away.
          Only it isn't poised to attack Glass. It's facing the other
          way, its target a FIELD MOUSE, trapped against a rock.
                         
          The snake attacks, sinking its fangs into the mouse. The
          field mouse tumbles over... quivers as the poison runs
          through its body, then dies.
                         
          As Glass watches the snake begin to make a meal of the mouse,
          his hand grips a rock. He drags himself toward the occupied
          snake... raises the rock high, then SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE
          SNAKE'S HEAD.
                         
          Glass immediately pulls the razor from his bag, and slices
          off the rattlesnake's head, the field mouse still lodged
          halfway inside. Glass then drags the razor down the length
          of the snake... digs his fingers under the fresh seam, then
          peels the outer layer down off the rattler.
                         
          With the skin still hanging off the round tube of flesh,
          Glass BITES INTO THE SNAKE, tearing off a chunk of meat. He
          gobbles it down, slowing only to painfully swallow the food
          past his injured throat.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER
                         
          ANGLE ON THE REMAINS OF THE SNAKE...
                         
          ...the head, skin, and not much else.
                         
          GLASS - at the water's edge, drinking... touching his
          charred, melted throat... no leaks. He opens his Possibles
          bag... pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE... stares at it a
          beat, then slips it over his head.
           42.
                         
          He drags out the map... spreads it on the ground, then throws
          a glance around him... fingers the point on the blue line...
          a rough guess of his location.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE MAP...
                         
          ...Fort Union at the top... hundreds of miles north. Fort
          Brazeau south... but not nearly as far away.
                         
          Glass gazes north up the Grand, as if he can see Fitzgerald
          and Bridger just ahead of him. Then he looks back down to
          his reflection in the water... battered and scarred. He
          looks to his leg... all but worthless for now... his one good
          arm. It's clear he's not ready to take revenge on anyone.
                         
          So Glass shoves the map back into the bag... ties it around
          his arm with the powderhorn and blanket, then grabs a THICK,
          FALLEN LOG, and rolls it into the river. Glass crawls in
          behind it... deeper, until the current grows strong enough to
          carry the weight of his mangled body downstream.
                         
          Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log, and starts
          floating... letting the river do the work. He watches the
          land move past him faster than it has in days... and without
          all the agony of every move.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          Winding through the open prairie. Glass hangs onto the
          log... floats with the gentle current.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - EVENING
                         
          The sinking sun casts an orange glow over the water. Glass
          floats downstream... past a HERD OF ELK grazing along the
          riverbank. The animals don't even notice him.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Dark... the moon hidden behind clouds. A heavy mist hangs
          over the river. Glass is draped across the log, eyes
          closed... letting the slow current carry him south. But then
          his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE.
                         
          Glass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything
          clearly. The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead... too
          dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in
          front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air.
           43.
                         
          But then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog,
          scanning the surface. But it's gone... the water's empty...
          that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER.
                         
          Glass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST
          AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what's coming, but
          it's too late... because the world suddenly turns upside
          down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT
          WATERFALL.
                         
          He spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current.
          He's washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. They
          pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out.
                         
          The river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing...
          turning... SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... CRACK... he
          spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking
          him down the rocky gauntlet.
                         
          He tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps
          loose... Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped
          down another set of falls.
                         
          The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river.
                         
          Glass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the
          rapids calm... spit Glass to the gentle shallows. His body
          drifts face-down toward shore.
                         
          And just when we're sure Glass has to finally be dead, his
          arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the
          muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river.
                         
          Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded
          in that mist.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS' FACE... the right still
          pressed into the muddy bank. The sun beats down... then
          SHADOWS APPEAR... BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing
          over Glass.
                         
          And then a VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME...
                         
          ...latches its beak onto Glass' cheek... tugs at it...
          stretches it. Glass' eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see
          THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking and clawing
          at his battered wounds.
           44.
                         
          Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away.
          He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from
          his throat.
                         
          The vultures dance away from his flailing... aren't willing
          to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks
          on his flesh.
                         
          Glass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them
          back. The vultures give up the battle... fly away.
                         
          Glass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the
          sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM...
          waiting for him to die.
                         
          Glass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood. He
          glances around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away.
                         
          At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free,
          creating a partial cave. Glass starts crawling toward it.
          And if it's possible, he looks even closer to death now than
          when he started this journey.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          No more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from
          predators. Glass drags himself as far back in the recess as
          he can... collapses against the rock wall.
                         
                         
          INT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile...
          begins sparking rocks together to build a fire.
                         
                         
          INT. CAVE - LATER
                         
          The fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of
          cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny
          hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK... a
          man-made needle and thread.
                         
          Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest...
          piercing his skin with the rock... wincing with pain as he
          tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin... pierces
          the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly
          together... before repeating the excruciating process all
          over again... pierce... pull... pierce... tighten.
           45.

          The moon's glow reflects off the water.
                         
                         
          INT. CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS' HAND...
                         
          ...holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO
          THE CAVE'S ROCK WALL.
                         
          WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND... still listening to the
          SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt... reach
          the fire... its flame warm and strong. We TIGHTEN ON THE
          FIRE, until WE'RE INSIDE IT... and then WE PULL BACK...
                         
          ...and we see the fire has long died away... just black ash.
          The O.S. SCRATCHING has silenced. We glide back across the
          cave floor... to Glass unconscious on the ground. And above
          him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching...
                         
          "Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald and Bridger. If find
          eether kill for Hugh Glass"
                         
          We hold on those words a beat, then...
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          DROPS OF RAIN dot the surface. THUNDER RUMBLES... the rain
          grows heavier.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          Rain pouring... gullies of water run down the ridge, spewing
          over the mouth of the cave. But inside, Glass doesn't
          stir... lying there just as we last saw him.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          Rain coming down in buckets. The river's raging.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          Clouds drift across the moon... the storm has ended.
           46.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          Sunny and clear. A rabbit hops along... stops for a moment
          outside the cave. Beyond it, Glass is still sprawled on the
          cave floor... he must be dead. The rabbit continues on past.
                         
                         
          INT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          TIGHT ON GLASS' FACE... as his eyes flutter open. He stares
          straight ahead, unmoving.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          Glass crawls out of the crevice... shields his eyes from the
          sun, as he takes in the scene.
                         
          The river has sunk back to normal, leaving the banks battered
          and muddy. The water is thick and brown with all the flooded
          earth it pulled up.
                         
          Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees, then
          higher... onto his healthy leg. He braces himself against a
          tree. He's still crooked and hunched over, but for the first
          time since the Grizzly attack, he looks more like a man than
          an animal. He bends down... picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          Glass limps along the bank... beside the brown water stirred
          up from the flood. He moves along the washed-out area,
          searching for food... grabs some plants... tears them from
          the ground to chew on the roots.
                         
          He continues on... spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in
          the flood, frozen on its back. Glass kneels down to pick up
          the turtle... sniffs it. As he does, he spots something
          across the river... a DEER, staring back at him.
                         
          Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE... takes careful aim
          at the deer... pulls the trigger. If only he had his Anstadt.
                         
          But then the deer's head snaps... to something beyond Glass.
          Glass follows the animal's eyes... turns to the ridge... and
          the FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS' CAVE.
                         
          Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the
          flood. He looks back across the river... THE DEER IS LONG
          GONE.
           47.
                         
          Glass inches his head up over the tree... to the warriors now
          crouched outside the cave... studying the tracks.
                         
          Glass' eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river... HIS
          FOOTPRINTS CLEAR... an obvious trail leading right to him.
          He throws a glance around... nowhere to run even if he could.
          So he starts backing into the river on his stomach... feet-
          first... dragging a small branch over the tracks around him,
          wiping them away as he moves. And his eyes are locked on the
          Arikara... watching to see if they spot him.
                         
          But they haven't yet, and Glass keeps sliding backward...
          five feet off shore... only three feet deep in the murky
          water and sludge. But if he goes any further, the current
          will catch him... pull him into the next set of violent
          rapids... and make him a clear target.
                         
          The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave.
                         
          Glass sinks neck-deep into the water... the Arikara keep
          coming... near the river. So Glass drops beneath the surface.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         UNDERWATER -
                         
          And Glass' eyes spread wide... searching the muddy water. He
          grabs a LARGE ROCK... rolls onto his back, and places the
          rock on his stomach, its weight holding him firmly to the
          river bottom.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS... following Glass' tracks to
          the edge of the river... looking out over the brown river.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
                         UNDERWATER -
                         
          Glass pressing his head back against the bottom... staring up
          through the cloudy water... to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY
          A FEW FEET AWAY.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass...
          looking back to the tracks... scanning the water. But the
          surface is empty, and the river's too thick with mud to see
          anything below.
           48.
                         
          But they keep looking... and we're waiting for Glass to
          explode from the river, gasping for air. But he doesn't...
          and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until
          finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path.
                         
          Behind them, Glass' face inches to the surface... pulls in
          some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees.
                         
          Then Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into
          the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and
          boulders... pulling himself to the other side.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Glass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy
          water of the Grand.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER
                         
          Glass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD
          MOUSE. The rodent escapes into a hole. Glass claws at the
          ground after it. He's starving to death.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          The rain beating down through the trees. Glass huddles in a
          cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the
          cold. He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin
          boot standing in the rain. He pulls it in... slurps back the
          rainfall that it's caught.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING
                         
          Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. He's weak...
          starving... isn't going to make it much further. He drops to
          his hands and knees.
                         
          And then he feels something... the ground almost trembling
          under his hands. He watches his hands quiver with vibration.
          A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest
          of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING
                         
          Glass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a
          HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE.
           49.
                         
          An incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their
          hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind
          them.
                         
          Behind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN
          BUFFALO.
                         
          Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND
          SNAP over the remains. And he eyes that buffalo... the
          closest he's been to food in days.
                         
                         
          EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT
                         
          The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts
          bloody from the meal. Suddenly, one of the wolves' heads
          snaps up... bares its teeth... SNARLS.
                         
          And then we see what the wolf is growling at... Glass...
          limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a
          BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS
          clawing in the night.
                         
          The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what's approaching.
          They growl at Glass. But Glass keeps coming... doing his
          best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves. He
          swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the
          air.
                         
          The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. But
          Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames...
          driving each wolf back.
                         
          Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its
          ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away...
          SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure
          what its up against.
                         
          Glass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS'
          ARM. Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across
          the wolf's head.
                         
          The wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns
          back... makes another charge at Glass. But Glass is ready...
          throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it
          with the other. The animal's fur begins to burn.
                         
          The frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground,
          then spins to join the rest of its pack. They run a safe
          distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass.
           50.
                         
          Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground,
          igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming
          wall between him and the wolves.
                         
          He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds
          the fallen buffalo.
                         
          The wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the
          flames.
                         
          As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants...
          attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of
          flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a
          starving animal that's finally found food.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT
                         
          From high above the prairie... Glass and the buffalo at the
          center of that glowing ring of fire.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY
                         
          The wind's gusting... bending the high golden grass over on
          its side. Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up
          to shield his face from the cold winds. He spots something
          in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE.
          Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          The charred, skeletal remains of a tribe's village... just
          black posts where tee-pees once stood... a half-burned log
          lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky.
                         
          Glass limps through the graveyard of structures... all signs
          of life in this village long gone. He searches a basket...
          pulls out a BLANKET... wraps it around his shoulders.
                         
                         
          INT. LODGE - DAY
                         
          Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge... black and
          empty. He slides down to the floor... unwraps strips of
          roasted buffalo from what's left of his blanket. He starts to
          take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE
          BACK ROOM. The O.S. SHUFFLING OF FEET.
                         
          Glass freezes... he isn't alone. He rises... grabs a
          splintered post like a spear... eases toward the doorway...
          raises the post to swing...
           51.
                         
          ...and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room. The
          dog takes off around a crumbled wall. Glass follows it.
                         
                         
          INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Glass limps across the room... turns the corner of the
          crumbled wall... and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an
          ANCIENT ARIKARA SQUAW, huddled in the corner, her bony arms
          outstretched in front of her in weak defense. And her eyes
          are SOLID WHITE... the old woman is blind. She CRIES OUT A
          CHANT over and over... her death chant, as she waits for this
          stranger to kill her.
                         
          Glass stands frozen... confused. He tries to speak, but his
          throat still won't let him. He crouches down in front of the
          old woman... reaches for her hand, but she flails him away.
          He grabs her again... gently... just holds it until she
          calms... studying the woman... her hollow face all skin and
          bones... she's obviously dying.
                         
          He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket... pushes
          it into the squaw's hand. She immediately jerks it to her
          mouth... and that's when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH...
          she can't eat.
                         
          Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream. The dog
          scurries out behind him... follows Glass to the water.
                         
                         
          INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - DAY
                         
          The pot boils over burning logs. Glass dips a cup in,
          pulling out a warm broth. He carries it to the squaw, still
          sitting in the corner... takes her hand, placing the cup in
          it for her. She gulps the liquid back.
                         
          Glass goes back to refill the cup. The old woman MUMBLES
          SOMETHING we can't understand... over and over, as Glass
          brings the cup back to her. He tries to ease it into her
          hand, but the woman pushes it away... slides her hand up
          Glass' arm to his face... patting it... MUMBLING THOSE SAME
          WORDS... thanking Glass.
           52.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING
                         
          Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge. The puppy
          trails behind him, biting at one of the corners... hanging on
          as Glass pulls him across the dirt.
                         
                         
          INT. LODGE - EVENING
                         
          Glass enters the back room with the blankets... stops when he
          sees the old woman slumped over to the floor, her white eyes
          frozen open in a lifeless stare.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at
          the edge of the village. The squaw lies atop the pyre,
          covered in the blankets he gathered for her. Glass stands
          beside the pyre, a FLAMING TORCH in his hand. The puppy
          rests at his feet.
                         
                         
          EXT. DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          THREE INDIANS sit on horseback, watching Glass light the
          pyre... the flames rise into the night.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass crouches... pets the dog, as he watches the flames
          spread... engulf the woman.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE GLOWING EMBERS...
                         
          ...floating into the night. Beyond the sparks, we see
          something else... THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE
          VILLAGE... FAST.
                         
          And now Glass sees them too... knows it's too late to run, so
          he just stands there. But the dog's seen enough... darts
          away.
                         
          Glass watches the Indians ride into the village... their
          braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we've
          seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass
          knows it.
                         
          The Sioux surround Glass on horseback... stare down at Glass.
          The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE), (30's), poised and strong,
          points to the flaming pyre... says something to Glass.
           53.
                         
          Glass tries to answer... can't... touches his scarred throat.
          Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse. The other two
          warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same...
          close in on Glass.
                         
          Glass stands firm. Spotted Horse says something else to him.
          Again, Glass touches his throat... holds his jacket out from
          his sides... no weapons. Spotted Horse studies Glass hard...
          reaches out, wiping his finger down Glass' cheek, almost
          testing to see if the color comes off.
                         
          One of the other warriors pats Glass' hair... smiles... says
          something to the others. Spotted Horse and the other warrior
          join him, each touching Glass' hair.
                         
          Then Spotted Horse spots Glass' necklace... the grizzly claw
          hanging from it. He examines the enormous claw, then nods to
          Glass' stitching and scars.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Griz-lee.
                         
          Glass hears the familiar word... nods. Three Feathers pulls
          a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass' neck... holds it up to
          Spotted Horse.
                         
          Spotted Horse jerks out his knife. Glass is confused...
          holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. But Three
          Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass... secure him... pull his
          jacket down off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Spotted
          Horse walks around behind Glass... raises the knife... Glass
          GROWLS A PLEA... but Spotted Horse slices the knife down
          Glass' back... just cutting open his shirt... and revealing a
          MASS OF WHITE WORMS... MAGGOTS... COVERING THE DEEP GASHES ON
          GLASS' BACK.
                         
          The three warriors exchange glances... they've obviously
          never seen anything like this. Glass sees their reaction...
          throws a nervous glance... what?
                         
          Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass' back, dragging a
          HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see. As Glass' eyes widen in
          panic, Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against
          Glass' head.
                         
          Glass drops to his knees... makes a dazed grab for Spotted
          Horse... misses... and Spotted Horse HITS GLASS AGAIN. Glass
          tumbles unconscious to the dirt.
                         
          Spotted Horse says something to the others... they grab
          Glass' limp arms... drag him toward the horses.
           54.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea
          of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night
          sky. Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various
          tee-pees and lodges. SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the
          village... freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other
          riders splash across the stream.
                         
          The warriors ride into the village, Glass' body tossed over
          the back of Three Feather's horse. The children race to them.
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS... regaining consciousness... eyes blinking...
          trying to focus.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE...
                         
          ...to the children's eager faces swarming around him...
          studying this strange face.
                         
          Spotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children... they
          back away from Glass... fall into line behind the riders.
                         
          Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past... to
          a tee-pee set away from the rest... its hide walls decorated
          with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human
          figures circling the sun.
                         
          An OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied
          in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black
          stripes, steps out of the tee-pee. He eyes Glass, as Three
          Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside.
                         
          Suddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN'S V.O.
          CHANTING...
                         
          LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS' WRISTS AND ANKLES...
          stretched tight.
                         
          Glass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee,
          his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in
          the ground. The white worms cover his back.
           55.
                         
          The Medicine Man... CHANTING... waving burning sticks in the
          air.
                         
          A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT... the Medicine Man's twisted
          hand reaching a gourd container in... filling it with the
          steaming mixture.
                         
          The liquid POURING OVER GLASS' BACK.
                         
          GLASS' FACE... arched to the sky... twisted in horrible pain.
          He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY.
                         
          MORE IMAGES... even faster... the CHANTING more frantic...
                         
          A SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down.
                         
          HANDS wiping a GREEN SLUDGE over Glass' neck... chest.
                         
          The Medicine Man dancing... chanting... shaking sticks lined
          with RATTLESNAKE TAILS.
                         
          The moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the
          images of the buffalo and dancing shapes.
                         
          Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass' mouth.
                         
          The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE...
          lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass' throat.
                         
          GLASS' EYES... wide open... rolling up white into his head.
                         
          AND THE CHANTING STOPS... the world goes dark.
                         
                         
          EXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY
                         
          Cutting through the open prairie. Snow-covered peaks touch
          the sky in the distance.
                         
          Fitzgerald and Bridger trudge their way across the prairie,
          dressed in furs. They rise up a steep slope... reach the
          top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive
          thirty-foot tall wooden fence. Fort Union.
                         
          Bridger smiles... relieved.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           `Bout goddamn time.
                         
          They start down the slope. Fitzgerald grabs Bridger's arm...
          firmly.
           56.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And we're understood on
           everything... Glass' dyin' in his
           sleep... us buryin' him like was
           agreed.
                         
          Bridger doesn't respond. Fitzgerald doesn't like that.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You're as guilty as me in leavin'
           him. Don't you forget that. You
           got a future up here. No sense
           tossin' it away when he was as good
           as dead already. Shit, all we did
           was skip the funeral.
                         
          Bridger pulls his arm free... continues on.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I won't take to givin' up that two-
           hundred on accounta you gettin'
           weak-kneed.
                         
          Bridger keeps walking. Fitzgerald follows behind.
                         
                         
          INT. FORT UNION - DAY
                         
          Like a small town surrounded by a log wall. The main TRADING
          POST BUILDING is busy... TRAPPERS, SIOUX, all with things to
          trade. But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next
          door... crowded with customers downstairs, and just as busy
          in the whores' rooms upstairs.
                         
          A small village of tents rests off to the side of the
          buildings, holding the overflow of traffic.
                         
                         
          INT. SALOON - DAY
                         
          Fitzgerald and Bridger enter the crowded room... squeeze
          their way to the bar.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Twice the folks here than when we
           left.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           We should go see Captain Henry.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Far as we hiked... we got time for
           a drink on the company's tab.
           57.
                         
           PIG (O.S.)
           Jim!
                         
          They spin... see Pig, Murphy and Stubby Bill sitting at a
          table. Pig scrambles up... rushes to Bridger, locking him in
          a big bear hug.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           You made it! I was scared the `Ree
           mighta caught up to ya.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           If your fat ass could get through,
           we didn't have no worries.
                         
          Pig glares at Fitzgerald... watches him walk to the table,
          joining the others.
                         
                          PIG
           (off Fitzgerald, to
                          BRIDGER)
           Had to be a helluva long walk for
           you.
                         
          Bridger nods... Pig has no idea.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           Hugh?
                         
          Bridger hesitates a beat, then just shakes his head.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           Guess we all knowed how it would
           turn out. Did he suffer much more?
                         
          Another long beat, then...
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I hope not.
                         
          A PROSTITUTE walks down the stairs... stops on the landing,
          waiting for her next customer. Fitzgerald spots her...
          grins.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (TO BRIDGER)
           Maybe we best go see Henry, kid. I
           just got a itch to spend the first
           of my two-hundred.
                         
          The other men laugh. Not Bridger.
           58.
                         
                         
          INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Henry sits at his desk. Fitzgerald and Bridger stand across
          from him. The others... Pig, Anderson, Murphy, and Stubby
          Bill crowd the room behind them.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I won't pretend to been his friend,
           but I respect any man that fights
           the way he done.
                         
                          HENRY
           And the grave?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           We had those extra days so we went
           deeper... covered it in rocks. To
           keep the scavengers off him.
                         
                          HENRY
           Any sign of hostiles?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Not a one.
                         
          The words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger. He can't
          take the pain... opens his mouth to speak, but Fitzgerald
          beats him to it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Truth is, I was worried `bout `Ree,
           and ready to get movin', but
           Bridger here argued to stay and
           make a cross for the grave.
                         
          Bridger's head snaps to Fitzgerald... don't make this worse.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           So that's what we did.
                         
          Pig reaches up... gives Bridger a pat on the back. But to
          Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade.
                         
                          HENRY
           Glad to hear you pulled your
           weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you
           would.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           More than his share, Captain.
           59.
                         
          And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie. Bridger
          drops his eyes to his feet.
                         
                          HENRY
           Speaking of shares.
                         
          Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. Fitzgerald
          watches as Henry spins the dial... locks in the combination,
          then pulls the latch. The safe door swings open...
                         
          ...revealing STACKS OF CASH.
                         
          Fitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. Henry pulls out a
          handful... starts counting them out onto the desk.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Am I to assume the agreed
           arrangement didn't change?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Fortunate for me, it did not.
                         
                          HENRY
           Well thank you both for your
           courage and honor. You have done
           yourselves proud.
                         
          Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. Henry drops a couple
          bills in front of Bridger.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           You're owed something for what you
           did.
                         
          Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then snatches
          them... pushes his way out of the office before he might have
          to look someone in the eye.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           He's beat hisself up most of the
           trip... wishin' he'da done more.
                         
                          HENRY
           We all saw the shape Glass was in.
           There was no more to be done.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           That's what I been tellin' him.
           60.
                         
                         
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY
                         
          Empty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, squeezing
          those crumpled bills in his hand, crying.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          INT. TEE-PEE - DAY
                         
          Glass sleeps under a buffalo robe. His eyes flicker open.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS
          SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE.
                         
          GLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat. It looks much
          better than we last saw. And the stitches are gone from his
          face, now just long, pink scars. He stiffly raises himself
          up... remembers his back... struggles to reach behind him...
          scarred but clean... no maggots.
                         
          He looks beside him... sees BUCKSKIN PANTS AND SHIRT resting
          on the ground... waiting for him.
                         
                         
          EXT. TEE-PEE - DAY
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS... dressed... pushing his way out through the
          flap of the tee-pee... limping out into the midday sun, and
          shielding his eyes. He looks like a man that hasn't seen the
          light of day for weeks.
                         
          Glass adjusts to the brightness... stares in wonder at the
          scene.
                         
          And then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his
          reaction... the entire village is blanketed in snow. The
          Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs.
                         
          A WOMEN'S O.S. VOICE turns Glass...
                         
          ...to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him,
          bundled in fur. She says something else we can't
          understand... points to Glass' feet. Glass looks down... to
          his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW. He hadn't noticed.
                         
          And then Waki smiles... a sweet, pretty smile. She takes his
          hand... leads him back into the tee-pee.
           61.
                         
                         
          INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Glass and Waki enter. She pulls a pair of moccasins from a
          basket... hands them to Glass.
                         
          He slips them on, then presses his fingers against his
          throat... almost trying to hold it all inside to make it
          work, then...
                         
                          GLASS
           (scratching and rough)
           Thank you.
                         
          Waki doesn't understand... just raises a cup of liquid...
          says something, then touches his throat... motions for him to
          drink. Glass sips the drink... grimaces... shakes his head,
          trying to give the cup back, but Waki refuses... points at
          his throat, and motions for him to drink. Glass stares in
          the cup a beat, then gulps it back... shakes his head.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Bad medicine.
                         
          Waki smiles... hands him his BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass nods
          in thanks, then achingly lifts his arms up to slip it over
          his head.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           How long have I been here?
                         
          Waki just stares back... no idea what Glass said.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           You're Sioux. I only know a bit a
           Pawnee.
                         
          Glass stumbles through a sentence of Pawnee. Waki shakes her
          head... throws a jumble of Sioux back at him.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           The snow... my healin'.
           (points to himself)
           Me.
           (points to the ground)
           Here. How long?
                         
          Waki shakes her head again. Glass leads her outside.
           62.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Glass points to the sun overhead, then raises both hands,
          fingers outstretched.
                         
                          GLASS
           How many suns? Ten?
                         
          Waki studies Glass... the sun... begins to understand. She
          nods... SAYS A WORD... holds up all ten of her fingers.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Ten suns?
                         
          Then Waki closes her hands into fists... opens them again...
          closes them again... SAYS A DIFFERENT WORD.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Christ.
                         
          Glass glances around... for the first time, notices Sioux MEN
          and WOMEN staring at him. Children freeze in the middle of
          their play... all eyes locked on Glass. TWO SMALL BOYS, (NEW
          MOON and LITTLE ONE), repeat the same TWO WORDS to each
          other...
                         
                          BOYS
           Tatanka Wicasa.
                         
          ...over and over.
                         
          Glass stares back, unsure. Then...
                         
           SPOTTED HORSE (O.S.)
           Buff-A-lo Man.
                         
          Glass turns... sees Yellow Horse stepping out of a tee-pee.
                         
           Spotted Horse (cont'd)
           (very broken english)
           What they call you.
           (points to Glass' hair)
           Fur of Buff-A-lo.
                         
          Glass touches his hair... nods... smiles. The children smile
          and laugh now too... repeat the words LOUDER.
                         
                          GLASS
           You speak English.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Need words when trade with whites.
           63.
                         
                          GLASS
           Well I'm grateful for you bringing
           me here... havin' them care for me.
           (off Spotted Horse's nod)
           Now if you could point me which way
           it is you do your tradin'... with
           the whites.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
                          (POINTS)
           Whites. Bra-zo.
                         
                          GLASS
           Fort Brazeau? That's where I'm
           tryin' to get. Is it far from here?
                         
          Spotted Horse doesn't understand. Glass motions into the
          distance.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Far? Long way?
                         
          Spotted Horse points to a horse, then holds up three fingers.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Three days on horse?
                         
          Spotted Horse nods... looks Glass over, and shakes his head.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Not walk. Hides soon.
                         
          Glass doesn't understand... until Spotted Horse points to a
          ROW OF BUFFALO HIDES hanging from a line.
                         
           Spotted Horse (cont'd)
           We trade Bra-zo.
                         
          Glass stares at the tanning hides, then down at his leg.
          Finally, he nods. Spotted Horse starts walking... waves for
          Glass to follow.
                         
           Spotted Horse (cont'd)
           Come. Eat.
                         
          Glass follows after him. The children sneak in behind,
          giggling as they tail Glass across camp.
                         
          Glass glances back... New Moon and Little One duck behind a
          tee-pee... wait for him to continue before they scoot back
          out after him.
           64.
                         
                         
          INT. CHIEF'S LODGE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass, Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox and OTHER
          WARRIORS sit around a fire, eating with CHIEF RED HAWK, the
          Medicine Man, and several other TRIBAL ELDERS.
                         
                          GLASS
           The men stole my rifle.
                         
          The Sioux don't understand. Glass reaches over, taking
          Spotted Horse's plate.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           They took. They took...
                         
          Glass aims an imaginary rifle.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           ...my rifle. My gear.
                         
          Now Spotted Horse understands... translates for the others.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           They left me to die. So I mean to
           find `em both. Get my rifle back.
                         
          Spotted Horse translates again. Red Hawk nods, studying
          Glass.
                         
          Red Hawk SAYS SOMETHING to Glass... motions to the BEAR CLAW
          NECKLACE. Glass looks to Spotted Horse.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee.
                         
          Glass touches his chest. Red Hawk nods, impressed. Glass
          points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk's neck to a
          MISSING RIGHT EAR.
                         
                          GLASS
           Grizzly?
                         
          Red Hawk smiles... shakes his head.
                         
                          RED HAWK
           Arikara.
                         
          That word, Glass understands. Red Hawk rambles a long
          sentence in Sioux. The other members LAUGH.
           65.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           He say Arikara take right ear of
           Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not
           know what they take from you.
                         
          Glass smiles along with the others. They continue their meal.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Snow falls over Glass, as he stands outside the tee-pee,
          flexing his injured leg... putting more weight on it...
          testing its recovered strength.
                         
          Suddenly, a SPEAR PLANTS INTO THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS FEET.
          Glass turns, startled... sees Spotted Horse, Three Feathers,
          Running Fox, and several OTHER WARRIORS staring at him.
                         
          Glass' eyes jump from the spear to the warriors, unsure.
                         
          Spotted Horse strides to Glass... grabs the spear, then spins
          it sideways... stares at Glass, until a smile spreads across
          Spotted Horse's face... he holds the spear out to Glass.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux?
                         
          Glass relaxes... nods... takes the spear from Spotted Horse.
          Three Feathers hands a BUFFALO HIDE to Glass... motions for
          Glass to put it on.
                         
                          THREE FEATHERS
           Tatanka Wicasa.
                         
          Glass wraps the hide around him. The Warriors smile and nod.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          A world of silent white... like we're inside a giant snow-
          globe. The sky is emptying all the snow it has over us...
          pouring down... the only sound comes from the flakes hitting
          the already fallen snow. The pale trunks of Cottonwoods rise
          up from the white ground.
                         
          Then out of the white... a SHAPE APPEARS... a GIANT WOLF
          WALKING ON ITS HIND LEGS. But as the wolf comes closer, we
          see it's not a wolf at all... it's THREE FEATHERS, wearing
          his WOLF SKIN. He CRIES OUT... HOWLING WILDLY.
                         
          A few yards beside him, another WARRIOR is doing the same...
          CHANTING... beating his spear against the Cottonwoods as he
          walks.
           66.
                         
                         
          GLASS - WEARING THE BUFFALO HIDE...
                         
          ...walking slowly through the trees, carrying the spear.
          Yellow Bear is beside him... motions for Glass to spread out.
                         
                         
          FROM ABOVE THE TREES...
                         
          ...we see the fur-covered warriors are formed into a wide
          circle... and slowly converging... YELLING... pounding their
          spears... making as much noise as possible, as they tighten
          their ring.
                         
                         
          POV FROM THE BRUSH...
                         
          ...watching DISTANT CHANTING WARRIORS pushing through the
          trees. V.O. SNORTING... our POV darts sideways... charges
          through the brush... slides to a stop when we see Running Fox
          moving toward us... spins back another direction.
                         
                         
          GLASS - MOVING THROUGH THE FOREST...
                         
          ...the falling snow clinging to his face... covering the
          buffalo hide.
                         
          And then a MASSIVE SHAPE BLASTS through the trees ahead of
          him. Glass freezes, his grip tightening on the spear. He
          looks to Spotted Horse, who nods... YELLS OUT, beating his
          spear against the trees, and motioning for Glass to do the
          same.
                         
          Glass is apprehensive at first... just lightly tapping his
          spear. But as the other warriors' chants grow, Glass gets
          caught up in the hunt... begins beating the trees... YELLING
          as loud as his throat will allow.
                         
                         
          THE WARRIORS - EYES PIERCING THROUGH THE SNOW... CHANTING...
          BEATING THE BUSHES.
                         
                         
          OUR LOW POV AGAIN - RACING CHAOTICALLY THROUGH THE BRUSH...
                         
          ...to Spotted Horse waving his spear... back over the snow...
          to Three Feathers SCREAMING... we spin again... crash through
          bushes, then suddenly TUMBLE... DROP THROUGH THE SNOW.
           67.
                         
                         
          GLASS - HEARING THE ANIMAL'S WAIL...
                         
          ...seeing Spotted Horse pick up his pace... start trotting
          forward. Glass does the same... all the hunters converging
          around a LARGE BLACK HOLE IN THE SNOW...
                         
          ...and the ELK trapped at the bottom.
                         
          The warriors cry out victoriously... begin DRIVING THEIR
          SPEARS INTO THE TRAP, killing the animal.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - EVENING
                         
          The elk roasts over a fire at the center of the village.
          Glass sits alone outside the tee-pee, using the sharp tip of
          the spear to carve into a small chunk of wood.
                         
          As he carves, New Moon and Little One sneak around the tee-
          pee behind him... watch Glass work. Glass hears them
          GIGGLING... doesn't react... just keeps carving... tilts the
          long handle of the spear as he works, tapping the side of the
          tee-pee, and SHAKING LOOSE A CLUMP OF SNOW DOWN ONTO THE
          BOYS.
                         
          The shocked boys freeze in the cold... wipe the snow from
          their faces to see Glass grinning at them. The little boys
          charge Glass, leaping onto him... wrestling him to the
          ground, as they squeeze his hair.
                         
                          BOYS
           Tatanka Wicasa! Tatanka Wicasa!
                         
          Spotted Horse stands across the village, watching Glass and
          the boys play in the snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass stands at the edge of the village, carving at the wood
          with the spear tip, and watching the Sioux from a distance.
          Yellow Bear sees him... approaches, carrying his SON on his
          shoulders. The little boy gnaws on a strip of meat.
                         
          Spotted Horse holds out a bowl of food to Glass.
                         
                          GLASS
           Thank you.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Good hunt.
           68.
                         
                          GLASS
           Yes.
                         
          Glass smiles up at Spotted Horse's son.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           You. Fam-i-lee?
                         
                          GLASS
           (shakes his head)
           No.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           No wom-an?
           (pointing to son)
           Wakayaja?
                         
          A long beat, then...
                         
                          GLASS
           No. Not for a long time.
                         
          Glass continues eating... watches Spotted Horse bounce the
          giggling little boy on his shoulders.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Glass steps out of his tee-pee, whittling with the spear tip.
          He glances up... freezes because he sees several Sioux
          pulling the hides from the line... rolling them up to carry.
                         
           Spotted Horse (O.S.)
           Bra-zo.
                         
          Glass turns to Spotted Horse, pointing to the hides. Glass
          nods... looks back to the last of the hides being pulled
          down... doesn't seem as excited as he once might have been.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - LATER
                         
          Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit atop their horses.
          Three Feathers holds the reins to another horse packed with
          hides. An empty horse stands beside them... waiting for
          Glass.
                         
          Glass is leaning over to New Moon and Little One... handing
          them the CRUDE BUFFALO CARVING he made from the wood.
                         
                          GLASS
           (taps his chest)
           Tatanka Wicasa.
           69.
                         
          The little boys smile. Glass nods to Waki, then waves to Red
          Hawk and the Medicine Man. They return it... watch Glass
          climb onto his horse.
                         
          Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride out of the
          village.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride along a high
          ridge, surrounded by empty snow-covered wilderness. They
          have the world to themselves.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          Glass crouches over a shallow, five-foot long hole surrounded
          by deep snow. The hole is filled with small fires and rocks.
          And he's watching Spotted Horse and Three Feathers tossing
          rocks into their own matching holes, then dragging the dirt
          back into them. Spotted Horse throws a glance back to Glass,
          making sure he understands.
                         
          Glass nods... pulls the dirt back in, covering the flames.
          He watches Spotted Horse spread a blanket over the warm
          ground, then does the same. He sits on the mound of dirt...
          leans back against a tree... feels the warmth rise up from
          beneath him.
                         
          He nods to Spotted Horse, who is already resting under his
          blanket.
                         
                          GLASS
           Nice.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
                          (NODS)
           Nice.
                         
          Glass pulls the buffalo hide around himself... keeping watch.
                         
           SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd)
           Sleep. No Arikara.
                         
          Glass nods... but still doesn't close his eyes. Spotted
          Horse tosses his knife over beside Glass. Glass takes it...
          nods to Spotted Horse.
                         
           SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd)
           Me sleep.
           70.
                         
          Spotted Horse rolls over, turning his back on Glass...
          trusting him with the knife. Three Feathers does the same.
                         
          Glass just stares out into the night.
                         
                         
          INT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Dark and quiet... except for the SNORING of a few men.
          Fitzgerald sleeps on his cot. A shadow glides across him...
          hovers over his face.
                         
          Fitzgerald's eyes blink open.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          FITZGERALD'S POV...
                         
          ...on GLASS STANDING OVER HIM... his scarred face calm and
          deadly... raising a knife to drive down into Fitzgerald's
          chest.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           No... please.
                         
          But Glass swings the blade.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
                         
          And Spotted Horse shaking Glass awake from his dream. Glass'
          hand flies up, the knife gripped. But Spotted Horse grabs
          his arm... stops it in mid-swing... holds it until Glass
          realizes it was a dream... relaxes.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           We go.
                         
          Glass calms... nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - DAY
                         
          Just a small cluster of log buildings sitting along the banks
          of the Missouri. Dozens of tee-pees and tents are set up
          outside the complex.
                         
          Glass follows Spotted Horse and Three Feathers into the camp.
          BEGGING INDIANS and DRUNK TRAPPERS paw at the men as they
          ride past, pleading for handouts.
           71.
                         
          One of the Indians grabs for the hides. Three Feathers
          plants his foot in the Indian's chest... shoves him back into
          the snow.
                         
          They continue on... climb off their horses outside the
          TRADING POST. Three Feathers stays to guard the hides, as
          Spotted Horse and Glass enter.
                         
                         
          INT. TRADING POST - DAY
                         
          A small, dingy room lined with shelves, all stacked high with
          pots, pans, dry goods, whiskey, blankets, weapons... anything
          that can be traded. KIOWA BRAZEAU, (60's), French-Canadian,
          stands behind the counter... looks up when the BELL over the
          door RINGS... sees Spotted Horse with Glass behind.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           (thick French accent)
           Bon jour, Spotted Horse. You come
           with many hides I hope.
           (off Spotted Horse's nod)
           We make good trades then.
                         
          Brazeau's eyes lock on Glass... stares at him, unsure.
                         
                          BRAZEAU (CONT'D)
           Monsieur Glass?
                         
                          GLASS
           Good to see you again, Mr. Brazeau.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           Jesus Christ, what happened to your
           goddamned face?
                         
                          GLASS
           Had a tussle with a grizzly.
                         
          Glass shakes Brazeau's hand. Brazeau studies his face...
          notices the Bear Claw Necklace... smiles.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           And now the grizzly, he don't look
           so good either, eh?
                         
          Glass shakes his head.
                         
                          BRAZEAU (CONT'D)
           (off Spotted Horse)
           You run with the Sioux these days?
           72.
                         
                          GLASS
           They looked after me for a spell.
           I'm on my way to catch back up with
           Captain Henry... at Fort Union.
           Needed to trade for some supplies
           on the Company's credit if I could.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           Oui, of course. Anything you like.
                         
          Glass pulls down a KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE.
                         
                          GLASS
           We can start with this.
                         
                         
          INT. TRADING POST - LATER
                         
          Glass is loaded with gear. He signs a ticket for Brazeau.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           You can pick up the horse at the
           livery in the morning.
           (off Glass' nod)
           I wish I could give you a room for
           the night, but...
                         
          Brazeau looks to SEVERAL TRAPPERS standing across the room,
          glaring at Glass.
                         
                          BRAZEAU (CONT'D)
           I cannot risk the trouble of
           letting a colored stay inside.
                         
          Glass glances to the trappers... one of them spits in Glass'
          direction... makes some MONKEY SOUNDS... daring Glass to
          respond. Glass just turns away.
                         
                          GLASS
           Won't be the last night I sleep on
           the ground.
                         
          Glass nods to Brazeau, then walks out.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           Take care of that face, Glass.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRADING POST - DAY
                         
          Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit on their horses. The
          other horses are now packed with new goods. Glass
          approaches.
           73.
                         
                          GLASS
           (points to the tents)
           You stay here tonight?
                         
          Spotted Horse shakes his head... motions back toward the
          wilderness. Then he points to the trading post... the
          TRAPPERS.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Your people?
                         
          Glass looks back to all the white faces... trappers, drunks,
          prostitutes. He shakes his head.
                         
                          GLASS
           No.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           You come then.
                         
          Spotted Horse taps his own chest... points back the way they
          came. Glass hesitates, almost like he's considering it...
          then he shakes his head again... points the opposite way.
                         
                          GLASS
           Fort Union.
                         
          Spotted Horse stares at Glass a long beat, then...
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           You spend your life hunting enemy.
           Enemy wins.
                         
                          GLASS
           It will be over soon.
                         
          Then Glass pulls the Bear Claw Necklace off... hands it to
          Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse holds it... then proudly slides
          it over his head.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
                          (IN SIOUX)
           Thank you.
                         
          Spotted Horse raises his hand in goodbye, then spins his
          horse and starts away. Three Feathers does the same. Glass
          returns it... watches them ride off.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - NIGHT
                         
          Glass is in the trees beyond the tents and tee-pees...
          crouched on the ground...
           74.
          dragging the dirt back over the fire and rocks. He slides up
          onto the mound... feels the warmth, and smiles... just a
          little.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - MORNING
                         
          Glass rides a PAINT MARE along a ridge overlooking the river.
          Fort Brazeau stands in the distance behind him.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
                         
          Snowy and cold. Glass leads the line of riders through the
          snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION - EVENING
                         
          But you can't tell if it's day or night through the blizzard.
          Fitzgerald, Pig, Anderson, Bridger, Murphy and Stubby Joe
          trudge through the snow in their snowshoes... finally reach
          the bunkhouse.
                         
                         
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING
                         
          Anderson shoves the door closed against the wind... latches
          it. The men look worn and battered... wind-burnt faces,
          icicles in their beards.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I had enough of this cold as hell
           shit.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           What'd you figure when ya signed on
           outta that St. Louis whorehouse you
           was workin'? That you was headin'
           off to paradise?
                         
          Pig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald's expense.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I tell ya what I figured, I figured
           I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't
           freeze before I got it outta my
           pecker.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Figured wrong.
           75.
                         
          Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare... wants to throw more, but
          Bridger's returning the stare... hard... so Fitzgerald
          decides he'd better not push it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Waste a time to check traps in this
           weather... while Henry sits warmin'
           his ass on the stove in his office.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Why don't you go tell him that,
           Fitz? Then start your hike back to
           St. Louie.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Shit, I walked up here, I got no
           problem walkin' back.
                         
                          MURPHY
           Contracted for twelve months. We
           all did.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Henry can shove that contract up
           his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it
           for him.
                         
          The others laugh at Fitzgerald's rambling.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You don't think I will?
                         
          The men shake their heads. Fitzgerald grabs his gloves...
          starts strapping his snowshoes back on.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Just give that fat little whore
           you're so sweet on a couple extra
           bits... she'll have you thinkin'
           it's Spring already.
                         
          The men laugh as Fitzgerald walks out... leaves the door wide
          open for the cold wind to pour over the others. Pig scurries
          over, shoving it closed.
                         
          As the other men gather around a table to play cards, Bridger
          pulls a JOURNAL from under his cot... falls onto the cot, and
          starts writing.
                         
                         
          INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - EVENING
                         
          Fitzgerald enters... looks around the empty office.
           76.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Hello? Captain?
                         
          The place is empty. Fitzgerald eyes Henry's desk... then
          past his desk... to the SAFE... its door CRACKED OPEN...
          STACKS OF MONEY visible inside.
                         
          Fitzgerald glances around... looks back to that safe.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT
                         
          Dark and quiet. The snow has stopped.
                         
                         
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Fitzgerald eases up from his cot... looks around at the
          sleeping men.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT
                         
          Fitzgerald slips out of the bunkhouse door... across the
          compound... toward the front gate.
                         
           MURPHY (O.S.)
           Where're you headed?
                         
          Fitzgerald looks up... sees Murphy in the Blockhouse on
          sentry duty.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           To the river, Murphy.
                         
          Murphy squints down into the shadows.
                         
                          MURPHY
           That you, Fitzgerald?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Left my rifle down there... don't
           want it out all night.
                         
                          MURPHY
           That weren't too smart.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Just don't take a shot at me when I
           come back in.
                         
                          MURPHY
           We'll see.
           77.
                         
          Murphy waves Fitzgerald out.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Not that you'd hit me if you tried.
                         
          Murphy fakes a laugh... raises his rifle down at Fitzgerald.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          POV DOWN MURPHY'S RIFLE...
                         
          ...on Fitzgerald moving toward the river... disappearing into
          the darkness.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Out of sight from the fort. Fitzgerald slides the ANSTADT
          FROM UNDER HIS COAT... hurries down the bank... searches
          under the brush and snow... pulls out an OVERTURNED CANOE.
                         
          He drags it to the icy edge... slides it across the ice
          toward the middle of the river, where the water still hasn't
          frozen over. The ice CRACKS UNDER HIS FEET. Fitzgerald
          climbs in the canoe... pounds the ice with the oar, breaking
          it loose.
                         
          The current seeps through the cracks... catches the canoe,
          pulling it to the center of the wide river... sends
          Fitzgerald shooting south. He throws a glance back at the
          shadow of Fort Union in the distance... growing smaller.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Clear blue sky. The sun glistening off the snow-covered
          ground. Glass is bundled under furs, as he rides through the
          snowy trees.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          Tucked under the rooftop of trees. A small fire burns.
          Glass sits on his fire-bed, looking over a map.
                         
          An O.S. SNORT from the Paint Mare, tied to a tree. Glass
          looks over in time to see the horse's ears perk up.
                         
          With his eyes searching the darkness, Glass slowly reaches
          over... grabs his rifle. Then he drops to his stomach...
          slides backward into the brush.
           78.
                         
          Glass peers through the brush... the woods seem empty...
          until SEVERAL DARK SHAPES APPEAR... moving through the
          distant trees... coming straight toward Glass' camp.
                         
          Then an O.S. SNAP BEHIND GLASS... he glances back in time to
          see an ARIKARA WARRIOR SWINGING A HATCHET.
                         
          Glass spins his rifle... shoves it into the stomach of the
          Warrior as he swings... BOOM... the Warrior flies back.
                         
          The dark woods suddenly ERUPT IN WAR CRIES... Arikara appear
          from all sides... charge toward the camp.
                         
          Glass scrambles up... races toward the Paint Mare as ARROWS
          AND GUNSHOTS FLASH THROUGH THE AIR ALL AROUND HIM.
                         
          Glass swings up onto the Paint Mare... spots ELK'S TONGUE
          leading the charge... the necklace of ears hanging around his
          neck. And Elk's Tongue's eyes are locked on Glass... almost
          like he remembers him.
                         
          Glass takes off through the forest.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Glass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the
          trees... the animal's nostrils spread wide, pulling in all
          the oxygen it can.
                         
          Glass glances back... sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM... HORSES...
          ridden by Elk's Tongue and eight other warriors.
                         
          Glass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of
          speed from her legs... pushing her toward the clearing up
          ahead... throwing another glance back... then looking in
          front of him, and realizing it isn't a clearing at all...
                         
          ...it's the edge of the world.
                         
          The paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of
          ground... because she's just galloped off the side of a
          cliff.
                         
          The horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees, its
          legs flailing for something to stand on.
                         
          Glass drops the rifle to grip the horse's mane, hanging on
          for what seems an endless fall.
           79.
                         
          The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still
          on her back. The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she drops into the
          snow-covered trees, carrying Glass with her.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
                         
          And the horse comes crashing through the branches... the
          massive limbs slowing her fall... snapping off as her body
          hits and twists... tosses Glass away.
                         
          The Paint Mare continues her deadly descent, the trees
          tearing at her body... catching her head... SNAPPING her
          neck.
                         
          Glass slams off a branch... tumbles to the ground with a
          thud. The Paint Mare hits the snow beside him... very dead.
                         
          Glass struggles to breath... finally GASPS... sucks in the
          oxygen. He lays there a moment... stares up through the
          trees...
                         
          ...to Elk's Tongue and the others staring down from the top
          of the cliff... with no way to get to Glass.
                         
          Glass rises to his knees... glances around for his rifle...
          lost. He flinches with what must be broken ribs... drags
          himself up, and staggers to the horse... pulls his knife and
          cuts the snowshoes from the back of the saddle.
                         
          He throws the snowshoes over his shoulder... continues on,
          through the woods... alone... in the middle of nowhere...
          again.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
                         
          From high above... the small shape of Glass making his way
          over the snowy ground... heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
                         
          A makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri. Two
          ramshackle structures... the General Store and a tattered
          livery stable filled with horses.
           80.
                         
                         
          INT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY
                         
          More like a saloon that sells a few supplies. A gang of
          TRAPPERS drink and play cards. A RUNTY MAN stands behind the
          counter, watching them...
                         
          ...until the door blows open, and in steps Glass. He pulls
          the fur hat away from his face, and what a sight he is...
          scarred face stiff from the cold... ice frozen in his beard.
                         
          The room falls silent... everyone staring at Glass. Until
          TRAPPER #1 snorts a laugh. Glass limps to the counter. All
          eyes follow him.
                         
                          GLASS
           (struggling to make his
           frozen lips move)
           I'm Hugh Glass of...
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           We don't serve niggers.
                         
          Glass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then...
                         
                          GLASS
           Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company
           on my way to Fort Union.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           I don't care if you was with Lewis
           and Clark headed for the new world.
           We don't serve niggers.
                         
                          GLASS
           All I need is a horse and enough
           supplies to...
                         
                          TRAPPER
           Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause
           he ain't listenin' to you, Cees.
                         
                          GLASS
           ...to get me to Fort Union. I can
           sign a draft made good by Captain
           Henry.
                         
          The Runty Man just stares at Glass... grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           What the fuck happened to your
           face, boy? You try to slice all
           the black off?
           81.
                         
                          TRAPPER #2
           Maybe we oughta help him do it
           right.
                         
                          FAT TRAPPER
           Best get on your way, boy.
                         
          Glass stares back at the men for a long beat, then...
                         
                          GLASS
           I'm Hugh Glass of the Rocky
           Mountain Fur Company, and all I
           need is...
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           (to the trappers)
           Do you believe this shit?
                         
          Trapper #1 and Trapper #2 pull the SKINNING KNIVES from their
          belts... start toward Glass.
                         
                          FAT TRAPPER
           Hell, I warned ya.
                         
                          GLASS
           All I need...
                         
          And that's when Trapper #1 grabs for Glass, but in a flash of
          movement that catches them all off-guard, Glass has is own
          knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER TRAPPER #1's CHIN.
                         
          Everyone freezes.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           ...is a horse and enough supplies
           to get me to Fort Union.
                         
          Then Glass slides Trapper #1's PISTOL from his belt... aims
          it at the other men.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           And this shooter here. All made
           good by Captain Henry and The Rocky
           Mountain Fur Company.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
                         
          The snow pours down on the Runty Man and the trappers, as
          they stand outside, rifles aimed into the distance.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Shoot him, goddammit!
           82.
                         
                          TRAPPER #2
           I can't get a clear look.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Shoot `em both!
                         
          The Runty Man snatches one of the rifles... BOOM... fires a
          wild shot past the riders.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS - GALLOPING AWAY ON HORSEBACK...
                         
          ...with Trapper #1 sitting backward on the horse behind him.
          Glass has the pistol jammed into his ribs, and keeps glancing
          back to the men growing smaller behind him.
                         
          Finally, Glass shoves the man off the back of the horse.
          Trapper #1 tumbles into the snow.
                         
          The RUMBLE OF DISTANT GUNSHOTS... too far away to reach
          Glass, who just keeps racing north.
                         
                          CUT TO:

                          RUNTY MAN
           Get after the son of a bitch!
                         
          The trappers exchange glances... don't move.
                         
                          TRAPPER #2
           It's cold as hell, Cees.
                         
                          FAT TRAPPER
           And he did say to put it all on the
           Rocky Mountain tab.
                         
          The Runty Man glares at the trappers.

          Stubby Bill sits dozing in a chair, his rifle across his lap.
          O.S. CRUNCHING... getting louder... loud enough to nudge
          Stubby Bill awake. He sits up... peers over the wall, but
          can't see anything in the fog... just hears the CRUNCHING
          MOVING CLOSER... FOOTSTEPS IN THE CRISP SNOW.

          ...on the blanket of fog hanging in the air... that same
          CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS... growing clearer... a FIGURE
          walking... leading a horse behind him... appearing out of the
          mist like a ghost... GLASS.
                         
          STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK...
                         
          ...sure his eyes are betraying him. But then Glass looks
          straight up at Stubby Bill, and there's no doubt.

          Dark and quiet... just Pig's snoring rattling the silence.
          Suddenly the door kicks open... SLAMS into the wall... and
          there's GLASS' SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY.
                         
          GROANS from the awakened men... hands moving through the dark
          for oil lamps... turning them bright... until the room's
          fully lit... and they all see Glass standing there... eyes
          floating across the room, searching for a target.
                         
          The men just stare back at him, like they're all part of the
          same dream.
                         
          Except for Bridger, who's propped up in his cot like he's
          been waiting all night... waiting every night... for Glass to
          appear in that doorway.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Glass raises the stolen pistol... aims it at Bridger. And
          the young man doesn't flinch... almost as if he wants to make
          sure Glass doesn't miss.
           84.
                         
          The other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell's
          going on.
                         
          Glass holds his aim on Bridger's face... a face that's
          haunted him... kept him alive.
                         
                          GLASS
           You took everything I had... left
           me to die.
                         
          Glass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised... each step
          of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an
          executioner's drum.
                         
          MUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach
          Bridger... stand over him, the pistol aimed down.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Why?
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I was scared of dyin'.
                          (BEAT)
           But every day since, I've wished I
           had.
                         
          Glass' finger tightens on the trigger, ready to make
          Bridger's wish come true.
                         
          The rest of the bunkhouse watches this execution in wide-
          eyed, stone silence, afraid to move.
                         
                          GLASS
           There wasn't no `Ree that night,
           was there?
                         
          A long beat, then...
                         
                          BRIDGER
           No.
                         
          Glass PISTOL WHIPS BRIDGER, knocking him to the floor. And
          before Bridger can crawl away, Glass in over him... those
          aching, frozen fists beating mercilessly down on Bridger.
                         
          And Bridger doesn't fight back... just does his best to cover
          up, but the blows keep coming, and Bridger's face is covered
          in blood...
                         
          ...just as Henry runs inside, half-dressed from where Stubby
          Bill awoke him. Henry grabs Glass... pulls him off.
                         
          Glass spins... jams his pistol right in Henry's face.
           85.
                         
                          HENRY
           Hugh. Wait.
                         
          Glass is crazy with rage... barely stops himself from pulling
          that trigger. But finally, he calms... his arm sinks,
          lowering his aim. He glances around the bunkhouse.
                         
                          GLASS
           Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle?
                         
                          HENRY
           Deserted two days ago. Along with
           about five hundred dollars of
           company money.
                          (BEAT)
           Let's get some coffee to warm you
           up.
           (to Glass, but looking at
                          BRIDGER)
           I wanna hear what happened.
                         
          Glass looks back to Bridger... they hold a long stare, until
          Glass walks out.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Wait. Please!
                         
          But Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all
          those eyes burning into him. Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig
          just lowers his eyes... can't even look at the boy.
                         
          The men step into their boots and furs... file out after
          Glass and Henry... leaving Bridger alone in the bunkhouse.
                         
                         
          INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass sits by the warmth of the stove, sipping coffee.
          Henry's behind he desk, with the other men scattered around.
                         
                          GLASS
           I cut the shoes loose of her, and
           hiked over to Fort Talbot.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Christ almighty.
                         
                          GLASS
           And you may hear from the fella
           there about a stoled horse and
           supplies charged to you.
           86.
                         
                          HENRY
           We'll take care of it. You should
           go settle in.
                         
                          MURPHY
           There's a couple fair whores next
           door that'll ease the miles on ya,
           scars or not.
                         
          Stubby Bill gives Murphy an elbow.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Jesus, Murph.
                         
                          MURPHY
           I just meant I'd go roust one of
           `em for ya if you wanted.
                         
                          GLASS
           She can take the night off, but I
           wouldn't mind the use of her bed.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (TO MURPHY)
           Go clear out a room. The rest head
           on back to bunk.
                         
          Murphy hustles out. The others move toward the door, each
          stopping to shake Glass' hand, or give him a pat on the back.
                         
                          PIG
           I told ya I'd see ya up here. You
           remember that, Hugh?
                         
                          GLASS
           I do, Pig. You must have a little
           gypsy in ya.
                         
          Pig grins and nods.
                         
                          PIG
           I'll see ya in the mornin'.
                         
          Pig exits, leaving just Glass and Henry, sitting in a beat of
          silence, until...
                         
                          HENRY
           Can I talk you outta what you're
           planning?
                         
          Glass doesn't answer... just stands, placing the coffee cup
          on the table.
           87.
                         
                          GLASS
           Thank you for what you done for
           me... stitchin' me back together...
           givin' me a chance.
                         
                          HENRY
           I'm offerin' you another right
           now... to stay here... let this
           thing go.
                         
                          GLASS
                          (BEAT)
           He thinks he let me die. But he
           don't know that he's the one that's
           kept me alive... for the chance of
           findin' him... makin' him pay for
           what he done.
                         
                          HENRY
           The law will make Fitzgerald pay.
                         
          Glass stares out the window... his SCARRED REFLECTION stares
          back at him.
                         
                          GLASS
           You told me once that other men
           didn't think like him.
                          (BEAT)
           But the truth is, most do. I seen
           it my whole life... the looks folks
           give... the whisperin'. I watched
           my wife and son die from the fever
           on accounta no white doctor would
           care for `em. Wasn't no different
           to them than if their neighbor's
           dog was sick.
                          (BEAT)
           So I don't figure nobody's gonna
           care much that Fitzgerald took some
           dyin' nigger's rifle, and left him
           in the middle of nowhere.
           (turns to Henry)
           Do you, Captain?
                         
          Henry doesn't answer... because he knows Glass is right.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           I thank you for the coffee.
                         
          Glass walks out. Henry just sits there.
           88.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION - DAY
                         
          Glass, Pig and Murphy stand by Glass' horse, as he ties off
          his supplies.
                         
                          MURPHY
           He said he was goin' to get his
           rifle...
                         
          And then Murphy catches himself... shrugs.
                         
                          MURPHY (CONT'D)
           Your rifle. But he never showed
           back up. The next day I figured
           him mighta fell in, but then Pig
           seen the canoe was missin'.
                         
                          PIG
           And the Captain found the money
           gone.
                         
                          GLASS
           I'll make my way down river. See
           what turns up.
                         
          Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse. Stubby Bill
          comes waddling toward them.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           The kid's gone... gear and all.
           Musta slipped out before light.
                         
          Stubby Bill waves Bridger's journal at them.
                         
           STUBBY BILL (cont'd)
           Just left this on his bunk.
                         
          Henry takes the journal... flips it open.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (READING)
           "Every day I think about what I
           done. I want to tell Pig and the
           others the truth but am afraid what
           they'll think of me. I look at
           Fitzgerald and want to kill him but
           am afraid to try. I am a coward
           and wish he hadn't been lyin about
           the Ree that night. I wish they
           had come and kilt us both."
                         
          Glass considers the words a beat, then swings onto his horse.
           89.
                         
                          GLASS
           If I run across the boy, I'll send
           him back your way.
                         
          Glass sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Where're you headed?
                         
                          HENRY
           Fitzgerald stole five hundred
           dollars. Rocky Mountain Fur
           Company wants him too.
                         
                          GLASS
           I can do this on my own.
                         
                          HENRY
           I know you can. But maybe you
           won't have to.
                         
          Glass stares at Henry a beat, then finally just pulls his
          horse around... heads for the river. Henry nods to Pig and
          Murphy as he follows after Glass.

          From above Fort Union. Our POV on Glass and Henry riding
          south along the icy river.
                         
          And then we see our POV is Bridger's... standing along the
          ledge, loaded with all his gear. He watches the riders
          another moment, then turns... hikes the opposite direction...
          leaving Fort Union behind forever.

          The Runty Man behind the counter. A few of the same Trappers
          drinking... playing cards. Just another day at Fort Talbot.
                         
          The door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           We ain't got no food to spare,
           friend, if that's what you're
           lookin' for.
                         
          The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it's Fitzgerald...
          cold and miserable.
           90.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Then what the hell have ya got?
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Whiskey and blankets mostly.
           Weather's held back deliveries.
                         
          Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Gimme a couple bottles then.
           Goddamn ice shredded my boat. Been
           walkin' for two days.
                         
          The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles. Fitzgerald pops
          one... gulps some down.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)

                          FITZGERALD
           Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain
           Fur Company's good for it.
                         
          And those words stop everything. The Trappers all turn from
          their game. The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           You're the second son of a bitch
           come in here makin' that claim.
           And the first one left a bad taste.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           That right? Well I don't know
           nothin' about that. Just that I
           need a horse.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           So did this other fella. So he
           stole one... along with Lange's
           pistola.
                         
          Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Fine then, I'll pay cash for the
           horse. How much?
           91.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           How `bout you pay for your friend's
           too.
                         
                          TRAPPER #1
           And my shooter.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Wasn't my friend.
                         
          Trapper #1 stands up.
                         
                          TRAPPER #1
           Then from where I stand, you don't
           got no friends at all.
                         
          The other Trappers glare at Fitzgerald. The Runty Man just
          grins that toothless smile of his. Fitzgerald's in a bind,
          and he knows it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Yeah, okay. I'll collect from him.
           How much?
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           How `bout we say eighty...
           (sees Fitzgerald doesn't
                          ARGUE)
           ...five.
                         
          Fitzgerald starts digging into his pocket.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You boys are leavin' me with
           nothin'. Better be a helluva
           horse.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Pick of the litter.
                         
          The Runty Man snatches the cash.
                         
           RUNTY MAN (cont'd)
           And when you see that scarred-up
           nigger, you tell him he'd best not
           show up here again.
                         
          Fitzgerald freezes... not sure he heard correctly.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           When I see who?
           92.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           The black son of a bitch that
           robbed me. You tell him that.
                         
          A long beat, then...
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Scarred up, you say... and headed
           up to Union?
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           That's what he told us. Seemed
           real anxious to get there too.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (NODS)
           I'll make sure to give him the
           message when I find him.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
                         
          Fitzgerald sits on the horse, staring back over the ground...
          his LINE OF TRACKS LEADING THROUGH THE SNOW. He turns...
          looks south, then back to the tracks.
                         
          Finally, Fitzgerald digs his heels into the horse. The
          animal takes off, right along Fitzgerald's tracks in the
          snow... right back toward Glass.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - DAY
                         
          Thick ice along the edges, tapering to a narrow stream of
          flowing water at the very center.
                         
          Glass and Henry ride along the snow-covered bank.
                         
                          HENRY
           Hugh.
                         
          Henry points. Glass follows his finger along the river... to
          a CANOE resting on the bank ahead. They dismount... examine
          the canoe... the letters "RMFC" painted on the side.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           That's it.
                         
          Glass runs his mittened hand along the gashes in the wood.
                         
                          GLASS
           Ice tore it up.
           93.
                         
          Glass looks to the FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW, leading deep into
          the trees. He glances up to the sky... clear and blue.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           If the snow holds off, we'll have a
           good trail to track.
                         
                          HENRY
           What's out that direction? Talbot?
                         
                          GLASS
           And the Missouri. Doubt he'd risk
           the river with the `Ree. Likely
           grab a horse, and cross over
           high... take his chances goin' east
           against the weather. When'd you
           say he skipped out?
                         
                          HENRY
           Three days ago now.
                         
                          GLASS
           We best pick up our pace.
                         
          They climb back onto their horses... trot into the trees.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
                         
          Glass and Henry gallop across, their path dead on
          Fitzgerald's tracks.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          The snow is shallow here, the ground protected by the trees.
          There's a black spot where a fire once burned, and footprints
          all over the place. Glass is off his horse, crouched,
          studying the site... lifting the charred chunks of wood.
                         
                          HENRY
           This was Fitzgerald camped here?
                         
                          GLASS
           Couple nights back. But these
           tracks aren't all his.
                         
                          HENRY
           He's travelin' with somebody?
           94.
                         
                          GLASS
           (shakes his head)
           Came in after. Prints are smooth.
           Mocassins.
                         
          Henry throws Glass a look... he knows what that means.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Could be Sioux... Blackfoot even.
                         
                          HENRY
           But you figure they're `Ree.
                         
                          GLASS
           I don't figure nothin', Captain.
           But whoever it is, they're a good
           day behind Fitzgerald.
                         
          Glass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away
          from camp. Henry rides after him.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           And they're on his trail too, so we
           should keep it quiet... don't
           announce we're back here.
                         
                          HENRY
           You told me once you knew enough to
           keep away from the `Ree.
                         
                          GLASS
           I do.
                         
                          HENRY
           You figure this is smart then?
                         
          Glass swings up onto his horse.
                         
                          GLASS
           You're welcome to head back,
           Captain.
                         
          Glass trots off. Henry watches him a beat, then throws a
          glance into the trees... follows after Glass.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          Glass kneels on the ground, building a fire-bed... dragging
          the dirt over the fire and rocks. Henry's under a blanket,
          watching him.
           95.
                         
                          HENRY
           What if we find Fitzgerald... and I
           ask you not to do this?
                         
          Glass spreads a blanket over the ground.
                         
                          GLASS
           Don't ask me.
                         
          Glass settles in on the warm earth. Henry just keeps
          watching him.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER
                         
          ANGLE ON HENRY...
                         
          ...asleep under the blanket. O.S. RUSTLING sends his eyes
          flashing open. He raises up... rifle ready.
                         
          He glances at Glass, who puts a finger over his lips.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (WHISPERS)
           `Ree?
                         
          Glass doesn't answer... just keeps searching the brush.
                         
          Henry's groggy eyes dart around the night... spots MOVEMENT
          IN THE BRUSH.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           There!
                         
                          GLASS
           Wait!
                         
          But it's too late... Henry fires... BOOM... the shot explodes
          through the night...
                         
          ...and the DEER leaps away.
                         
          Henry looks to Glass... shakes his head... sorry.
                         
                          HENRY
           So much for stayin' quiet.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           96.
                         
                         
          FITZGERALD - SQUATTING BESIDE A SMALL FIRE...
                         
          ...staring out into the darkness, as the GUNSHOT ECHOES OVER
          HIM. Fitzgerald immediately throws dirt over the flames.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          Glass and Henry are loaded up, back on their horses.
                         
                          HENRY
           Guess you would've been better off
           on your own.
                         
                          GLASS
           We needed to pick up some time
           anyways.
                         
          The two riders disappear into the dark trees.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT
                         
          Glass and Henry riding across a meadow. Glass stops... tilts
          his head back to sniff the air.
                         
                          HENRY
           Whatta ya got?
                         
                          GLASS
           Smoke.
                         
          Glass pulls some snow from his horse's mane... tosses it in
          the air, and watches it blow to the side.
                         
          Glass turns his horse toward the breeze... squints out into
          the night.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           No more than mile out that way.
           (pulls his rifle)
           I'll head in from the west... you
           take the east.
                         
                          HENRY
           What if it's `Ree?
                         
                          GLASS
           Then we leave `em be... meet back
           up here.
           97.
                         
          Henry nods... Glass takes off at a trot. Henry veers the
          other direction... splitting up across the snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Splinters of moonlight shoot through the pines. Glass on
          horseback, walking through the trees... appearing and
          disappearing.
                         
          He spots something in the distance... the slightest of glows.
          Glass eases off his horse... wraps the reins around a branch.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          Henry's already off his horse... leading it through the
          trees... searching as he walks.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Glass moves silently through the darkness... rifle poised to
          aim and fire... just like the first time we saw him,
          perfectly comfortable in this world.
                         
          His eyes shine in the darkness, drifting back and forth...
          picking up everything.
                         
          He reaches the glow... the remains of a campfire. The
          slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air. Glass
          crouches down, studying the surround ground... HOOF-PRINTS
          blended in with the other tracks.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          Henry's horse is making too much noise with each step. He
          stops walking... wraps the reins around a tree... walks back
          around the horse...
                         
          ...AND THERE'S FITZGERALD STARING AT HIM...
                         
          ...Glass' Anstadt aimed and ready to fire.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Didn't figure an important man like
           you to be away from your stove on a
           night as cold as this, Captain.
           You lost?
                         
          Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle. His
          eyes drift to his own rifle, still strapped onto his saddle.
           98.
                         
                          HENRY
           I'm here to save your life.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I done told you boys... I don't
           need savin' by you or nobody else.
                         
          Henry knows he's only got one chance... he makes a grab for
          the rifle.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Glass running his fingers across the tracks. Suddenly an
          O.S. GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE. Glass spins to it...
          races back through the trees toward his horse.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Glass at full gallop through the woods... veering between
          trees... ducking branches.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          Glass charges from the forest... spots Henry's horse standing
          in the trees... tears through the snow toward it... leaps off
          the still-moving animal in a fluid slide... hits the ground
          with his rifle ready...
                         
          ...and sees HENRY'S BODY face-up in the snow.
                         
          Glass drops to a knee... scans the darkness, as he slides
          over to Henry...
                         
          ...and we see he's a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his
          chest leaking out onto the snow... HIS HEAD SCALPED... LEFT
          EAR SLICED OFF.
                         
          Glass stands back up, turning in a circle, as he peers into
          the distance around him. But there's nothing out there.
          Glass SCREAMS in rage.
                         
          He turns back to Henry... crouches down over him.
                         
                          GLASS
           You shouldn't a come.
                         
          As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something... takes Henry
          by the chin, and tilts his head. And HENRY'S RIGHT EAR HAS
          BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL.
           99.
                         
          Glass stares at Henry a beat, then squints out into the
          forest.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           (repeating Spotted Horse's
           words under his breath)
           Arikara take right ear of Sioux.
           Left ear of whites. Not know what
           they take from you.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT
                         
          Glass on horseback, leading Henry's horse behind him across
          the snow-covered meadow. Henry's fur-covered body is draped
          over the saddle.
                         
                         
          EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a
          bit at the center. Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at
          the thick ice to get to the water beneath. He makes a
          hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into
          the darkness.
                         
          Then Glass turns... stares up a slope into the dark forest
          beyond... like he knows what's waiting for him there.
                         
          He walks to the horses, tied in the trees at the base of the
          slope... Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in
          his bloody furs.
                         
          Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE... looks back up that
          slope.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST...
                         
          ...watching from the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over
          the distant slope... riding through the trees, with Henry
          draped over the horse behind.
                         
          The forest is quiet... just the CRACKING of crusty snow and
          branches under the horses' hooves.
                         
          Then BOOM... as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN'T SEEN BESIDE US
          FLASHES IN THE NIGHT...
                         
          ...and Glass tumbles off his horse.
           100.
                         
          The horses prance around with a start, then settle... and
          then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US... eases
          toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves.
                         
          He reaches Glass, face down in the snow... his furs covering
          him.
                         
          And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to
          suddenly roll over firing...
                         
          ...but Glass doesn't move. Fitzgerald nudges him with his
          boot, then crouches down... grabs Glass by the shoulder, and
          pulls him over...
                         
          ...and there's HENRY'S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE
          FURS... and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back.
                         
                         
          ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY'S HORSE...
                         
          ...on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS' SADDLE to hold
          Henry upright...
                         
          ...and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second
          horse... MOVING... the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a
          rifle... the head raising up... it's GLASS... taking aim...
                         
          ...as Fitzgerald realizes what's happened... spins with the
          Anstadt...
                         
          ...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on
          Fitzgerald... BOOM... BOOM... both rifles explode...
                         
          ...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush.
                         
          Fitzgerald's wild shot hits Henry's horse, sending it rearing
          up, tossing Glass to the ground.
                         
          But Glass is on his feet in a flash... reloading as he
          charges into the brush...
                         
          ...but FITZGERALD IS GONE.
                         
          Until the flash of movement behind Glass... he turns... as
          the butt of the Anstadt whips through the air... WHACK...
          clubs him across the head, sending him tumbling down the
          slope to the frozen river.
                         
          Fitzgerald swings the Anstadt back over his BLOODY SHOULDER,
          snatches up his knife, and charges down the slope to finish
          Glass off.
           101.
                         
                         
          EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Glass lies on the ice, barely conscious. Blood oozes down
          his head... over his eyes. He wipes it away to see
          Fitzgerald barreling down toward him.
                         
          Fitzgerald dives in attack, but Glass kicks up his leg,
          sending Fitzgerald flying over... SLAMMING into the frozen
          river, his head CRACKING THE ICE.
                         
          Glass rips the knife from his belt... moves after Fitzgerald,
          his feet slipping and sliding under him.
                         
          Fitzgerald rises to his feet... the men charge like two wild
          animals... crash into each other... knives flailing.
                         
          They roll along the ice, blades glistening... slicing through
          furs... across flesh.
                         
          Fitzgerald thrusts his knife down... plants it through the
          back of Glass' hand, pinning it to the ice. Glass CRIES
          OUT... drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald's out. As he
          does, Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face, sending him sailing
          back... sliding to the center of the river.
                         
          The thin ice around him splinters... cracks. Glass looks
          up... sees Fitzgerald stalking toward him, HOLDING BOTH
          KNIVES now. Glass is trapped...
                         
          ...until he pounds his elbow down on the weakened ice... it
          begins to give... he pounds it again and again... Fitzgerald
          speeds up to get to Glass in time... raises one of the
          knives, as Glass shatters the ice... drops beneath the
          surface.
                         
          Fitzgerald rushes after him, but the ice cracks under his
          feet, forcing him back.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          UNDERWATER...
                         
          ...and Glass just under the ice, floating with the current.
          His fingers search for a hole, but there's nothing.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           102.
                         
                         
          FITZGERALD...
                         
          ...making his way down the river, peering through the ice,
          searching for Glass. He spots something... stops... leans
          close to make out the shape... it's GLASS' FEET.
                         
          Then suddenly, GLASS' FIST EXPLODES THROUGH THE ICE AT
          FITZGERALD'S FEET... grab Fitzgerald's leg, pulling him down.
                         
          Fitzgerald crashes to the ice... it splinters around him...
          gives away, and he sinks into the icy water... but the
          ANSTADT STRAPPED AROUND HIM CATCHES ON THE ICE... holds him
          against the current.
                         
          Glass drags himself from the water... stands... stares down
          at Fitzgerald trapped in the hole... his face looking up at
          Glass through the ice. Glass lifts one of the fallen
          knives... stands over Fitzgerald.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (through the water and
                          ICE)
           Help me!
           (off Glass' stare)
           Glass... please!
                         
          Glass hesitates a beat, staring at him, just as he did with
          Bridger that night in the bunkhouse. And then Glass leans
          down... grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up.
                         
          Except Glass SLICES THE BLADE ACROSS THE STRAP OF THE
          ANSTADT, sending Fitzgerald floating away under the ice, as
          Glass holds on to the Anstadt.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          FITZGERALD...
                         
          ...floating under the surface... pounding at the ice as he
          drifts, until his swinging slows... stops... his body drifts
          away.
                         
                         
          EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Glass stands on the ice, blood dripping down his face,
          holding his Anstadt. He begins to tremble... not from the
          cold, but from finally reaching the end of this journey. His
          eyes begin to fill with tears...
           103.
                         
          ...and then he sees ELK'S TONGUE, and SEVERAL OTHER ARIKARA
          WARRIORS watching him from the other side of the river.
                         
          Glass and Elk's Tongue exchange a long stare, until finally
          Glass SCREAMS OUT.
                         
                          GLASS
           I am Tatanka Wicasa! I have killed
           whites and I have killed Arikara
           and I have killed grizzly! AND I
           WILL KILL YOU!
                         
          Elk's Tongue doesn't move... just stares back at Glass...
          soaked in blood and water. Then Glass CRIES OUT at the
          warriors again.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           COME ON!
                         
          But the Arikara don't attack... don't move at all... until
          Elk's Tongue gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS, then turns...
          they disappear back into the trees.
                         
          Glass watches them fade away, then collapses to his knees on
          the icy river... exhausted in every possible way.
                         
          He begins to cry.
                         
           FADE OUT.
                         
                         
                          THE END

           JACK (V.O.)
           Darkness. That's the first thing I
           remember. It was dark, and it was
           cold. And I was scared.
                         
          The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of
          light, refracted through water, which turns into...
                         
                         
          A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICE
                         
          The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above
          begins to spider-web and crack.
                         
                         
          EXT. FROZEN POND - NIGHT
                         
          Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond
          continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A
          young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense
          moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his
          tousled hair frosted white.
                         
           JACK (V.O.)
           But then...then I saw the moon. It
           was so big and it was so bright,
           and it seemed to chase the darkness
           away. And when it did...I wasn't
           scared anymore.
                         
          Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
          underneath him.
           JACK (V.O.)
           Why I was there, and what I was
           meant to do - that I've never
           known. And a part of me wonders if
           I ever will.
                         
          Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight
          as it dims a bit.
                         
          Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something
          with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden
          staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the
          staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.
           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2.
                         
                         
          Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
          contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across
          the ice. Jack is visibly confused.
                         
          He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
          trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as
          he begins to run across the frozen pond.
                         
          Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the
          air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
          earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
          and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURGESS SETTLEMENT - TOWN CENTER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs.
          Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands
          up, still elated, and brushes himself off.
                         
          As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their
          hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.
                         
                          JACK
           (to the townsfolk)
           Hello. Hello. Good evening,
           ma'am.
                          (BEAT)
           Ma'am?
                         
          The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches
          down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him.
                         
                          JACK
           Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me
           where I am?
                         
          The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack
          staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had
          been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.
                         
                          JACK
           Hello! Hello!
                         
          Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his
          presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.
                         
           JACK (V.O.)
           My name is Jack Frost -- how do I
           know that? The moon told me so.
           But that was all he ever told me.
           And that was a long, long time ago.

          trees.

          EXT. NORTH POLE - DUSK
                         
          FIERY GYPSY VIOLIN MUSIC as we move through clouds to reveal
          a MASSIVE ICE CANYON, and just around a bend, the incredible
          hidden fortress of NORTH, aka SANTA CLAUS.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH'S WORKSHOP - DUSK
                         
          We glimpse a familiar-looking RED JACKET and CAP with white
          trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block of
          ice onto a stone work table--
                         
          IN QUICK CUTS: A CHAINSAW shears the block in half, spraying
          ice. North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo
          on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible.
                         
          Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies,
          each licking their own tasty morsel.
                         
           NORTH (O.S.)
           Still waiting for cookies!
                         
          As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies
          from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear.
                         
          The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself
          across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge
          HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing
          a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music,
          delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve
          tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible--
                         
          His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a
          delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice--
                         
          His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An
          ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the
          track, picking up speed--
                         
                          NORTH
           Yes!
                         
          North's hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two
          Elves.

          One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the
          plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then
          unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out
          onto the plate.
                         
                          NORTH
           Ah, finally!
                         
          He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles
          as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair
          -- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and the
          train lifts off the track--
                         
          Suddenly, the DOOR is thrown open by one of North's concerned
          YETIS, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the
          floor in pieces.

           Ach!
                         
          The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame. North cries
          out, devastated. The yeti, equally emotional, lets out
          another whimper. North looks down at the broken toy and
          takes a moment to collect himself.
                         
                          NORTH

           What...? The Globe?
                         
          North leaps up -- draws a HUGE SCIMITAR from its sheath and
                         HEADS OUT--
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH'S GLOBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A sea of tiny BELLS on the heads of panicking elves part as
          North's huge boots stomp through.

          Covered with LIGHTS blanketing the continents. But North
          notices that all at once, HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS suddenly go out.
                         
                          NORTH
           What is this?
                         
          Now MORE LIGHTS, in GREATER NUMBERS, as if something is
          snuffing them out by the thousands. North's concern grows.

          Before the Yeti can finish, a WIND whips up from out of
          nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of SWIRLING
          BLACK SAND, crawls over the lights, and shrouds the ENTIRE
          GLOBE in inky DARKNESS--
                         
          The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the BLACK SAND
          WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as
          the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates
          into the air --
                         
          As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to
          the ground, and the globes lights come back on, North whirls
          to see a HUGE SHADOW flash across the floors and curving
          walls of his fortress. It quickly disappears, leaving
          nothing but the distant ECHO of...LAUGHTER?
                         
          North is frozen, looking up into the darkness, gravely:
                         
                          NORTH
           Can it be?

           Dingle!
                         
          A group of elves step forward gleefully pointing to
          themselves, as if they're all "Dingle". The excitement
          quickly turns to confusion.

          The fairies' tweets turn to concern, turning Tooth's
          attention to North's AURORA SIGNAL stretching across the sky.
          She gasps, and flies off like a rocket toward the source of
          the signal, accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies.

           My fellow Guardians - It is our job
           to watch over the children of the
           world, and keep them safe - to
           bring wonder, hope and dreams.
           And so, I've called us all here for
           one reason, and one reason only -
           the children are in danger.
                         
          Much of this we hear over the following...
                         
                         
          EXT./INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM
                         
          We pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a
          stream of sand swirling overhead. It's a dream and it's taken
          the shape of a child playing soccer.
                         
          We FOLLOW the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into the
          sky where we see DOZENS of strands of sand descending to
          earth. Keep following up, through majestic CLOUDS...
                         
          ...to reveal a small, GLOWING GOLDEN CLOUD of Dreamsand
          shimmering among the clouds, trailing the golden threads.
                         
          The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure,
          THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The
          Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned.
                         
          Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud
          suddenly SWIRLS around him, changing form into a small
          BIPLANE, with Sandy in the cockpit. He BARREL ROLLS the
          plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular cloudscape
          and flies off into the distance.

          A few EASTER EGGS pop up out of the ground; their little legs
          carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object.
                         
          Speeding along through a subterranean tunnel, we can barely

          A hole opens in the snow, and a pair of rabbit ears pops out.
          A huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow, annoyed.
          The six foot tall figure is BUNNYMUND.

          A hooded figure with a familiar looking staff rests atop a
          Post Office box on the opposite end of the street. The man
          touches the staff to the ground, sending a streak of frost
          across the street.
                         
          A RUSSIAN BOY approaches a water fountain, turns the handle
          and moves in for a sip. But as he does, the water freezes
          magically, and the boy's tongue is stuck to the frozen water.
          His friends can't help but laugh.

          A mail man walks across the street and a PATCH OF ICE
          magically appears under his feet. He scrambles, and BOOM! -
          lands on his butt. Just behind the man, we see the TRAIL OF
          FROST climb up the side of a building. We stay on the frost
          as it moves up along a rain pipe, and through the windows we
          see...

          A boy try to feed his gold fish, but a layer of ice suddenly
          forms along the water surface and prevents the fish from
          reaching its food. We move along the side of the building...
                         
          A writer in his study sits next to stacks of papers. The
          window suddenly swings open and a gust of wind sends the
          pages flying out the window. We move along the building,
          across clothes lines and power lines as they freeze.
                         
          We continue to move up, and finally discover the culprit.
          Jack Frost makes his way atop a cathedral spire and takes in

          Jack chuckles as he calls the wind. The trees begin to sway
          and leaves fly into the air. Jack grabs hold of the spire,
          smiling as the wind blows past.

          Jack lets go and the wind carries him into the air and
          through the clouds. Night turns to day as Jack flies from

          perfect snowball.
                         
          He then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy

          Suddenly we see Caleb struck in the side of the head with one
          of Jack's snowballs; Claude can't help but laugh.
                         
                          JACK
           Free for all!
                         
          And just like that we find ourselves in a take-no-prisoners
          snowball fight, the kids pummeling each other mercilessly.
                         
                          JACK
           Alright, who needs ammo?
                         
          Jack supplies the kids with more snowballs. The kids are
          loving this.
                         
                          JACK
                          (WALLA)
           Look at that.
                         
          The mayhem continues as Jamie, using his sled as a shield, is
          knocked backward into a snowman, crushing it underneath him.
          A snowball flies overhead and hits CUPCAKE, a tough third
          grader as wide as she is tall, in the back of the head.
                         
          Dread sets in amongst the other kids, Cupcake squints -
          gunslinger eyes.

                          PIPPA
           Crud, I hit Cupcake.
                         
                          MONTY
           She hit Cupcake.
                         
                          CLAUDE
           You hit Cupcake?
                         
          Jamie is flat on his back, terrified. He looks up to see
          Cupcake standing over him. Then, BOOF! Jack hits Cupcake
          with a magical snowball. The kids gasp in horror.
                         
                          CLAUDE
           Oh!
                         
                          CALEB
           Did you throw that?
                         
                          MONTY
           No.
                         
                          PIPPA
           Wasn't me.
                         
          A moment, and then Cupcake starts laughing as Jack's magic
          takes hold.
                         
          Cupcake chases the kids down the hill, holding the head of
          her snowman in her hands. Jack, all the while, runs along
          side taking pleasure in the excitement.
                         
                          JAMIE

                          JACK
           Ooh, little slippery!
                         
          Jack jumps ahead, blasting a sheet of ice behind him. The
          kids fall to the ground, except for Jamie, who lands on his
          sled, and slides head first down the sheet of ice into town.

                          (WALLA)

           Jamie! Turn, turn! That's the
           street! What are you doing? Stop!
           There's traffic!
                         
          Jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past
          a set of parked cars.
                         
          Jack's path of ice covers the street. As Jamie turns, his
          speed only escalates, sending him directly into traffic.
          Jamie barely misses a moving truck, spinning it out of
          control, sending furniture out the back, and causing a four
          car pile up.
                         
                          JAMIE
           Whoa!
                         
                          JACK
           Whoa, don't worry kid, I gotcha.
                         
          Jamie looks back, then quickly ahead as terror comes into his
          eyes. Jack can't help but smile.
                         
                          JACK
           Hold on. It's gonna be alright.
                         
                          JAMIE
           Ahhhh. No, no, no, no...
                         
                          JACK
           Keep up with me kid! Take a left.
                         
          Jamie rockets through a pedestrian intersection, narrowly
          missing those in the crosswalk.

           Whoa, no, no, no, no...
                         
          Jack flies over to the far side of the street, sending the
          streak of ice and Jamie up onto the sidewalk.

                          JACK
           There you go!
                         
                          JAMIE
           No! No!
                         
           PEDESTRIAN #3 (O.S.)
           Look at that dude!
                         
          Jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the
          street, almost knocking over a postman. As Jack flies by
          Jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into Jamie's
          face. Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible.
                         
          Jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead,
          carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail.
                         
                          JACK
           Whoa.
                         
          Jamie's sled suddenly turns, narrowly missing the oncoming
          truck and barrels toward Jack's newly formed ice ramp...
                         
                          JAMIE
           AAAAHHHHHHHH!
                         
          Jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the
          street, high into the air, and toward the statue of Thaddeus
          Burgess, colonial settler - 1680. Jamie's friends stand in
          awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air.
                         
          Jamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to
          joy. Jack looks on smiling.
                         
          Jamie lands safely in a large mound of snow. Jack jumps onto
          the Statue of Thaddeus Burgess.

          Jamie's friends all come running to Jamie's aide, scared.
          But Jamie gets up.

           Jamie, are you alright? Is he
           okay?
                         
                          JAMIE
           Whoaaa! Did you guys see that? It
           was amazing! I slid - I did a jump
           and I slid under a car­-ERF!!
                         
          A sofa from the moving van suddenly knocks Jamie down...
                         
                          JACK
           Whoops.

          There's a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if Jamie
          is okay. Then, Jamie rises up from behind the sofa grinning,
          a new gap in his smile. He holds up a tooth.
                         
                          JAMIE
           Cool! A Tooth!

           fun we just had? That wasn't the

           she's going to leave?
                         
          As Jack looks down from the statue his frustration grows.
          Storm clouds overhead rumble and darken. Flurries of snow
          begin to intensify.

           Ah, it's hot cocoa time.
                         
          Jack jumps down from the statue, trying to engage the kids.
          But it's too late, the kids take off. Jack blocks Jamie's
          way as the boy comes running at him.
                         
                          JACK
           What's a guy gotta do to get a
           little attention around here!
                         
          WHOOOSH! Jamie runs through Jack, as if he where a ghost.
          Jack is left momentarily shaken, then...

          They're gone. Jack is alone again. His temper subsides.
                         
          He whips up a little wind and disappears.

          Jamie plays with a TOY ROBOT as DRAWINGS AND CHARTS of
          mystery creatures hang on the wall behind him: UFO's, aliens,
          Bigfoot, you name it. There's even a drawing of Jamie flying
          in midair on his sled.
                         
           JAMIE (O.S.)
           ...I did this jump and it was
           amazing and I slide under a car and
           it was awesome! Then I was flying
           down this hill and I was like
           whoosh, whoosh, whoosh through all
           these cars, and then the sled hit
           this, this thing, and I was like
           way up in the air.
                         
          He mimes flying in the air with his robot, then CRASHING to
          the bed as Sophie and their dog sit listening--
                         
                          JAMIE
           -- and then BAM! The sofa hit me,
           and, and see?

          We reveal JAMIE'S MOM in the room. Sophie LAUGHS and tries
          to stick a finger in the gap in his gums.
                         
                          JAMIE'S MOM
           Alright you, tooth under your
           pillow?
                         
          Jamie sets the TOY ROBOT on his nightstand, then grabs a
          stuffed rabbit next to his pillow to reveal a CAMERA AND
          FLASHLIGHT.
                         
                          JAMIE
           Yeah. I'm ready.
                         
                          JAMIE'S MOM
           Now don't stay up trying to see
           her, Jamie, or she won't come.
                         
                          JAMIE
           But I can do it this time! You
           wanna help me, Soph? We can hide
           and see the Tooth Fairy!

          Jamie's Mom picks Sophie up off the bed and lifts her over
          her shoulder. Their dog gets up and begins licking Jamie's
          face.
                         
                          JAMIE'S MOM
           Uh uh, straight to bed now, mister.

          ...We see Jack Frost, outside, hanging upsidedown watching
          them through the window. A pang. The glass frosts over.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROOF OF JAMIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jack flips onto the roof, a little pensive. He makes his way
          toward the roof's peak and looks up at the MOON, in full
          view. It lights up the night sky.
                         
                          JACK
           If there's something I'm doing
           wrong, can you, can you just tell
           me what it is?
                          (NO RESPONSE)
           Because I've tried everything, and
           no one ever sees me.
                          (NO RESPONSE)
           You put me here, the least you can
           do is tell me, tell me why.
                         
          A beat. The Moon shines silently down. Jack turns away in
          frustration.
                         
          Jack leaps off the roof, onto a telephone pole, and begins
          walking across some telephone wires. A stream of Dreamsand
          suddenly zips by behind him, then another, which swoops
          around in front of him. Jack turns and looks up, a smile now
          on his lips.
                         
                          JACK
           Right on time, Sandman.
                         
          The Dreamsand descends from the sky, and drifts into windows
          around the town. Jack runs along the telephone wire until he
          can reach out and intercept one of the passing streams. An
          adjacent stream takes the shape of a dolphin which turns
          toward Jack, before continuing on its way to a waiting child.
                         
          Then, we follow one of the streams into a window...

          INT. CUPCAKE'S BEDROOM - BURGESS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Dreamsand floats into a window, where CUPCAKE is in bed,
          hugging a stuffed unicorn in her sleep. The Dreamsand swirls
          over her head, and morphs into a little girl riding a
          unicorn. The girl smiles at the lovely dream as it flies
          around the room.
                         
          Then the room darkens as a wispy, shadowy figure with a
          familiar laugh crawls out from under the bed, and rises up.
          It's Pitch. He notices Cupcake's dream.
                         
                          PITCH
           Ohhhh, I thought I heard the
           clippity-clop of a unicorn. What
           an adorable dream!
                         
          His face softens, seemingly moved...
                         
                          PITCH
           (leans down to Cupcake)
           And look. At. Her. Precious
           child. So sweet, so full of hope
           and wonder. Why, there's only one
           thing missing...a touch of fear.
                         
          Pitch reaches into Cupcake's dream, and touches a bony finger
          to the unicorn. It turns ashen and black, and disintegrates.
          Cupcake flinches in her sleep. Pitch snickers, delighted.
                         
                          PITCH
           Hahaha! That never gets old!
                         
          Pitch swirls the Dreamsand around and it all turns into black
          corrupted Nightmare sand.
                         
                          PITCH
           Feel your fear. Come on. Come on,
           that's right.
                         
          The black sand morphs into a horrific, shadowy bucking horse -
          a NIGHTMARE.
                         
                          PITCH
           Yesss. What a pretty little
           Nightmare.
                         
          Gleefully, he grabs the Nightmare's mane --
                         
                          PITCH
           Now, I want you to go tell the
           others the wait is over.

          -- and sends it out the window, where it joins a posse of
          other Nightmares coursing through the streets. They take off
          and fly into the night sky.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURGESS - NIGHT
                         
          Pitch steps out into the street from an adjacent alley,
          avoiding the rays of moonlight. He looks up to the sky and
          stares at the MOON.
                         
                          PITCH
           Don't look at me like that, old
           friend. You must have known this
           day would come. My Nightmares are
           finally ready. Are your Guardians?
                         
                         
          EXT. BURGESS - NIGHT
                         
          Jack walks along a telephone wire as the Dreamsand disappears
          from the sky. Suddenly a shadowy figure and an unfamiliar
          noise zips by behind him.
                         
                          JACK
           Whoa!
                         
          In the background, residents get ready for the night.
                         
           RESIDENTS (O.S.)
                          (WALLA)
           Did you leave the windows open
           again? The garage door is wide
           open.
                         
          Jack leaps over a house to an adjacent tree to investigate
          and again, something zooms behind him. Jack jumps down from
          the tree and onto a truck in a nearby alley.

          trash can.
                         
          Jack jumps down from the truck and backs up out of the
          alleyway into a clearing...

          light steps...

          Jack is completely bewildered --
                         
                          JACK
           Bunny? You're not still mad about

           Yes.
                         
          Bunny whips out his boomerang and casually looks at it as he
          holds it in his hands.

          Before Jack realizes what's happening a HUGE HAND reaches
          into frame and lifts him off his feet.
                         
                          JACK

          Jack has been snatched up by two huge YETIS.
                         
                          JACK
           Put me down! What the...
                         
          Jack is shoved head first into a sack. A yeti whips out a
          snow globe, and smashes it on the ground.
                         
                          YETI

          A MAGIC PORTAL opens in front of them. The yetis make way
          for Bunny to leap in, but he demurs --

          He STAMPS HIS FOOT twice on the ground which SWIRLS OPEN -- a
          RABBIT HOLE magically appears. Bunny leaps into it and
          disappears along with the rabbit hole. In its place, from
          out of the ground grows a small green plant.

          The sack flies out of the portal and lands on the floor. In

           He's here.

           Wow, you gotta be kidding me.
                         
          Two Yetis suddenly grab Jack by the shoulders and lift him up
          onto his feet.

           Oh, they really do sparkle like
           freshly fallen snow.
                         
          Several swooning Mini Teeth flutter around a confused Jack,
          batting their lashes and screaming like crazed Beatles fans.
          Tooth collects herself, and...

           (sees Sandy is snoozing)
           Sandy! Sandy! Wake up!
                         
          Sandy bolts up awake and steps up to Jack, smiling.
                         
                          JACK
           Hey! Ho! Anyone wanna tell me why
           I'm here?
                         
          The WISP OF DREAMSAND above Sandy's head morphs into a
          BARRAGE OF IMAGES.
                         
                          JACK
           That's not really helping. But
           thanks, little man.
                          (TO OTHERS)
           I musta done something really bad
           to get you four together.
                         
          Jack walks away from the group, frosting an elf with a tray
          of cookies as it marches past, then turns around.
                         
                          JACK
           Am I on the naughty list?

          Off Jack's confusion, yetis light CEREMONIAL TORCHES with a
          WHOOSH. Elves leap from columns, unfurling homemade,
          celebratory BANNERS as they descend. Jack brushes off a few
          baby teeth who try to present him with a necklace made of
          paper snowflakes.
                         
                          JACK
           What are you doing! Get, get that
           offa me!
                         
          Jack's voice is drowned out by the sounds of horns and drums.
                         
                          NORTH
           This is the best part!
                         
          AN ELF MARCHING BAND strikes up, marching into the room. Two
          yetis move Jack on to a designated spot on the floor.
                         
          Jack looks down to find an elf pointing at his bare feet.
          The elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves,
          carrying a pair of ceremonial boots. Jack's confusion
          escalates.
                         
                          JACK
           Huh?
                         
          A Yeti hands North an old large book. North blows off the
          dust, opens it, and begins clearing his throat. Jack
          clenches his jaw as he scans the room: The Mini Teeth
          continue to fawn, Sandy's smiling, Bunny's apathetic, and
          North looks on with pride.
                         
          Jack suddenly SLAMS his staff down, sending a blast of FROST
          and WIND across the room. The torches go out and everything
          stops.
                         
                          JACK
           What makes you think I want to be a
           Guardian?
                         
          North bursts out in laughter holding the book in his hands
          then stops and looks to Jack, stone faced.
                         
                          NORTH
           Of course you do!

           Music!

          The music peters out again. An elf throws his trumpet to the
          ground and storms off. North, displeased, glowers.
                         
                          JACK
           Look, this is all very flattering,
           but ah...you don't want me. You're
           all hard work and deadlines, and
           I'm snowballs and fun times. I'm
           not a Guardian.

          Tooth swoops in and turns Jack's attention to the massive
          globe behind him.
                         
                          TOOTH

          North suddenly moves to Jack's side.

          the room.

                          JACK

          Jack looks over his shoulder; an angry yeti pounds his fist
          into his palm.

          North's factory is bustling with activity: Yeti's are
          building toys, moving packages, while Elves are test piloting
          the various flying toys.
                         
          As Jack walks behind North, surveying the factory, a duck toy
          suddenly flies over Jack's head. Jack ducks just in time and

                          NORTH
                          (WHISPERS)
           We just let them believe that.
                         
          Jack looks over to see a group of elves eating Christmas
          ornaments and another electrocuting himself with Christmas
          lights. North smiles and calls to them.
                         
                          NORTH
           Very nice! Keep up good work!
                         
          North continues through the factory floor. He passes a yeti
          putting the finishing touches on a blue toy robot.
                         
                          NORTH
                          (TO YETI)
           I don't like it. Paint it red.
                         
          The yeti reacts in dismay as we reveal hundreds of finished
          blue robots.
                         
                          NORTH
           Step it up, everybody.
                         
          As North and Jack move to the opposite end of the chamber, we
          finally glimpse the orchestrated chaos of the entire
          workshop, in all it's magic and splendor.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
                         
          Jack follows North into his office. There are shelves filled
          with toys. Sketches and prototypes everywhere.
                         
          North dusts his hands and turns to Jack. His sleeves are
          rolled. Jack notices that on one of North's forearms is
          tattooed the word NAUGHTY, and on the other, NICE. North
          grabs a plate from a nearby elf.
                         
                          NORTH
           Fruit cake?
                         
                          JACK
           Ah, no, thanks.
                         
          North hurls it - crash! A pause as North looks at Jack.

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Tacks of brass?
                         
          As North cracks his knuckles, Jack stands silent. The wind
          suddenly slams North's office door behind them. Jack looks
          to the door, it locks itself, and he turns back. North moves
          in close to Jack, backing him up against the door.
                         
                          NORTH
           Who are you, Jack Frost? What is
           your center?
                         
          North pokes Jack in the chest.
                         
                          JACK
           My center?

           very special inside.
                         
          North stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he
          gives Jack a curious look.
                         
                          NORTH
           Hmmmm?
                         
          North is standing in front of a shelf of Russian nesting
          dolls. One is carved to look like North himself.
                         
                          NORTH (CONT'D)
           Here. This is how you see me, no?
           Very big, intimidating. But if you
           get to know me a little--
           (hands the doll to Jack)
           Well, go on.
                         
          Jack gives North a curious look, then sets down his staff.
          He twists the doll in half, and inside is another carved
          North doll, this one is a more typical Santa Claus - red
          cheeked and cheery.
                         
                          JACK
           You are downright jolly.

          The dolls get progressively smaller as he twists them open,
          all versions of North, but all slightly different.

           I am also mysterious.

           And fearless.

           And caring. And at my center...
                         
          Twist. As North approaches, Jack looks down and drops the
          final Russian doll into the palm of North's hand. It's the
          size of a jelly bean.
                         
                          JACK
           There's a tiny wooden baby?
                         
                          NORTH
           Look closer. What do you see?
                         
          Jack holds it up to examine it.
                         
                          JACK
           You have big eyes?
                         
                          NORTH
           Yes! Big eyes. Very big. Because
           they are full! Of wonder! That is
           my center. It is what I was born
           with. Eyes that have always seen
           the wonder in everything!
                         
          North raises his hands, and the toys on the shelves suddenly
          spring to life. Jack-in-the-boxes pop, toy trains speed
          around the room, soldiers march about, toy planes fly
          overhead. An elf gets carried aloft by a balloon.
                         
          A flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its
          way around the room. A Christmas tree is ablaze with bright
          lights. Two double doors suddenly open as the flying car
          enters the factory floor.
                         
                          NORTH
           Eyes that see lights in the trees,
           and magic in the air!
                         
          As it crosses the frame, dozens of other toys are now flying
          around the massive chamber. It's a truly magical moment.
          North now stands outside his office, with Jack at his side.
                         
                          NORTH
           This wonder is what I put into the

           I don't know.
                         
          Jack looks down into his open palm, the wooden baby stares
          back at him. North closes Jack's hand. They exchange a look.
                         
          Then, something suddenly jets past a window outside. Almost
          simultaneously, Bunny and Sandman come running down the
          hallway toward North and Jack.

          prepare the hangar for launch.

          Suddenly: the SOUND of POUNDING HOOVES. BEASTLY SNORTING.
                         
          SANTA'S INCREDIBLE SLEIGH comes into view. It's a huge,

          Jack is understandably gob-smacked, so much so that he almost
          gets knocked over by one of the reindeer.

          The sleigh comes to a standstill as the Guardians prepare to
          climb inside. Several Yetis are still running around making
          last minute preparations.
                         
                          JACK
           Okay, one ride, but that's it.
                         
          Jack jumps aboard. North smiles knowingly, and climbs
          inside. Sandy hops up into the back seat.

          turns to see Bunnymund standing there, frozen and unnerved.

          Sandy, Bunny, and Jack fly back into their seats. Bunny
          clutches the edge of his, terrified. Jack can't help but
          laugh.

          North cracks the reigns, the sleigh plummets, an almost
          vertical drop. Sandy grins calmly. Jack loves this.

          Bunny turns to see Jack standing on the back edge of the
          sleigh.
                         
                          JACK
           Check out this view--
           EEEYAAAAGGHGHH!
                         
          Jack is SWEPT OFF the sleigh and disappears! Bunny gasps in
          horror and looks over the side...only to see Jack lounging on
          the sleigh's skid.
                         
                          JACK
           Awww...you do care.
                         
                          BUNNYMUND
           Ah, rack off you bloody show pony!
                         
          Bunny glowers as Jack makes his way back into the sleigh.

          North holds a snow globe up to his face.

           I say, Tooth Palace.
                         
          An image of the Tooth Palace appears inside the snowglobe.
          North throws the globe into the air and a giant vortex opens.

          A surreal light surrounds the sleigh as it hits HYPERDRIVE
          and gets sucked through the snow-globe portal with a WHOOSH.

          The sleigh suddenly comes out of HYPERDRIVE at the outskirts
          of the Tooth Palace. Streaks of black rapidly approaching.
                         
                          NORTH
           What!?
                         
          Suddenly our heroes find themselves in the midst of mayhem,
          as hundreds of Nightmares and terrified Tooth Fairies jet
          past. It's like a meteor storm. North yanks the reins, and
          the sleigh veers sharply, dodging the oncoming Nightmares.

           Whoa!
                         
          Jack now sees that the Nightmares are actually GULPING DOWN
          the fleeing fairies and flying off with them. It's chaos.
                         
                          JACK
           They're taking the tooth fairies!
                         
          Jack looks up to see a lone fairy with a Nightmare snapping
          at its heels. Jack leaps into the air and rescues it before
          the Nightmare can snatch it away.
                         
          Jack lands back in the sleigh. He opens his hand to reveal
          Baby Tooth, who's shaking with fear.
                         
                          JACK
           Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay?
                         
          As Baby Tooth nods, North steers the sleigh forward through
          the storm toward the entrance of Tooth's Palace.

          A vast chamber supported by pillars containing millions of
          tiny wooden deposit boxes from floor to ceiling. North spots
          a Nightmare up ahead and hands Jack the reigns.

          Jack, though surprised, quickly grabs the reigns and smiles
          as he snaps them.

           Hyah!
                         
          North readies his sword and SLICES the Nightmare in half --
                         
                          NORTH
           Yah!
                         
          SEVERAL TOOTH BOXES spill out of the split Nightmare and rain
          down into the sleigh at the Guardians' feet. The Nightmare
          disintegrates into black sand.
                         
                          BUNNYMUND

          Sandy looks at his hands and sees the Nightmare sand take
          shape and drift away. He and Bunny exchange a look.
                         
          The Guardians turn -- they're headed straight for a pillar.

           Aaaahhhh!

          stop on a platform. They see Tooth up above.

          Only then does it hit her. Tooth's wings drop in defeat.
          She's completely lost amidst the devastation. The Guardians
          rush to comfort her. Jack stays behind as Baby Tooth pops
          out from the hood of his tunic and flies over toward Tooth.

          Pitch's voice echoes across the open chamber. They look up to
          see Pitch, standing high above them with a satisfied smile.

          Bunny looks down past the edge of the platform to find Pitch

          Bunny goes after Pitch, but he disappears and reemerges on an
          opposite column. Tooth spots him, grabs one of Bunny's
          boomerangs and flies at Pitch in a rage...

          Pitch looks at Tooth with a smile and before she can reach
          him, a huge Nightmare darts out of hiding and rears up at
          her. Tooth falls back. Baby Tooth hides in Jack's tunic.

           came.

           PITCH (V.O.)

           a child...
                         
          PULL OUT from the last VIGNETTE, all the way out of TOOTH'S
          WIDE-OPEN EYE, and BACK TO SCENE. Jack, mystified, moves
          closer to Tooth as the palace continues to crumble.
                         
                          JACK
           What's going on?

           They, they don't believe in me
           anymore.

                          PITCH
           Didn't they tell you, Jack? It's
           great being a Guardian -- but
           there's a catch. If enough kids
           stop believing, everything your
           friends protect - wonder, hopes and
           dreams - it all goes away. And
           little by little, so do they.
                         
          Jack's realizes now the magnitude of Pitch's plan.
                         
                          PITCH
           No Christmas, or Easter, or little
           fairies that come in the night.
           There will be nothing. But fear
           and darkness and me! It's your
           turn not to be believed in!
                         
          Bunny throws his boomerangs at Pitch, who quickly ducks out
          of the way as they fly around the chamber columns. Pitch
          then jumps onto the back of Onyx down into the depths of the
          Palace. The Guardians dive after him, followed by Jack.
                         
          Bunny grabs a set of egg bombs and launches them at Pitch,
          exploding seconds before Pitch hits the ground.

          Tooth, deflated, sits on the ground with an empty tooth box
          in her hands. Baby Tooth, resting on a nearby broken tooth
          box, looks to Tooth with concern. Jack walks up and crouches
          down alongside Tooth.
                         
           BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
           Okay, alright I admit it, you were

           You should've seen them. They put

                          JACK
           Why would Pitch take the teeth?
                         
                          TOOTH
           It's not the teeth he wanted. It's
           the memories inside them.

           What do you mean?
                         
          Tooth leads Jack across the pond, the water freezing under
          his feet as he walks.
                         
                          TOOTH
           That's why we collect the teeth,
           Jack. They hold the most important
           memories of childhood.
                         
          Tooth directs him to a MURAL, which illustrates this.

          Jack takes a second to admire the immense beauty of the mural
          before him.

           that!
                         
          Jack, confused, is trying to process all this.
                         
                          JACK
           That night at the pond...I just,
           why I assumed...Are you saying, are
           you saying I had a life before
           that? With a home? And a family?

          Jack's expression says it all. Finally the key to all his
          questions.
                         
                          JACK
           All these years, and the answers
           were right here. If I find my
           memories, then I'll know why I'm
           here.
                          (TO TOOTH)
           You have to show me.
                         
          Jack, using his control of the wind, lifts up off the ground
          and flies across the pond.
                         
                          TOOTH
           I...I can't, Jack. Pitch has them.
                         
          Jack floats down onto a rock, overlooking the Guardians.

          Suddenly, a patch of Tooth's feathers fall out, and
          disappears. The Guardians eyes fill with worry.

          Jack looks to Tooth, who gives him a reassuring smile. Sandy
          gives to enthusiastic thumbs up while Bunny groans. Jack

          Tooth, overwhelmed, jets off without paying attention and

          THOOMP -- she smacks into a TOOTHPASTE BILLBOARD.

          Tooth jerks to attention: suddenly her VIEW ZOOMS IN thru a
          LITTLE GIRL'S BEDROOM WINDOW: a tiny GLOW under her pillow
          marks a freshly planted TOOTH.
                         
          Tooth gasps and her eyes go wide -- she FLIES to the window,
          excited. Jack reacts, looks to Baby Tooth: it's gonna be a
          long night.

          A strand of NIGHTMARE SAND from the Nightmare twirls in the

          But then Jamie's GREYHOUND rises up into frame, fully awake,
          its nostrils flaring at the scent he's picked up.

          Bunny is off like a shot, the greyhound right on his tail,
          running laps in the small room, the dog barking like crazy.

          As Tooth tries to silence the alarm clock, Jack can barely

          run circles around him--

           Sandy, Sandy!
                         
          The dog jumps past North, knocking him back.

           Ah!

          The Dreamsand goes flying.

           Hey, this is not proper Tooth Fairy
           behavior!
                         
          North ducks out of the way as the Dreamsand sails toward him.
          The Dreamsand baseball smacks Tooth right in the face and
          explodes into golden dust. Tooth and her fairy fall to the
          ground as a golden tooth takes shape above their heads.
                         
          Streams of Dreamsand make their way around the room.

           dingo off me!
                         
          Bunny gets a whiff of the golden sand. The image of a carrot
          quickly takes shape in front of his face.
                         
                          BUNNYMUND
           Oh no.
                         
          THUD! Bunny falls over asleep. THUD! So does the dog.
          North tries to scramble out of the way, but there's no escape
          in this tiny room.

          He teeters for a moment as Dreamsand candy canes appear
          before him, then falls like a giant Sequoia, landing - THUD! -
          on the end of Jamie's bed, which sends Jamie catapulting
          through the air.

          Luckily he lands -- OOF! -- in Sandy's arms. He starts to
          wake up AGAIN, but Sandy is there with a fistful of sand --
          BOOF! -- and Jamie too is out cold.

          Jack and Sandy look down at the sleeping boy, relieved. Then
          they look around -- a heap of sleeping, snoring bodies.
                         
                          JACK
           Whoops...
                         
          Bunny is snuggled up next to North. A carrot and candy
          canes, made of Dreamsand, hold hands as they dance above
          Bunny and North's head.
                         
          Jack comes down off the dresser and turns to Sandy, who has
          put Jamie back in bed. Sandy lifts North's arm and lets go,
          it's completely limp and falls flat. Sandy smiles at Jack,
          who chuckles.
                         
                          JACK
           Oh, I really wish I had a camera
           right now.
                         
          Sandy eyes suddenly widen. There's a Nightmare behind Jack.
          Jack turns to see A NIGHTMARE staring through the window.
          Without hesitation, Jack jumps out the window after it.

          Sandy pauses for a moment, then follows Jack's lead.

          The sleeping Guardians are where we left them. Jamie's
          bedroom door opens, and Sophie toddles in. She takes in the
          scene, amused. She toddles over to North, giggling.
                         
          She pokes at his rotund belly. Then she notices something.
          She reaches into his pocket and pulls out a snow globe.

          Suddenly the snow globe lights up. Sophie's eyes widen as
          she looks at the beautiful vista inside the globe. It's
          Bunny's warren.
                         
          She takes the globe and toddles off for the door, when she
          trips - again - and the snow globe smashes on the floor.

          BOOMF!! A flash of LIGHT. She looks up to see a magical
          portal open in front of her. A GUST WIND comes blowing out
          of the portal. Sophie giggles, and toddles through the
          portal.

          TWO NIGHTMARES zigzag along the rooftops, searching for
          victims. Jack, loving the chase, is in hot pursuit with
          Sandy, who's riding along on a streak of Dreamsand--
                         
                          JACK
           Wahooo!

           Haha! Yes!
                         
          One of the Nightmares splits off, angling for a BEDROOM
          WINDOW. Sandy calmly follows--
                         
          The Nightmare flies right through the WINDOW and SANDY does
          the same -- the OTHER ONE angles up over the house's ROOF to
          evade Jack, who PARKOURS over the roof after it--

           Waaahahoooo!
                         
          Through the WINDOWS BELOW, FLASHES OF GOLDEN and SICKLY GREEN
          LIGHT race through the house as Sandy battles the Nightmare--
                         
          The Nightmares and Jack ZOOM away from the house just as
          Sandy and the FIRST NIGHTMARE blast out of the window, Sandy
          wrestling it until -- POOF! It explodes into golden
          DREAMSAND which he quickly transforms into a Sting Ray for
          him to ride--

          Jack flies through town on the heels of the Nightmare. It
          makes a sharp turn down an alleyway and Jack is quick to
          follow.
                         
          The Nightmare then veers up the wall of the alley and onto a
          ROOFTOP. Jack whips a blast from his staff and HITS the
          Nightmare before it disappears from view.

           HAAAH! I got it!
                         
          Jack jumps up onto the roof and prods the frozen Nightmare
          with his staff.

           Look at this thing!
                         
          Jack can barely contain his excitement as he calls out to
          Sandy -- but suddenly Pitch lurches out from behind an air
          conditioning unit on the rooftop.
                         
                          PITCH
           Frost?
                         
          Jack blasts a WAVE OF FROST across the rooftop, but Pitch
          easily dodges it, reappearing behind Jack on the adjoining
          rooftop.
                         
                          PITCH
           You know, for a "neutral party" you
           spend an awful lot of time with
           those weirdos.
                          (BEAT)
           This isn't your fight, Jack.
                         
          Jack's eyes narrow. He holds out his staff, ready to strike.
                         
                          JACK
           You made it my fight when you stole
           those teeth.
                         
          Pitch regards him curiously.
                         
                          PITCH
           Teeth? Why do you care about the
           teeth?
                         
          When he notices something and turns to find Sandy calmly
          standing on the rooftop next to him. Pitch quickly
          sidesteps, moving away from Sandy.

                          PITCH
                          (CHUCKLING)
           Now this is who I'm looking for--
                         
          Before Pitch can finish a DREAMSAND STREAM whips around him,
          forcing him to duck and dodge Sandy's sudden attack.
                         
                          PITCH
           Whoa--??
                         
          Pitch DISPERSES a stream of NIGHTMARE SAND, turning it into a
          gigantic sickle and swings it back at Sandy. Jack ducks,
          avoiding injury as Sandy's pushed back against a ledge.
                         
          Sandy quickly grabs Pitch with another DREAMSAND STREAM and
          yanks him off his feet, slamming him repeatedly against the
          tops of the buildings until finally throwing him off the
          rooftop.
                         
          Pitch bounces off the ground as he crashes into an EMPTY
          STREET. As Sandy dusts his hands and calmly steps off the
          rooftop to follow, Jack looks on, astonished.
                         
                          JACK
           Remind me not to get on your bad
           side.

          Pitch shakes off the crash, trying to back up as Sandy
          touches down and moves toward him, Jack following. Pitch
          cowers on the ground in fear as they approach.
                         
                          PITCH
           (looks up, pleading)
           Okay, easy! You can't blame me for
           trying, Sandy. You don't know what
           it's like to be weak and hated. It
           was stupid of me to mess with your
           dreams. So I'll tell you what-
                         
          Sandy continues forward, grim faced...but suddenly Pitch
          stops cowering and stands up. His tone changes.
                         
                          PITCH (CONT'D)

          Before Jack and Sandy can react, a Nightmare shoots up
          through a storm drain as several other Nightmares gather in
          the alley behind him.

          Jack and Sandy look around as hundreds of Nightmares descend
          from the surrounding rooftops to encircle them. This doesn't
          look good. Jack, worried, looks to Sandy and mutters...
                         
                          JACK
           You take the ones on the left, I'll
           take the ones on the right?
                         
          Meanwhile, Pitch rises up from off the ground as Onyx takes
          shape underneath him.
                         
          Pitch grabs onto Onyx's mane as it snorts and snarls. He
          then leans forward.
                         
                          PITCH
           Boo!
                         
          Pitch's army of Nightmares begin to charge. Then suddenly,
          the sound of BELLS and REINDEER echo in the distance--
                         
          NORTH'S SLEIGH bursts through the clouds. Jack and Pitch
          look up into the sky as it circles overhead. The sleigh
          turns toward Pitch, only to fly a few feet over his head.
          Pitch turns as it passes over him, slightly confused.

          North's asleep at the wheel, along with Bunny and Tooth.
          Suddenly, the sleigh clips one of its skis as it flies over
          City Hall, jolting North to attention.

          Still battling Nightmares, Sandy propels himself and Jack
          into the air with a stream of Dreamsand and launches Jack
          away from the Nightmares. Jack quickly orients himself and
          knocks an oncoming Nightmare with his staff.
                         
          Tooth quickly jumps off the side of the sleigh toward Jack
          and Sandy.

          Jack, knocks away a few more Nightmares with his staff, and

          of Nightmares, slicing them apart with her wings, causing
          them to EXPLODE into BLACK SAND.

          Back in the sleigh, Bunny jumps out and lands on a nearby
          roof.
                         
          Bunny quickly tosses his boomerang which disintegrates every
          Nightmare in its path. Bunny catches the returning
          boomerang, leaps off the roof, and grabs the skids of the
          sleigh as it passes by.

           Ha. Ha. Ha. Come on!
                         
          Jack heads back to the sleigh by dodging two Nightmares as
          they attack. As he continues his descent, Jack is suddenly
          blind sided by another Nightmare, which knocks the staff from
          his hands.
                         
          For a moment, Jack is in a state of panic as he finds himself
          in free fall.

          He finally manages to hook onto the staff, control his
          descent, and land on the sleigh as it flies past.

          A gust of wind blows past Pitch, quickly followed by a

          of Nightmare sand toward him, culminating in an explosion of
          ice and snow.

          The sleigh zooms into it and it WINKS OUT.
                         
          Pitch shakes the FROST from his arms as scores of Nightmares

          scuttling out from the tunnel.

          Bunny hops into view, Sophie clinging to his back smiling,
          leading a huge mass of eggs down a wide PATH. As he passes,
          FLOWERS BLOOM on either side in his wake, BLASTING the
          passing eggs with color as they go.

           Alright troops, it's time to push

          Sophie, on her back, is carried by the eggs through the
          sorting stones. She giggles as North waves at her while she
          passes by.

          Baby Tooth flies across the screen, diverting our attention
          to a multicolored stream off in the distance.

          Baby Tooth joins an elf, who stands alongside an egg at the
          edge of a cliff. The elf pushes the egg over the cliff, into
          the stream, and celebrates with a victory dance.
                         
           BUNNYMUND (V.O.)
           Oh, there will be bathtubs filled
           with my beautiful googies!
                         
          The elf turns just in time to see a stampede of colored eggs
          come barreling toward him. They knock him off the cliff as
          he and the eggs spill into the multi-colored stream below.

          COLORS and intricate PATTERNS of all kinds.
                         
          An unlucky egg veers off and gets stuck in a WHIRLPOOL. We
          see a hand fish it out to reveal North, who looks at the egg
          curiously. It's now got a SPIRAL PATTERN on it and its
          little LEGS kick madly.
                         
                          NORTH

          As a technicolored elf climbs out of the stream, North sets
          the egg down and lets it rejoin the herd.

          As Sophie leads a parade of eggs, Bunny jumps to an adjacent
          rock and sits up to address the eggs as they walk in stride.
          Meanwhile, Jack rides atop a group of sentinel egg that are
          marching in the back ground.

          CLOSE ON: a line of eggs running down curled vines as yetis
          sprinkle them with glitter. They continue on down various
          vine corkscrew-like shoots, decorating the eggs with stripes.
                         
          A confused elf emerges from the vines, striped with paint and
          walks off.

           Oh, what's over there?
                         
          Sophie appears, spots the egg, and delicately lifts it out of
          the grass. She holds it close to admire the intricate detail
          of its shell. Sophie brings the egg to Bunny for him to
          inspect.

          Jack approaches from behind and makes his way alongside
          Bunny, who holds Sophie in his arms. Its our first real
          vista of the whole warren. It's a spectacular sight.
                         
                          JACK
           Not bad.
                         
          Sophie yawns and begins to fall asleep. Bunny turns to Jack
          with a smile.

          North comes up from behind with Tooth at his side. They turn
          toward Bunny, marveling at the sight of Sophie, fast sleep.
          It's touching. Bunny's face softens, as if remembering a
          distant memory.
                         
                          BUNNYMUND

          won't let go of his neck. Finally, she releases her grasp
          only to roll over and fall out of bed. Baby Tooth gives Jack
          a scornful look.

          stuffed animal.

          looks out across the town, toward the woods, and the sound of
          the echoed voice.

          Jack takes a moment to orient himself and lands, settling on
          a rotating vent; as the momentum slowly spins him around, the

          a clearing only to find the decrepit remains of a rotting
          frame from a child's bed. Very creepy. What would that be
          doing in the woods, and how long has it been here?

          Jack takes his staff, and breaks through the damaged frame,

          Jack jumps up onto one of the cages, then quickly leaps and

           VOICE FROM A MEMORY
           Jack...
                         
                          JACK
           (under his breath)
           As I can --
                         
          Jack looks down and sees the tooth drawers from Tooth's
          Palace. Mounds of them heaped to the ceiling. And inside
          the drawers are the missing baby teeth. He drops down to a
          mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at
          the names on the boxes.
                         
          In an instant he forgets his duties, and the fairies, and the
          Guardians and everything except those teeth, and the chance
          to finally get his memory back.
                         
          The cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was. Jack
          finally looks up, as a shadow of Pitch crawls up a nearby
          column.
                         
           PITCH (O.S.)
           Looking for something?
                         
          Jack swings around with his staff, shooting off a blast of
          ice, but Pitch isn't there. Jack takes off, following the
          sound of Pitch's cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber.
                         
          Jack rounds a corner as he sees Pitch's shadow glide across
          the walls into a shadowed corridor.
                         
           PITCH (O.S.)
           Don't be afraid, Jack. I'm not
           going to hurt you.
                         
          Jack continues along a shadowed corridor.
                         
                          JACK
           Afraid?
                         
          Jack sees Pitch on a bridge across the cavern and heads after
          him.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           I'm not afraid of you!
                         
                          PITCH
           Maybe not. But you are afraid of
           something.
                         
          Jack steadily approaches, cautious and alert.
                         
                          JACK

                          PITCH
           I know so. It's the one thing I
           always know.
                         
          Pitch finally turns to face Jack.
                         
                          PITCH (CONT'D)
           People's greatest fears. Yours is
           that no one will ever believe in
           you.
                         
          Panic flashes in Jack's eyes. As he backs away, the chamber
          fills with shadows, and Jack is spun around. He's
          disoriented as he thuds into a wall, which flips to reveal
          that it's actually the ground.
                         
          Pitch, unseen now, chuckles.
                         
          Jack's unsure of where he is. He looks back to see the
          cavern entrance -- he's right back where he started.
                         
           PITCH (O.S.)
           And worst of all, you're afraid
           you'll never know why. Why you?
           Why were you chosen...to be like
           this?
                         
          Jack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks
          as Pitch's shadow encroaches on him.
                         
                          PITCH
           Well fear not, for the answer to
           that...
                         
          Pitch is now directly in front of Jack, holding out a tooth
          box.
                         
                          PITCH (CONT'D)
           Is right here.
                         
          Jack's eyes widen at the sight - the face of a young boy
          etched into the box, and under it is the name "Jack Frost."
                         
                          PITCH
           Do you want them, Jack? Your
           memories?
                         
          He holds them out to Jack. Jack stares, fighting the impulse
          to grab them. He closes his eyes, struggling to make a
          decision, but when he opens them again, Pitch has
          disappeared.
                         
          Pitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern.

          Jack heads down a corridor, cast shadows from the Mini Tooth
          cages everywhere.
                         
           PITCH (O.S.)
           Everything you wanted to know...
                         
          Pitch's face moves in and out of the shadows over the
          following.
                         
                          PITCH
           ...in this little box.
                         
          Every time Jack turns, Pitch disappears. It's like Jack's
          trapped in a fun house.
                         
          Multiple Pitch shadows have appeared on the wall around Jack.
          They're closing in on him.
                         
                          PITCH
           Why did you end up like this?
           Unseen. Unable to reach out to
           anyone.
                          (BEAT)
           You want the answers so badly. You
           want to grab them, and fly off with
           them. But you're afraid of what
           the Guardians will think.
                         
          Jack's breath quickens. He's been pushed into a corner.
                         
                          PITCH
           You're afraid of disappointing
           them.
                          (SMILES)
           Well let me ease your mind about
           one thing. They'll never accept
           you. Not really.
                         
          The shadows have overcome Jack.
                         
                          JACK
           (trying to scramble away)
           Stop it! Stop it!
                         
          Almost reluctantly, the shadows back away and Pitch appears
          before Jack.
                         
                          PITCH
           After all, you're not one of them.

           Why, you're doing it right now.
                         
          Pitch tosses the box to Jack, who instinctively catches it.
          Jack looks up. Terror comes into Jack's eyes, as he
          realizes...
                         
                          JACK
           What did you do?
                         
                          PITCH
           More to the point Jack, what did
           you do?
                         
          Pitch begins to back away, becoming one with the darkness,
          laughing as he disappears. Jack charges towards him only to
          be swallowed whole by one of Pitch's black holes.

          Jack realizes he's forgotten something.

          He turns to re-enter the hole in the wall only to find
          himself face to face with one of Bunny's stone emblems.

           Happy Easter, Jack.
                         
          Jack turns around. Suddenly, his eyes fill with dread as he
          realizes where he is. Thousands of broken egg shells lay
          strewn about, forming a path toward the light at the end of
          the tunnel.
                         
                          JACK

          Bunny checks the eggs in his basket, then looks back toward
          the kids.

          Bunny, egg basket in hand, approaches a group of kids who
          seem to be wandering around searching halfheartedly,

          JACK's watching this all unfold and it's heartbreaking,
          because he knows it's his fault. Tooth flies to Bunny's

           That is why you weren't here?
                         
          North steps forward to confront Jack.
                         
                          NORTH (CONT'D)
           You were with Pitch?

           No, listen, listen...I'm sorry. I
           didn't mean for this to happen.

          sign that reads, `Easter Egg Hunt.'
                         
          This is like a punch in Jack's gut. He looks back to Tooth
          and North, both of whom look away, too hurt by Jack. He
          looks at them with a pained expression. This is exactly what
          Pitch said would happen.
                         
          Jack reaches into his pocket, pulls out the tiny Russian
          nesting doll that North had given him, drops the doll to the
          ground, and takes off.
                         
          As Jack leaves, carried off by the wind, we see the tiny
          Russian nesting doll laying on the ground.

          Jamie, atop a ladder, strains for what looks like an Easter
          egg, hiding in the rain gutter. The ladder totters and Jamie
          loses his balance, beginning to fall.
                         
                          JAMIE

          crashing down into a mound of snow.
                         
          As Jamie gets up off the ground, he sees that the Easter egg
          was in fact a dirty old tennis ball. Jamie stands up,
          bewildered, and dusts himself off as his friends LAUGH. A
          few have empty EASTER BASKETS.

          Pippa walks away, trailing the others. Jamie doesn't know

          Jack whips around and shoots a burst of frost at Pitch, but
          it's quickly deflected by the Nightmare sand.

           You don't understand anything!
                         
          Jack continues to attack, lashing out with his staff. Pitch
          blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the
          Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength.

          Pitch strikes back, putting Jack on the defense. Jack jumps
          in the air. Their show of force escalates until they're
          shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind. As the wind
          and snow settle, Jack looks around stern and alert.

          compassion on Jack's face as he listens.

           believe in both of us.

           No, they'll fear both of us. And
           that's not what I want.
                         
          Jack turns and walks away.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Now for the last time, leave me
           alone.
                         
          Pitch looks confused and hurt. This is not the response he
          was expecting. Then...his eyes flame with anger. He made
          himself vulnerable, and Jack rejected him. No more
          negotiating now.

          Baby Tooth struggles to get loose, but Pitch only tightens
          his grip. She can hardly breathe. Jack has no choice.
          Jack...hands over...the staff.
                         
          Pitch twirls the staff.
                         
                          JACK
           (re: Baby Tooth)

           So be alone!
                         
          Baby Tooth squirms until she's finally able to peck Pitch in
          the hand with her beak. Pitch shrieks and throws Baby Tooth
          in the air and down into the mouth of a crevasse.

           No!
                         
          Jack, enraged, can't believe what he's seeing. Pitch lifts
          the staff, and breaks it over his knee, cracking it in two.
          Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's
          eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain.
                         
          Suddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting
          Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him. As
          the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the
          chasm below.
                         
          Pitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling. He throws
          the broken shards of Jack's staff down into the crevasse and
          casually walks away, disappearing on the horizon.

          Baby Tooth nods, but she's hurt, and cold. Jack does his
          best to shield her from the cold.
                         
                          JACK
           Sorry, all I can do is keep you
           cold.
                         
          Jack sits up and holds Baby Tooth in his hands.
                         
                          JACK
           Pitch was right - I make a mess of
           everything.
                         
          Jack is devastated. Baby Tooth's never seen him like this;
          it's heart breaking...then she gets a thought. Her
          expression hardens with determination.
                         
          She wriggles deep into his pocket.
                         
                          JACK
           Hey?
                         
          Jack leans back and begins to close his eyes when he hears
                         SOMETHING --
                         
           VOICE FROM A MEMORY
           Jack... Jack...
                         
           -- and then he FEELS something. Looks down: There's a SOFT,
          GOLDEN GLOW coming from his pocket.
                         
          Jack jumps, taken aback. He reaches in and pulls out the
          TOOTH BOX -- it's pulsing with light.
                         
           VOICE FROM A MEMORY
           Jack...

          Baby Tooth gives him a reassuring look.
                         
          Baby Tooth motions to the box, then looks back at Jack. Jack
          reaches to touch the box, but as he does its top magically
          UNFOLDS to reveal a handful of BABY TEETH - then the box and
          everything else glows BRIGHT WITH INTENSE LIGHT -

          Jack walks toward the woods with his sister. His mother,
          face unseen, calls out to him.
                         
                          JACK'S MOTHER
           Be careful.
                         
          Jack shakes his head like he's heard it a million times but
          never pays it any mind.
                         
                          JACK

          pulling back to reveal him dressed as we first saw him in
          16th century clothes. Behind him, dark winter trees and snow

                          JACK
           (calm, serious)
           It's okay. It's okay. Don't look
           down, just look at me.
                         
          Jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two
          rudimentary ice-skates, leaving him BAREFOOT on the surface
          of a familiar FROZEN pond. And now we see what he sees, a
          girl of about FOUR (with an uncanny resemblance to Jamie's
          sister Sophie) stands in her skates, rooted to the spot. A
          spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands.
                         
                          JACK'S SISTER
           Jack, I'm scared.
                         
          CRACCKKK! The ice below her splinters more. She wobbles as
          it starts to separate.
                         
                          JACK
           I know, I know...but you're gonna
           be alright. You're not gonna fall
           in. We're gonna have a little fun
           instead.
                         
                          JACK'S SISTER
           No we're not!
                         
                          JACK
           Would I trick you?
                         
                          JACK'S SISTER
           (fighting back tears)
           Yes! You always play tricks!
                         
                          JACK
                          (CHUCKLES)
           Well, alright. Well, not, not this
           time. I promise. I promise,
           you're gonna be...you're gonna be
           fine.
                         
          Jack fixes her gaze...holds it...there's nothing but the two
          of them.
                         
                          JACK
           You have to believe in me.
                         
          Jack's sister pauses a moment, then smiles through her fear.
                         
          And just like that, Jack's demeanor changes. A light is
          switched on inside him and the last thing that could be
          happening is what is actually happening.

           You wanna play a game? We're going
           to play Hopscotch! Like we play
           every day!
                         
          Jack's sister looks more reassured.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           It's as easy as...one...whoaaaa...
                         
          And Jack shows his sister the first leap, but mugs for her,
          almost losing his balance then catching himself. She laughs.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Two...
           (the next jump)
           Three!
                         
          He turns toward her with his arms spread out.
                         
                          JACK
           Alright...
                         
          He reaches down to pick up a familiar-looking stick lying on
          the ice. He extends it towards her --
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Now it's your turn.
                         
          Jack's sister looks down. She is trying to gather her
          courage. Jack, never breaking his gaze with her,
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
                          (SOFTLY)
           One...
                         
          She hops, wobbling, but catching her balance.
                         
                          JACK
           That's it, that's it...two...
                         
          She's almost there, Jack's staff just beyond her reach.
                         
                          JACK
           Three.
                         
          She grabs hold of Jack's staff and in one massive effort he
          slings her with all his might to safety. But the movement
          propels him into the cracked ice. He looks up to see his
          sister safe - smiles - and then plunges into the dark cold
          water.

                          JACK'S SISTER
           Jack!
                         
          Jack falls back into the icy water. SPLASH!
                         
                         
                         UNDERWATER
                         
          We're looking up at the hole in the ice, descending into the
          dark icy depths...then THE FULL MOON appears from behind the
          clouds as Jack's hands claw through the water towards it, but
          it's helpless. The MOON glows bright...brighter...
                         
          Jack's BODY begins to glow, bathed in MOONLIGHT. PUSH IN on
          his FACE, becoming brighter and brighter until his brown hair
          turns white and JACK'S BRIGHT BLUE EYES flash open --
                         
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN FISSURE - NIGHT
                         
          The icy walls rush back in as we pull out from Jack, reeling
          from the memory. He sees Baby Tooth.
                         
                          JACK
           Did you -- did you see that?
                         
          She shakes her head `no', tweets `of course not'!
                         
                          JACK
           It -- it was me! I had a family!
           I had a sister!
                         
          His excitement suddenly turns to realization.
                         
                          JACK
           I saved her!
                         
          He looks up at the opening above. The MOON peeks out from
          behind the clouds.
                         
                          JACK
           (whispers up to Manny)
           That's why you chose me.
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           I'm, I'm a Guardian.
                         
          The Moon seems to shine a little BRIGHTER. Baby Tooth tries
          to take flight but she sputters and lands back in the palm of
          Jack's hand.

           We have to get out of here.
                         
          Jack looks down at the two halves of his staff, and picks
          them up. He tries to fit them back together, but nothing
          happens. He tries again, this time using every ounce of
          strength left in him. Baby Tooth watches, her eyes widening
          as, a SPARK of blue light shoots off the staff.
                         
          Jack continues to push, until a the icy blue light spreads
          and melds the two ends of the staff back together. Jack
          smiles.

          Suddenly Jack, with Baby Tooth tucked safely in his tunic,
          SHOOTS UP out of the fissure, high into the sky and through
          the clouds.
                         
                          JACK

          Jack looks around and notices that all of the Minis are still
          in their cages.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)

          The fairies are just standing around, listless.

          A Yeti very carefully sets the last of a group of newly
          painted red robot dolls on a shelf. He breathes a sigh of
          relief.
                         
          Suddenly, the entire factory begins to shake, knocking the
          robot doll to the ground. He dives after it, juggles it in
          the air, and catches it just before it hits the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, streaks of BLACK SAND whoosh up into and around the
          factory. The dark sand snakes its way up and around the
          globe, causing the Yetis and Elves to scatter and knocking
          TOYS to the floor.
                         
          The Yetis and Elves look up in horror as the black sand, now
          covering the globe, gives rise to Pitch, who stands before
          them cackling.
                         
                          PITCH

          The yeti with the robot dolls sinks his head and sighs in
          defeat.

          Jack lands on the ground, now standing before PITCH'S GLOBE --
          and it looks almost completely devoid of light.
                         
                          JACK
           They're all going out...
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH POLE - DAY
                         
          Pitch is practically dancing across North's globe, he's so
          giddy, counting down as the last few lights go dark.
                         
                          PITCH
           Only six left! Six precious
           children who still believe in the

          His eyes widen as he snaps his fingers with anticipation and
          glee. All of his hard work and planning - finally paying
          off!
                         
          Pitch stares down at the one last light, waiting for it to go
          out. He snaps his fingers a few more times. Still nothing.
          His smile fades. His face goes cold as he realizes...
                         
                          PITCH

          Jack jumps up onto the globe to closely inspect the last
          light. The light is brought into full view. Jack smiles.
                         
                          JACK
           Jamie!
                         
          We're tight on the globe, where the LAST LIGHT flickers. We
          PUSH IN to the light and...

          until we land on Jamie's house, a single light shining from
          his bedroom window.

          INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jamie is sitting up in bed, talking to an old stuffed rabbit,
          and whispering.
                         
                          JAMIE
           Okay look, you and I are obviously
           at what they call a crossroads, so
           here's what's gonna happen -
                         
          Jack appears outside Jamie's window and moves closer to get a
          better look.
                         
                          JAMIE (CONT'D)
           If it wasn't a dream and if you are
           real, then you have to prove it.
           Like right now.

          Jamie waits. He looks around expectantly. Jack looks on
          from outside the window, wondering if anything will happen.
                         
                          JAMIE
           (desperation creeping in)
           I've believed in you for a long
           time, okay? Like my whole life in
           fact. So you kinda owe me now.
                         
          Jamie picks up his stuffed rabbit and holds it close.
                         
                          JAMIE (CONT'D)
           You don't have to do much, just a
           little sign so I know. Anything.
                          (BEAT)
           Anything at all.
                         
          He waits. It's excruciating.
                         
                          JAMIE
                          (A WHISPER)
           I knew it.
                         
          Jamie lets the stuffed animal fall to the floor. Jack comes
          into the room and watches as the light slowly fades from
          Jamie's eyes, disbelief setting in.
                         
          Jack doesn't know what to do. He takes a moment to
          concentrate, then enters the room.
                         
          Then, Jamie notices the window as the panes of glass freeze
          over. The image of an Easter egg suddenly appears...
                         
                          JAMIE
           (seeing the window)
           Huh?
                         
          Jamie looks down at the stuffed rabbit on the floor. He can
          barely comprehend what he's seeing. Jamie looks back to the
          window as more of the window panes frost over. Jamie's eyes
          get huge with amazement.
                         
                          JAMIE
           He's real.
                         
          Jack, excited, continues to exert himself trying to bring
          life to his drawing. And when he does, the frost rabbit
          comes leaping off of the window.
                         
                          JAMIE
           Whoa...
                         
          The rabbit hops around Jamie's room, bursting like a snowball
          over Jamie's head, the snowflakes sprinkling down on him.

           Whoa!
                         
          Jack is as amazed as Jamie. But Jamie's amazement turns to
          confusion.
                         
                          JAMIE
           Snow?
                         
          A snowflake lands on the tip of Jamie's nose. The snowflake
          glows a magic blue. And in that moment a light comes into
          Jamie's eyes - an idea starts to take hold.
                         
                          JAMIE

                          JACK
           (a stunned beat)
           Did he just say--?
                         
          Jamie stands up on his bed.

           He said it again. He said --
                          (BEAT)
           You said...
                         
          Jamie turns around and suddenly his eyes go wide...
                         
                          JAMIE

           That's right! But-but that's me!
           Jack Frost! That's my name! You
           said my name!
                         
          Jamie's mouth drops open. Only then does Jack realize...
                         
                          JACK
           Wait, can you hear me?

           Can you... Can you see me?

           He sees me. He sees me!
                         
          Jack leaps for joy, and the room suddenly explodes with snow.
          Jamie can't believe it.

           all the blizzards and snow days,
           and you remember when you went

          Suddenly, the sound of thunder and North's sleigh as Jack and

           Whoa, whoa, whoa...
                         
          NORTH AND TOOTH arrive on the sleigh completely out of
          control, and crash land outside Jamie's house.
                         
          The reindeer are separated from the sleigh and run into the
          woods. A disheveled Tooth and North emerge from the
          wreckage.

           Ah, moi deti! Come back!

                          TOOTH
           North! Are you okay?

                          TOOTH

           Jack--!
                         
          Tooth falters and falls to the ground.

           Same as you.
                         
          Jack looks off to the side as Jamie appears from out of his
          backyard.
                         
                          NORTH

           Wow! It is you! I mean it is you!

           Jack! He sees you!
                         
          Jack puts a protective hand on Jamie's shoulder. Jamie looks
          up at him and smiles. Jack and North exchange a look.
                         
                          JACK
           Wait, but, where's Bunny?

           Losing Easter took its toll on all
           of us. Bunny most of all.
                         
          Jack's face goes pale. North lowers his head in sadness.
          Then a twitchy-nosed LITTLE BUNNY appears on the sleigh.
                         
                          JACK
           Oh...no...
                         
                          JAMIE
                          (CHUCKLES)
           That's the Easter Bunny?
                         
                          BUNNYMUND
           Now somebody sees me! I mean,
           where were you about an hour ago,
           mate?
                         
                          JAMIE
           What happened to him? He used to be
           huge and cool! And now he's cute.
                         
          Jamie gently tickles Bunny under his chin. Bunny begins
          involuntarily thumping his paw.
                         
                          BUNNYMUND

          Bunny catches himself and pushes Jamie's hands away.
                         
                          BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
                          (TO JACK)
           Did you tell him to say that?
           (hops over to Jack)
           That's it! Let's go! Me and you!
           Come on!
                         
                          JAMIE
           No! Actually he told me you were
           real. Just when I started to think
           that maybe you weren't.
                         
          Bunny stops. Did he just hear that right?
                         
                          BUNNYMUND
           He made you believe? In me?
                         
          A moment of reconciliation between them, broken by the sounds
          of THUNDER. The Guardians look to the sky to see Pitch
          enveloped by dark clouds as he stares down at them from atop
          a writhing mass of Nightmare sand.

           Be careful, Jack!
                         
          Jack leaps into the air, and goes flying directly at Pitch.
          Meanwhile, the Guardians take Jamie to find shelter.

           we?
                         
          Pitch sighs as he rolls his eyes and flies down to meet Jack
          head on.

          Jack sends a blast of ice and frost at Pitch as he barrels
          toward him. Pitch easily absorbs the attack with his
          Nightmare sand.

           me anymore.
                         
          Jack's plan backfires as Pitch charges ahead and unleashes a
          roaring fury of Nightmare sand that knocks Jack out of the
          sky.

          Jamie and the Guardians do their best to avoid the patrolling
          Nightmares. North struggles to keep up.
                         
                          BUNNYMUND

          Bunny leads them down an alley, but it's no use.

           Dead end. Other way other way!
                         
          Jack suddenly falls from the sky, lands on a dumpster, and
          falls limp to the ground. THUD! The others turn their
          attention and wince.

          North and Tooth trade looks of concern. Then, a menacing
          chuckle. The Guardians keep a watchful eye as Nightmare
          shadow streaks across the alley.
                         
           PITCH (V.O.)
           All this fuss over one little boy.
           And still he refuses to stop
           believing.
                         
          A CRACK of Thunder reveals the shadow of an approaching
          Nightmare as the sounds of hooves clacking against the ground
          echoes from the opposite end of the alley.

           Very well. There are other ways to
           snuff out a light.
                         
          Bulbs start bursting as the arm of a shadow moves across the
          remaining lights in the alley. Terror in Jamie's eyes. What
          does that mean?

          With a finger raised, the shadow arm glides along the floor,
          curling around the back of Bunny.
                         
                          PITCH

           Look how fluffy you are! Would you
           like a scratch behind the ears?
                         
          Bunny jumps back into North's arms.

          Pitch comes into view, riding atop Onyx. A gleeful smile
          strewn across his face.
                         
                          PITCH
           I can't tell you how happy it makes
           me to see you all like this. You
           look awful.
                         
          They are weak and defenseless. But still the Guardians
          gather around Jamie, to shield him from whatever may come.

          There's a sudden moment of realization. Jack has heard these
          words before.

          Jamie gives Jack a questioning look. What does Jack have in
          mind? Pitch gets closer.
                         
                          PITCH

          BOOF! A snowball suddenly hits Pitch in the face. Two
          Nightmares look at each, unsure how to react. Jamie can't
          help but snicker and North lets out a chuckle.
                         
          Jack looks around the alley. He spots a wooden crate, a
          trash can lid and a discarded wok amidst a pile of trash.
                         
                          JACK

          Pitch wipes the snow from his face and looks up to see a
          track of ice leading out of the alleyway. Jack, Jamie and
          the Guardians are gone.

          city is quiet. Suddenly a streak of blue begins to
          materialize, making its way through the tranquil suburb.
                         
          A man walks his dog across an empty street when suddenly a
          cold wind blows behind him. Jack and Jamie come flying past,
          leaving a trail of ice in their wake. And on that ice - the

          Cupcake pulls the covers down to find that it's suddenly

          Jack, the Guardians, and the children all come to gliding
          halt on their sleds. They look up to see Pitch standing atop
          a building with a confident smile, while the clouds stir
          behind him.
                         
          Monty, late to the party, comes running joyously past Jamie
          and the Guardians who stand in silence as they stare up at
          the sky.

           You think a few children can help
           you? Against this!
                         
          The Nightmare sand storm descends from the sky. North draws
          his sword, but the weight of the blade pulls him down. He
          can barely stand. Jack moves to North's side as they look
          back to Jamie, noticing the concern on his face.
                         
                          JACK
           They're just bad dreams, Jamie.

          Jamie takes a moment to reflect while his friends look up at
          the sky in fear. Jack looks down, surprised, to see that
          Jamie has taken a position in FRONT of him.

           as the boogeyman?
                         
          Pitch's wave of Nightmare sand snakes its way through town
          causing destruction wherever it goes and converges toward a
          single point as it heads straight toward the kids.

          Jamie thrusts out his hand toward the Nightmare wave. His
          friends follow suite, just as the Nightmare sand smashes into
          them. As it makes contact, the black sand...bursts into
          streams of GOLDEN DREAMSAND.

          Everyone is amazed, hardly believing their eyes. Streams of
          Dreamsand swirl around the children. And then it's
          pandemonium. The Nightmares buck and jump as the sand makes
          its way past them.

          boomerangs which slice through two more Nightmares, turning
          them to dust.
                         
          Bunny drums his feet on the ground and an army of sentinel
          eggs suddenly rise up out of the earth. Caleb finds himself

          as they fly through them.
                         
          The kids look to see a Nightmare charging toward them, only

           I know what we have to do! Guys,
           come on!
                         
          Jamie leads his friends as they follow the streams of
          Dreamsand down the street toward the growing mass of golden
          sand.

                          JACK
           It's over Pitch! There's no place
           to hide.
                         
          Pitch give them a wry smile and quickly descends into the
          shadows, casting multiple versions of himself along the alley
          walls.
                         
          Suddenly, in their moment of distraction, Pitch rises up
          behind Jack, his Nightmare sand AXE in hand.
                         
                          BUNNYMUND
           Jack, look out!
                         
          The other Guardians look on in horror as--
                         
          A golden whip wraps itself round Pitch's hands. We follow
          the whip to reveal Sandy, coalescing from the funnel cloud of
          Dreamsand. He gives Pitch a look, wags his finger, and then
          uppercuts him into the air.

          Sandy looks off to the side to where Jamie and his friends
          have gathered. He forms a Dreamsand hat and tips the cap to
          Jamie. Jamie, gleeful, waves back to Sandy as his friends
          stand behind him in awe.

           alright! Wahoo! Wow!
                         
          Sandy then looks to his whip and tugs on it, slamming Pitch
          into the ground and knocking him out. The Guardians cheer as
          they welcome Sandy's return.

          A wisp of Dreamsand floats into a child's bedroom and touches
          his forehead while he sleeps. Suddenly, a Dreamsand figure
          forms above the child's head, it's the Tooth Fairy.

          Other fairies begin to fly. They shoot down to the tooth
          boxes and begin opening them. We see one of the faces on a
          box, and transition to the actual child who she goes from sad
          to happy as her fondest memories flood back. We zoom out of
          her face to see thousands of fluttering fairies and...

          A Nightmare comes barreling towards Cupcake. It screeches to
          a halt, inches from the girl's face. She gently taps the
          creature on the nose and turns into a Dreamsand Unicorn.

          A gigantic Dreamsand dinosaur foot comes down revealing a
          Dreamsand brontosaurus. As Dreamsand creatures fill the
          streets, the Guardians and children rejoice.

          Jamie stands in awe of a school of beautiful Dreamsand fish
          as they float by. Suddenly, he's hit in the head with a
          snowball. He turns to look and sees Jack, smiling. Jamie
          picks up a snowball and throws it at his friends. Almost
          instantaneously, a snowball fight ensures.

          North tosses Jack a small item. Jack catches it and looks to
          his open palm, it's a Russian nesting doll in the image of
          Jack, similar to those found in North's workshop. Jack
          smiles and North gives him a wink in return.

          Pitch groans in pain, and rises up to see the town crawling
          with Dreamsand creatures, snowballs flying and yetis playing.

          He whips around to see the kids - having the time of their
          lives - and no fear in their eyes. He rises up, his entire
          body shaking with rage, and screams at them.

          He lunges at Jamie who come running toward him, Pitch's hands
          outstretched as if he's going to grab him by the throat. But
          Jamie runs right through him, laughing, joyous.

          Pitch gasps, realizing that he no longer has any power over
          the children. The devastation plays across his face.

          He sees the Guardians approach, standing side by side with
          one another. Pitch turns and flees into the forest.

          Pitch runs through the shadows in terror. He comes crashing
          through the trees of the forest, and out onto the ice of the
          pond. He looks over his shoulder to see if the Guardians are
          on his tail, when BOOM! He runs smack into North's chest.
                         
          Pitch slips on the ice, and falls backwards. He looks up to
          see North smiling down at him.

          Tooth tosses something to Pitch which he catches. He looks
          down. It's a quarter.

           A quarter?
                         
          BLAM. A fist punches him right in the jaw, and a single
          tooth goes skittering across the ice. Tooth shakes out her
          hand.

          Hundreds of Nightmares emerge from the woods, surrounding the
          pond. It's terrifying, but the Guardians seem unphased.

          He tries to run, but it's impossible to get his footing on
          the ice. He falters, and is swept up in the stampede of
          Nightmares. The streaks of black whip and latch themselves
          onto Pitch as the black cloud carries him through the forest.

          Pitch struggles to escape, but the mass of black sand pulls
          him deep into the forest, under the frame of the broken bed,
          and back down into the dark depths of the underground. He
          looks up at the moon as he disappears and the hole in the
          earth seals itself up.

          Moon? Jack smiles as he looks up at it. He hears Tooth's
          laugh and turns to find North, Tooth, Bunny and Sandy, their
          faces shining with pride.
                         
          Tooth comes flying in to give Jack a hug. She lifts him off

          Jamie and his friends along with a crowd of yetis, elves, and
          eggs all make their way across the pond to the rest of the
          group. As they approach we see settle on Jamie, who stands
          at the center of the group.

           To guard them with your life -
           their hopes, their wishes, and
           their dreams? For they are all
           that we have, all that we are and
           all that we will ever be."
                         
          Jack takes a second to look back at Jamie, then back to
          North.
                         
                          JACK
           I will.

           for you are now and forevermore...a
           Guardian.
                         
          Jamie and the kids erupt in a CHEER, as do the Yetis and
          Eggs.

          North picks up Jack, gives him a hug, and kisses him on both
          cheeks. Jack winces, then looks up to North with a smile.

          Imitating North, an elf picks up the elf standing next to him
          and gives him a big kiss. After an awkward pause, the
          affectionate elf is punched in the face.
                         
          Jack looks to see several fairies hovering nearby, forming
          the shape of a heart. One of the swooning fairies faints and
          falls to the ground.

          a landing. The tie-dyed elf rescues a lone egg from the skis

          Jamie smiles. Jack stands up and heads toward the sleigh.
          Jamie's friends stand off to the side rubbing their eyes as
          they become drowsy.

          Jamie runs over and wraps his arms around Jack. For a
          moment, Jack's astonished and then gives Jamie a warm
          embrace. Jack stands up and gets in the sleigh with the rest
          of the Guardians.

          spite of it all, he doesn't want to let go. The sleigh takes
          off into the sky. Jamie stops unable to follow.

          Jack moves to the back of the sleigh as the Guardians pat him
          on the back. Jack smiles...and forms a snowflake in his

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          The intense BUZZING of summer insects and the SONG of
          songbirds. A birds eye view of a bucolic mid west farming
          landscape, corn field, blue skies, sunshine, a FARMER
          PLOUGHING a nearby field with a TRACTOR, grain silos and a
          hay stack. A MAN with a horse. A clapboard house with a
          strawberry field, a woman's hand picks strawberries; a WOMAN
          lying in grass, lazing...

          OPENING CREDITS...

          INT. DINING ROOM/HOME - NIGHT

          Next to book shelves and an upright piano, with sheet music
          on the stand - CHOPIN. There is also a dining room table with
          leftovers from an abandoned meal - strawberries and cream.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

          MONTH LATER - a warm night, the MAN is asleep with the same
          WOMAN, now pregnant, no sheets on the bed. The MAN is
          restless and wakes. A distant RUMBLING, indistinct - the MAN
          swings his feet off of the bed and goes to the window,
          anxious.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The MAN is in his shorts, sweating, putting a plug in the
          bath and turning on the taps as far as they will go. The
          WOMAN appears in the doorway in a nightdress and leans
          against the door frame watching, blearily, cradling her
          pregnant belly.

          WOMAN. 
          Why are you taking a bath? 

          MAN. 
          I'm not. 
          The WOMAN takes off her nightdress and goes to the bath. 

          WOMAN. 
          You'll sleep better. 
          He looks at her, surprised she's misunderstood. 

          MAN. 
          I'm not! Put your clothes back on. 
          She sees he's looking out the window now - there's an eery 
          rose-colored glow of distant fire through the glass - and 
          distant shouts and screams...

          TITLE: THE ROAD.

          EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN

          A MAN of about forty and a BOY of ten are asleep, camped on a
          tarp under a rock ledge, the blackened chasm of a burnt
          valley spread out below. It is the same man seen earlier -
          but ten years older, thinner, malnourished, with a thick
          beard. They are both emaciated and exhausted, their faces and
          hands coated in grime and soot from the burned, blackened
          landscape around them. Ash falls on the tarp, which is bright
          synthetic blue, the only color in sight.
           The MAN is woken by something, he instinctively reaches out 
           to touch the BOY, his hand rests on his chest and rises and 
           falls with each of the sleeping BOY's breaths. 
           There is a low RUMBLE, the ground starts to TREMBLE and the 
          BOY wakes. 

           BOY. 
           Papa? (NO REPLY.) Papa? 

           MAN. 
           Shh. It's okay. 

           BOY. 
           What is it, Papa? 
          They listen as it grows NEARER and LOUDER, everything
          SHAKING, tree roots GROANING and SPLITTING, until it passes
          between them with a ROAR like a subway train right beneath
          them. The BOY is now clinging to the MAN and crying, his head
          buried against his chest in fear.

          MAN. 
          Shh. It's all right. It's all 
          right. It's gone. 

          BOY. 
          What was it, Papa?

          MAN.
          It was an earthquake.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          In the burnt, barren landscape, through swirls of soft ash
          and smoggy air the MAN appears dressed in a filthy old PARKA
          with the hood up, a knapsack on his back, pushing a rusted
          shopping CART with a bicycle mirror clamped to the handle and
          the BLUE tarp now covering it's load. The little BOY,
          similarly dressed with a KNAPSACK on his back, shuffles
          through the ash at his side - like Depression-era Dust Bowl
          homeless.
           There is a flicker of lightning over head, then more, but no 
          thunder. 

           MAN. (V.0.)
          The clocks stopped at one seventeen
          one morning. There was a long shear
          of bright light, then a series of
          low concussions.

          EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/ CRACKED ROAD - DAY 

           Broken asphalt, the earthquake has caused a large FISSURE to 
          open up ALONGSIDE the road, with a sheer drop. 
           THE MAN and THE BOY edge past burnt trees and scrub. 

          MAN. (V.0.)
          Within a year there were fires on
          the ridges and deranged chanting.
          The screams of the murdered. By day
          the dead impaled on spikes along
          the road.

          EXT. LAKE - DAY 

           They trudge past a vast lake filled with dead trees... 

           MAN. (V.0.) 
           I think it's October but I can't be 
           sure. I haven't kept a calender for 
           5 years. 

          EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY 

          They truck along with the trolley through the fog, the
          ghostly shapes of dead trees on either side and the shapes of
          barren mountains in the background...

          MAN. (V.0.)
          Each day is more gray than the one
          before. Each night is darker -
          beyond darkness. The world gets
          colder week by week as the planet
          slowly dies. No animals have
          survived. All the crops are long
          gone.

          EXT. EDGE WOODS - DAY 

           A tree falls behind them with a WHUMP and they jump... 

           MAN (V.0.) 
           Someday all the trees in the world 
           will have fallen. 

          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 

           The MAN forages for petrol, checking the nozzle of the pumps, 
           rummaging through empty oil cans, he upends a bin to get at 
          the empty oil bottles. 
           The BOY picks up a phone on a wall and listens to the dead 
          earpiece. 

           MAN. (V.0.)
          The roads are peopled by refugees
          towing carts and road gangs
          carrying weapons, looking for fuel
          and food.

          EXT. LONG ROAD - DAY 

           They head down a long straight road towards a dark, 
           forbidding looking tunnel - a turnpike. 

           MAN. (V.0.) 
           There has been cannibalism. 
           Cannibalism is the great fear. 

          EXT. CITY - DAY 

           They emerge before a view of a deserted city-state... 

          EXT. MALL - DAY

           They forage in a deserted mall... 
           There are skeletons and human bones here and there.

           Mostly I worry about food. Always
           food. Food and our shoes.
           CU - the BOY examines the head of a moose mounted on a wall 
          in a SEARS hunting store. 

           MAN. (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Sometimes I tell the boy old
          stories of courage and justice -
          difficult as they are to remember.
          All I know is the child is my
          warrant and if he is not the word
          of God, then God never spoke.

          EXT. RIDGE/ CAMPSITE - (CAMP 2) - EVENING 

           They are camped high up on the ridge of a mountainside. 
           There is a camp fire with wet clothes hanging to dry on
          sticks beside it.
           The MAN is erecting the tarp over string tied between two 
           sticks stuck in the ground. The BOY is sitting lighting a
           lantern using the scavenged oil inside the makeshift tent, 
           his shadow stark against the illuminated tarp. 

           BOY. 
           Now you can read me a story. 
           He gets out a BOOK and looks at the pictures in the
          lamplight.
           The MAN reads him a story... 

          EXT. RIDGE/CAMPSITE - (CAMP 2) - NIGHT 

          The MAN awakens bathed in firey light as if the sun has come
          out. There is pale gray snow all around him with a quivering
          orange glow. He gets up to investigate, looks to the line of
          trees up the ridge where a FOREST FIRE is burning, CRACKLING
          in the distance. He stands staring at the fire, the warmth
          and light moving him, enlivening him and not frightening him
          at all. The BOY has got up and appears at his side, yawning.
          He looks at the sky at a single gray SNOWFLAKE drifting down.

          BOY.
          It's snowing!

                         (CONTINUED)

          MAN.
          It's like it used to be when the
          sun came out.
           The BOY catches the snowflake in his hand, surprised.

          EXT. ROAD/PLAIN - DAY

          They travel along the road through drifting wood smoke, smoke
          pouring off the ground like mist and thin black trees burning
          like candles on the snowy ridge.
          They reach a spot where fire has crossed the road melting the
          tarmac. Their feet stick in the molten tarmac, it sucks at
          their shoes and they stop. Just ahead they see a set of foot
          prints in the tar and study them.

          BOY.
          Who is it?

          MAN.
          I don't know.
          The MAN looks through a pair of BINOCULARS and sees: A
          stooped figure up ahead, a DYING MAN dragging one leg
          slightly, limping along. He stops and stands uncertainly,
          then continues. The BOY sees him too.

          BOY.
          What should we do Papa?

          MAN.
          We're all right. Let's just follow
          and watch.

          BOY.
          Take a look.

          MAN.
          Yeah. Take a look.

          EXT. ROAD/HILL - LATE AFTERNOON

          The DYING MAN is getting slower and slower as they climb a
          slope, following, until he finally stops and simply sits in
          the road. The BOY hangs onto the MAN's coat anxiously as they
          approach.
          POV BOY - the DYING MAN is burnt, his clothing scorched and
          skin black with soot. One eye is burnt shut and his hair is a
          nitty wig of ash. His shoes are bound with wire and coated
          with road tar.

                         CONTINUED:
          As they pass by the DYING MAN looks down, averting his eyes.
          The BOY keeps looking, unable to take his eyes off him.

          BOY.
          Papa, what's wrong with that man?

          MAN.
          He's been struck by lightning.

          BOY.
          Can't we help him? Papa?

          MAN.
          No. We can't help him.
          They keep walking away and the BOY tugs at the MAN's coat.

          BOY.
          Papa?

          MAN.
          Stop it.

          BOY.
          Can't we help him, Papa?

          MAN.
          No. We can't. There's nothing to be
          done for him.

          EXT. BRIDGE - (CAMP 3) - EVENING

          They are camped under the bridge, ash and slurry drift by on
          the river, a dull sulphur light from the fires glows against
          the sky. The BOY sits in silence with his back to the MAN. 

          MAN.
          There's nothing we could have done.
          (NO REPLY.) He's going to die. We
          can't share what we have or we'll
          die too.

          BOY.
          I know.

          MAN.
          So when are you going to talk to me
          again?

          BOY.
          I'm talking now.

                         (CONTINUED)

          MAN.
          Are you sure?

          BOY.
          Yes.

          EXT. BARN - DAY

          They come to a barn beside the road. They look at each other.

          MAN.
          Let's take a look.
          The man picks up the revolver and they go inside cautiously.

          INT. BARN - DAY

          Three pairs of FEET wearing different shoes - a man's shoes,
          a woman's shoes, and a CHILD's sneakers - hang above three
          carefully placed chairs.

          MAN.
          Don't look.
          The BOY looks at the ground.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You don't need to see this.
          The BOY takes a few steps, exploring, he eyes the empty hay
          loft but avoids looking at the hanged bodies.

          BOY.
          There could be something here.
          There could be corn or something.

          MAN.
          No, they ran out of food.

          BOY.
          Maybe we could find some hayseeds
          in the hayloft?
          Now the BOY goes over to the swinging CORPSES, oddly curious.

          MAN.
          It's not what-you think. They
          committed suicide.

          BOY.
          What does that mean?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          You know what that means.
          The MAN GOES outside while the BOY thinks about it a moment.

          EXT. FARM GATE - DAY

          They walk away from the eerily silent farm, stopping at an
          abandoned TRACTOR by a weathered, paint stripped letter box. 

          MAN.
          Come here.
          The BOY goes over and the MAN takes out his revolver, opens
          the magazine and shows him: two bullets in the chamber.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You see that? Two left. One for you
          and one for me.
          He places the BOY's thumb on the hammer and cocks the pistol.
          He curls the BOY's index finger around the trigger.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You put it in your mouth and point
          it up. Like this. Just like I
          showed you.
          He puts the barrel of the pistol in his own mouth until the
          BOY nods, wide eyed. He takes the pistol out of his mouth and
          uncocks it.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You got it?

          BOY.
          I think.

          MAN.
          Is it okay?

          BOY.
          Okay.
          The MAN puts the gun away and cuddles the BOY close. They set
          off again.

          INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

          FLASHBACK - the WOMAN is sitting by the window, staring out
          at the garden which is barren now, the sky gray but tinged
          with the same fireglow seen earlier, a film of gray ash
          covers dead lawn and shrubs and inside the paintwork is grimy
          and colorless now, a lot of the furniture gone. A pile of
          broken up furniture and pieces of the piano are-stacked up
          next to the fireplace. In the fireplace the scorched, ashen
          remains of piano keys. The WOMAN is now heavily pregnant. The
          MAN sets down chipped old plates and spoons, spoons beans
          from a pot and sits to eat.
          As the WOMAN starts to eat she winces and freezes with a look
          of horror, spoon halfway to her mouth. She looks down and

                         SEES:
          POV WOMAN - water and blood running down her legs. 

          WOMAN. 
          Oh no. Oh no.

          MAN.
          It's okay, I'll help you. Just like
          we said.

          WOMAN.
          No no no...

          MAN.
          I'll heat water. We can do it. 
          As he goes out she MOANS in despair.

          INT. KITCHEN/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

          The MAN rushes in and opens a drawer in the sideboard.
          Instead of cutlery it contains a pair of kitchen shears, a
          bottle of antiseptic, worn but clean towels and a pair of
          worn out yellow rubber dish gloves, all laid out in
          readiness.
          The WOMAN appears at the door, blood running down a leg.

          WOMAN. 
          We don't have to.

          MAN.
          Well, I think we probably do.

          WOMAN. 
          What kind of life is this?

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          It's life. It's the only thing
          left.
          He takes the WOMAN back into the other room.

          INT. DINING ROOM / CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 

           TERRIBLE SCREAMING. The WOMAN lies on the dining room table 
           SCREAMING as she has her first contractions. The MAN is
           wearing the rubber gloves, one gloved hand resting on the 
           WOMAN's leg, about to deliver his own baby. He wipes his brow 
          and leaves a smear of blood as the SCREAMING goes on.

          WOMAN. 
          I can't.

          MAN.
          It's coming.

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          INT. TRAILER HOME - (CAMP 4)- EVENING 

           Inside a badly damaged trailer home, one wall half fallen 
           off, a pan of water boils on a small fire. The BOY sits 
          shivering in a blankets as he eats beans from a tin, scraping
          around for the last one or two. The MAN opens his knapsack by
          the fire and produces a packet of COCOA. He fixes a cup of
          cocoa for the boy. He hands the BOY the cup of cocoa and as
          the BOY examines it and drinks, the MAN surreptitiously pours
          himself a mug of water and sits blowing on it. The BOY
          realises the MAN has left him all the cocoa.

          BOY.
          You promised not to do that.

          MAN.
          What?

          BOY.
          You know what, Papa. I have to
          watch you all the time.

          MAN.
          I know I'm sorry.

          BOY.
          If you break little promises you'll
          break big ones. That's what you
          said.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN relents, pouring the hot water back into the pan and
          taking some of the BOY's cocoa into his own cup. The BOY
          wipes his finger around the inside of the empty bean tin and
          licks his finger.

          MAN.
          Watch your finger.

          BOY.
          You always say that.

          MAN.
          That's because you always do it.
          The MAN spreads bits of a worn out road map on the boards and
          studies them.

          BOY.
          What are you doing?

          MAN.
          We have to keep moving. We have to
          go south to the coast.

          BOY.
          Why?

          MAN.
          It'll be better at the coast.

          BOY.
          Why?

          MAN.
          Because we're going to freeze here.
           He picks up the map pieces carefully. 

          EXT. TURNPIKE - MORNING 

           The MAN and the BOY truck along the blacktop. 
          At the crest of a hill they come to FADED BILLBOARDS
          advertising MOTELS and stop. The BOY notices a sign in the
          distance, which has words painted over a faded advertisement:
          odd, nonsensical, Biblical ramblings about "bones" and "the
          dead." The MAN follows the BOY's gaze and reads: "BEHOLD THE 

          VALLEY OF SLAUGHTER - JEREMIAH 19:6." 

          MAN.
          Do you remember your alphabet?

          BOY.
          Yes.

          MAN.
          Can you read that?

          BOY (SCRUTINISING IT.)
          No.

          MAN.
          Good, let's go. 
          The MAN takes out a large REVOLVER, cocks it in readiness and
          places it on the tarp as they move. The BOY eyes the MAN
          nervously, eyes the gun and they move off. 

          EXT. TURNPIKE, TUNNEL APPROACH - DAY 

          They trudge along the turnpike towards the opening of a deep,
          black tunnel and the BOY suddenly comes to a stop,
          increasingly upset, unable to face the yawning mouth of the
          tunnel.

          BOY. 
          I can't, I just can't... 

          MAN. 
          There's no other way. 

          BOY. 
          We could go over. 

          MAN. 
          We can't take the cart over. 

          BOY. 
          We don't know what's in there. 

          MAN. 
          There's nothing in there. It's just 
          the same as it is out here. Okay? 

          BOY. (BEAT. VERY RELUCTANT.) 
          Okay. 
          The boy sticks close to the MAN's side. The man has the 
          revolver in his belt now and his parka unzipped, ready as 
          they nervously walk towards the mouth of the tunnel. 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          INT. TUNNEL - DAY

          The MAN has his arm around the boy as they push the cart
          cautiously ahead, acutely aware of all that's around them.
          They pass footprints in the dried sludge on the ground. Ash
          and litter blowing about and a handful of MUMMIFIED DEAD
          REFUGEES appear along the sides of the tunnel, sitting and
          lying on camp stretchers, their bags and supplies long since
          looted. They are shrivelled and drawn like latterday bogfolk,
          shoeless, a couple of men, a woman a small child and a DOG.
          The MAN stares at the group. 
          The BOY stares at the small child and then at the mummified 
          DOG, transfixed. The MAN puts out his hand for the BOY to
          take - the BOY takes his hand and the MAN moves him on.

          MAN.
          Just remember that the things you
          put into your head are forever.

          BOY.
          But you forget some things don't
          you?

          MAN.
          You forget what you want to
          remember and you remember what you
          want to forget.

          EXT. TUNNEL EXIT AND TURNPIKE - (CAMP 5) - EARLY MORNING 

           The MAN and the BOY are asleep inside an abandoned car 
           amongst a line of other abandoned vehicles littering the 
          turnpike. 

          INT. ABANDONED CAR - (CAMP 5) - EARLY MORNING 

           Now the BOY's hand rests on the MAN's chest as he sleeps. The 
          MAN breathes stertorously, wheezing a little and the BOY'S
          small hand goes up and down on his chest.
          Suddenly the MAN wakes and rolls onto his side, listening,
          the revolver lying beside him. He slips his hand onto the
          revolver and raises his head slowly. He looks around - 
          nothing but the sound of a distant DIESEL ENGINE. He looks at
          the BOY fast asleep. When he looks back at the tunnel he sees 
          a nightmarish vision:

                         CONTINUED:
          POV MAN - Exiting the tunnel, shuffling through the ash, a
          group of HOODED MEN, some in gas masks and filthy biohazard
          suits, slouching along, coughing, casting their heads from
          side to side and swinging clubs and lengths of pipe - a ROAD
          GANG. The MAN listens to the sound of a DIESEL TRUCK behind
          the gang.

          MAN.
          Quickly. Quick...
          The BOY jolts awake as the MAN shoves his pistol in his belt,
          grabs the boy by the hand. They slide out of the car and 
          crouch on the ground, the BOY is frozen with fear. 

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          It's all right. It's all right but
          we have to run. Don't look back.
          Come on.
          Their backpacks are still left in the back of the car... 

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Run... run...
          The flat bed truck RUMBLES into view, MEN from the GANG
          standing on the flat bed looking around, some holding rifles.
          The BOY falls and the MAN pulls him to his feet with such
          force he lifts him clean off the ground and has to dangle him
          back down again.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
           You okay? It's all right... come
           on...
           They rush down the embankment into the trees alongside the 
          turnpike. 

          EXT. TURNPIKE UNDERPASS - DAY 

           They run through the woods. The truck is heard in the 
           background, the motor missing and SPUTTERING, coils of black 
          diesel smoke coiling through the woods. The motor dies with a
          flapping RATTLE and there's SILENCE. 
          The MAN and the BOY crouch in frozen silence, the Truck now
          on the overpass nearby, dangerously exposed to the view of
          the Gang. They listen to the GANG TALKING and raising the
          hood of the truck
          The MAN puts his arm around the BOY and draws his pistol as 
          they see the truck begin to roll, the GANG pushing it... but 
          it coughs and stalls again.

          16.

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN sees one of the GANG MEMBERS coming down the
          embankment, unbuckling his belt. He is emaciated, in dirty 
          blue overalls and a gas company cap, and has a long beard cut
          square at the bottom and a bad tattoo of a bird on his neck.
          He doesn't stop, just keeps coming, closer and closer until
          he's just feet away, almost on top of them. He unzips his
          pants and takes a piss. As he stands pissing his eyes roam
          around - at any moment he could look to the side and see them
          crouching there.
          The MAN is wide-eyed, gun ready, eyes darting from the GANG
          MEMBER to the BOY to the GUN. The GANG MEMBER rolls his
          shoulders and exercises his neck... he looks down and studies
          the steam coming off his piss.
          The MAN silently trains his pistol at the head of the GANG
          MEMBER who, as if by instinct, rolls his head around and
          looks right at him.

          MAN.
          Just keep it coming.
           The GANG MEMBER sees the gun and stops pissing, looks back at
          the truck, zips his fly.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
          Don't look at them. Look at me. If
          you call out you're dead. Where you
          from?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Does it matter? Where you from?

          MAN.
          What's the truck running on?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Diesel fuel.

          MAN.
          Where d'you get that?

          GANG MEMBER.
          I don't know.

          MAN.
          You don't know, huh?
          The GANG MEMBER just stares, not answering.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (2)

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You got ammunition for those
          rifles?
          The GANG MEMBER looks back towards the truck.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          I told you not to look back there.
          Where d'you get all that stuff?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Found it.

          MAN.
          What are you eating?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Whatever we can find.

          MAN.
          Whatever you can find, huh?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Yeah...
          Now the GANG MEMBER looks at the BOY, causing the MAN To
          raise the revolver and cock it.
          POV GANG MEMBER - he looks down the barrel at the magazine
          and sees empty space.

          GANG MEMBER. (CONT'D)
          You won't shoot that thing. You
          ain't got but two shells. Maybe
          just one. And they'll hear the
          shot.
          On the over pass the ROAD GANG are looking around, MURMURING
          as they notice one of their number missing.

          MAN.
          Maybe. But you won't. It'll be
          through your skull and inside your
          brain before you can hear it.
          The MAN steps closer and aims the gun at the MAN's forehead,
          hammer back, ready.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          To hear it you'll need a frontal
          lobe and things with names like
          colliculus and temporal gyrus and
          you won't have them anymore because
          they'll just be soup.

          GANG MEMBER.
          Are you a doctor?

          MAN.
          I'm not anything anymore.

          GANG MEMBER.
          We got a hurt man. It'd be worth
          your while.
          The MAN glances in the direction of the ROAD GANG, then back
          at the GANG MEMBER, who is still eyeing the BOY. The BOY is
          sitting with his hands on top of his head, peeking out
          through his arms, terrified as the tension escalates.

          MAN.
          If you look at him again I'll shoot
          you in the head.

          GANG MEMBER.
          I'll bet that boy is hungry. Why
          don't you all just come onto the
          truck. Get something to eat. Ain't
          no need to be such a hard ass.

          MAN.
          You don't have anything to eat.
          Let's go.

          GANG MEMBER.
          I ain't going nowheres.

          MAN.
          You think I won't kill you but
          you're wrong.

          GANG MEMBER.
          You know what I think? I think
          you're chickenshit. You never
          killed a man in your life.
          He drops his belt on the ground with a CLATTER, a canteen and
          army pouch hanging from it. The MAN eyes the army pouch, eyes
          the GANG on the road - and notices for the first time some of
          them are wearing the same army pouches.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         CONTINUED: (4)
          One is banging his stick on the side of the truck to call
          their lost member. The MAN is distracted by this and when he
          looks up the GANG MEMBER has taken two silent steps and is
          standing between him and the BOY, holding a knife.

          MAN.
          What do you think you're going to
          do with that?
          Without a word the GANG MEMBER dives and grabs the BOY, rolls
          and lands on his feet holding the BOY against his chest with
          his knife at his throat. Simultaneously the MAN drops to his
          knees, trains the pistol and fires from six feet away,
          shooting the GANG MEMBER in the forehead. He falls back and
          lies with blood bubbling from the wound, eyes open, the BOY
          lying in his lap in shock, deafened, expressionless, covered
          with gore and mute as a stone.
          The GANG hear the loud SHOT and freeze, they start looking
          around them more urgently now. The MAN grabs the dazed BOY by
          the hand and yells but in his deafness the BOY hears only a
          MUTED soup of words:

          MAN (MUTED.)
          Move! Let's go!
          The MAN shoves the pistol in his belt, hoists the BOY onto
          his shoulders and sets off down the road at a run.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          They crash through the woods, the MAN straining to keep the
          BOY aloft and find a path through the trees - the BOY
          clutching the MAN's head with both hands.
          There's a sickening THUD and the MAN falls, the BOY flying
          off with a cry. The MAN struggles to gather his wits, unsure
          whether he's been felled by another man.

          MAN (MUTED.)
          Come on. Get up, get up quickly!
          The MAN swings the BOY onto his shoulders and runs.

          EXT. WOODS/TURNPIKE - DAY 

          The MAN and BOY stagger through trees and the man drops to
          his knees, letting the BOY down. They are back by the
          turnpike again. They listen and watch, utterly exhausted and 
          out of breath, the MAN is wheezing, the BOY at his side,
          holding his hand, staring, in shock still.

          MAN.
          Shh. It's okay now. You're going to
          be OK.
          POV BOY - the BOY can still HEAR nothing, temporarily deaf.
          But he sees the MAN talking and looking around, through 360
          degrees, trying to work out where it's safe to go.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
          Come on.
           He grabs the BOY's hand and they take off again.

          EXT. WOODS - EVENING

          The MAN pulls out blankets from his knapsack. The BOY sits
          staring, shocked as the MAN tries to wipe the blood and gore
          from his face but it's thick and congealed now. His hands
          tremble as he tries to pick it from the BOY's hair.

          MAN.
          It's okay... it's okay now...
          Frightened by the BOY's muteness, he wraps him in a blanket,
          unzips his parka and holds him close under the parka.
          The MAN picks up his revolver, checks the chamber, only one
          bullet left. He eyes the flickering shadows in the distance
          and then eyes the BOY, making minute calculations of
          distance, calibrating the space between the ROAD GANG and the
          BOY. He holds the revolver up and cocks it.

          MAN. (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I try to look like any common
          traveling killer but my heart is
          hammering. When it comes to the boy
          I have only one question: Can you
          do it? When the time comes?
          There is no moon, but not far away, perhaps 30 yards, a firey 
          TORCH makes its way through the woods. About 50 yards away
          from that another TORCH is being used to search... shadows
          flicker ominously. The sounds of TWIGS snapping underfoot and
          BRANCHES being broken as the ROAD GANG searches wordlessly,
          just BREATHING heavily through their masks and beards. The
          MAN clutches the BOY tighter, and stifles a cough.
          They remain frozen like this, unable to budge.

          FADE OUT.

          EXT. EMBANKMENT - DAWN

          They are by a thin, toxic, rust-red stream, slushy ice at the
          edges and gray froth. The MAN leans down and pushes ice away 
          and scoops up a hand full of gray water. He runs it through
          the boy's hair to wash it and the BOY flinches with cold. He
          rubs more icy water into the BOY's hair, roughly, quickly,
          with a sense of panic as he helplessly tries to-wash out
          lumps of flesh and blood. The BOY is weeping silently and
          shivering from the extreme cold as the MAN picks out the
          dried gore and washes the hair clean.

          MAN.
          It's no use crying. You have to
          talk to me.
          He takes the blanket and dries the BOY's hair as he talks.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to let anything
          happen to you... I'm going to take
          care of you... I'm always going to
          try and be here for you... and I'm
          going to kill anybody who touches
          you.
          He smooths the BOY's hair down with shaking fingers, clumsily
          trying to brush it out of his eyes, a fatherly instinct to
          make the BOY neat.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Because that's my job. Do you
          understand?
          When he's through the MAN lifts the BOY's thin arms, puts a
          vest over his head, then a ragged sweater, then he folds the
          BOY into his parka, zips it up to the neck and kisses him on
          the top of the head.
          The MAN grabs his knapsack, tips it upside down, rummages
          inside - it's empty.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
          Come on, we need to get the cart
          back.

          EXT. EMBANKMENT BY TUNNEL EXIT - DAY 

          Approaching the embankment, the MAN walks quickly and
          stealthily, wired, listening to the silence, straining to

          22.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY stumbles along behind, slower, fatigued, makingthe
          MAN anxious. The MAN leaves the boy hiding:

          MAN (WHISPERS.) 
          Wait here.
          He starts to climb the embankment and hears: little running 
          FOOTSTEPS as the BOY comes after him, he turns to face the
          BOY urgently, exasperated.

          MAN (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D)
          No I need you to wait. I'll hear
          you if you call. I'll just be a
          little ways and I'll be able to
          hear you if you get scared and you
          call me and I'll come right away.
          He walks off but hears... the little BOY's FOOTSTEPS running
          after him again - he turns around.

          MAN.
          I said wait!
          The BOY's face crinkles up and a tear rolls down.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Stop it. I need you to do what I
          say. Take the gun.
          The BOY freezes, refusing to take the gun.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Just take it will you?
          The BOY shakes his head.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          We don't have time for this. We
          need our food. What's left.
          The MAN shoves the gun into the BOY's hand.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
           Don't argue.
           He creeps up the embankment. The BOY just stares at the 
          revolver.

          EXT. TURNPIKE ROAD - DAY 

           The MAN searches for the cart. He comes to where they'd left 
           it in between the abandoned cars.

          23.

                         CONTINUED:
          Their backpacks lie open on the ground, next to the cart on
          it's side, it's contents spilled out, mostly plundered, just
          a few children's BOOKS and TOYS, old pots and pans, shoes and
          ragged clothing remaining. Nearby are the remains of a large
          campfire in the middle of the turnpike. The man collects up
          the few remaining possessions and puts them into the
          backpacks.
          POV MAN - he sees charred billets of wood, ash and... the
          bones of the shot ROAD GANG MEMBER. Nearby is a pool of his
           blood and guts, still gently STEAMING, the head decapitated 
           and rolled under a car. He nudges the bones with the toe of 
          his shoe. 

          EXT. EMBANKMENT BY THE TURNPIKE - DAY 

          Below, down the embankment the BOY is waiting obediently with
          the gun.
          The MAN heads back to the BOY, trying to think what to say.
          The BOY hands the gun back and takes the MAN's hand and they
          walk away into the woods, the MAN tucking the gun back into 
          his belt. 

          MAN.
          Let's get out of here. The
          freeway's too dangerous. Find the
          back roads.

          BOY. 
          Okay. 

          INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - NIGHT 

           FLASHBACK - Now the house is in considerable disrepair, no
           furniture, the skirting boards falling away, large cracks in
           the walls, cornices and lamp fittings pulling away from the
           ceilings, water marks from rain, the windows covered with 
           corrugated iron sheets. The MAN and the WOMAN are sitting 
          across from each other with a lamp illuminating the dark.
          Between them lies the revolver seen earlier. The WOMAN picks 
          up the gun and swings open the magazine. There are two
          bullets in it, she takes them out and places them on the
          table, one after the other.

          WOMAN. 
          That's all that's left. I should
          have done it when there were more
          bullets in the gun.
          The MAN shuts his eyes, unable to take it. In the corner, the
          BOY is standing in the background, drawing on the walls.

          WOMAN. (CONT'D)
          Sooner or later - no listen - they
          will catch up with us and they will
          kill us. They will rape me -

                         NO -

          WOMAN. 
          And they will rape him

          MAN.
          Please no - just - no

          WOMAN. 
          They are going to rape us and kill
          us and eat us and you won't face
          it. You'd rather wait for it to
          happen.

          MAN.
          Please.

          WOMAN. 
          Stop it.

          MAN.
          I'll do anything.

          WOMAN. 
          Such as what?
          She picks up the revolver and puts the TWO BULLETS into the
          chamber.

          WOMAN. (CONT'D) 
          I thought about not even telling
          you. Just doing it. I'd empty every
          godamn bullet into my brain and
          leave you with nothing.

          MAN.
          Don't say that. Don't talk this
          way.

          WOMAN. 
          There's nothing left to talk
          about... my heart was ripped out of
          me the night he was born...

          MAN.
          Please don't do this. I won't let
          anything happen. We'll survive.

          WOMAN.
          I don't want to survive! I'd take
          him with me if it weren't for you.
          You know I would. Why can't you
          face it?

          MAN.
          Will you listen? You're talking

                         CRAZY -

          WOMAN. 
          It's not crazy and you know it.
          It's the right thing to do.
          They glance at the BOY. 

          WOMAN. (CONT'D) 
          Other families do it.
          She goes to the BOY, strokes his hair, kisses him, makes a
          reassuring display of being motherly.

          WOMAN. (CONT'D) 
          Time for bed, there's a good boy.
          She picks him up in her arms and carries him off to bed.

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          EXT. RAVINE/WATERFALL - DAY

          The THUNDER of a waterfall, the river disappears into space -
          the BOY and the MAN stand staring up at the waterfall, 80 
          feet above, shrouded in gray mist. A color spectrum is 
          visible rising from the waterfall, like a rainbow - the boy
          is transfixed, clutching the MAN's arm for safety.

          BOY.
          What is it?
          The MAN looks at the BOY, surprised he's talking again.

          MAN.
          It's a waterfall.

          BOY.
          Look. Colors.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          There used to be color everywhere.
          You don't remember. It was before
          you were born. There used to be so
          many thnings... 
          The BOY approaches the water's edge, shallow and clear with 
          gravel and pebbles sparkling at the bottom. He scoops up some
          water, surprised that it seems clean.

          BOY.
          Look. It's clear.

          MAN.
          Do you want to go in?

          BOY.
          I don't know.

          MAN.
          Sure you do.

          BOY.
          Is it okay?

          MAN.
          Just don't swallow any.
          The MAN unzips his parka and slips it to the ground. The BOY
          eyes the MAN, surprised - then does the same.

          EXT. RIVER/WATERFALL - DAY

          Naked, pale, filthy dirty and shivering with cold, the BOY
          frolics in the spray of the waterfall. The MAN watches him 
          enjoying himself by the waterfall, clutching his shoulders, 
          hopping up and down, he joins him.

          EXT. RAVINE/ROCKFACE - (CAMP 6) - EVENING 

          The MAN has strung the tarp against a rockface to make a
          shelter. He meticulously filters water through a rag into a
          pan. In the background, the waterfall can be heard RUMBLING.
          The BOY has painted his face with CRAYONS, drawing a bizarre
          set of FANGS and dripping blood around his mouth. The MAN
          studies the BOY's painted face a moment.

          MAN.
          Listen. That man back there...
          there's not many good guys left,
          that's all. We have to watch out
          for the bad guys.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          And we have to talk. Always. We
          have to just... you know... keep
          carrying the fire...

          BOY.
          What fire?

          MAN.
          The fire inside you.
          The BOY is thoughtful a minute, and then:

          BOY.
          Are we still the good guys?

          MAN.
          Yes. We're still the good guys.

          BOY.
          And we always will be no matter
          what happens?
          He eyes the BOY uncertainly, unsure if he can promise this.

          MAN.
          Always will be. Yeah.
          The MAN goes back to tying the tarp.

          EXT. THE RIVER/VALLEY - MORNING

          The MAN and the BOY are trudging along, away from the 
          waterfall now.

          MAN.
          We have to keep moving. Other
          people might be attracted to the
          waterfall just like we were. We
          wouldn't hear them coming.
          They stop to look at a lake surrounded by fog down in the

                         VALLEY

          BOY.
          Do you think there could be fish in
          the lake?

          MAN.
          No. There's nothing in the lake.
          They move on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          EXT. BACK ROAD - DAY 

          They come around a bend in the road and immediately hear the 
          ROAR of river rapids. Up ahead they see a bridge with a jack-
          knifed TRUCK on it.

          EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

          They walk out onto the bridge over GREY FROTHING WATER, and
          inspect the truck. The tyres are flat, the cab jammed against
          the railings. The trailer end has swung across the road,
          knocked out the railings and lies with it's last few feet
          hanging over the side of the bridge, blocking the bridge off
          completely.

          EXT. ABANDONED TRUCK - DAY

          The MAN climbs up onto the gas tanks, wipes the glass and
          peers into the cab. He swings the door open and climbs
          inside, pulling the door shut behind.

          INT. TRUCK/CAB - DAY

          He looks around at discarded detritus, old magazines and
          trash. He checks behind the seats where there is a mattress
          on a bunk and calls out.

          MAN.
          Come up here.

          INT. TRUCK/CAB - (CAMP 7) - NIGHT

          SNOW continues to fall on the dusty WINDSCREEN. Outside, all
          around snow falls, silently, covering the truck and the
          bridge, transforming it. They are both still awake, unable to
          sleep, staring at the transformed world, carpeted by snow.

          BOY.
          I'm hungry.

          MAN.
          I know. So am I.

          BOY.
          Can I ask you something?

          MAN.
          Of course.

          BOY.
          Are we going to die?

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          No. Sometime. Not now.

          BOY.
          And we're still going south?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          So we'll be warm?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          And there might be food there?

          MAN.
          Everything depends on reaching the
          coast.

          BOY.
          Okay.
          The MAN draws a blanket around him and kisses him goodnight,
          it is now pitch black.

          MAN.
          Go to sleep.

          BOY.
          I wish I was with my mom.
          They are silent a moment, until:

          MAN.
          You mean you wish you were dead.

          BOY.
          Yeah.

          MAN.
          You mustn't say that. It's a bad
          thing to say.

          BOY.
          I can't help it.

          MAN.
          I know but you have to. You have to
          stop thinking about her. We both
          do.

          BOY.
          How do I do that?
          The MAN is silent, lost in thought.

          EXT. TRUCK/CAB - (CAMP 7) EARLY HOURS

          The man gets down from the cab and walks a few feet in the
          dark and snow. He coughs a bit, takes a few breaths of air,
          and walks away from the truck, vanishing into the mist.

          EXT. CAMP/ROAD - (CAMP 7) - EARLY HOURS 

          The MAN is alone now by the road. He takes out his WALLET and
          sifts through: money, ancient cards, driver's license and a
          picture of HIMSELF and the WOMAN on their WEDDING DAY, which 
          he studies a moment sadly.

          MAN. (V.0.)
          She was gone, and the coldness of
          it was her final gift... she died
          somewhere in the dark... there is
          no other tale to tell.
          He lays everything out on the grey slushy ground, then flings
          the wallet into the river and walks back to camp, leaving the
          PHOTO and cards to blow away.

          EXT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE/YARD - NIGHT

          FLASHBACK - The WOMAN kisses the MAN. 

          MAN.
          Will you tell him goodbye?

          WOMAN. 
          No. I won't. I can't.

          MAN.
          Will you at least wait till
          morning? Stay with me through the
          night.

          WOMAN. 
          No. I have to go now.
          They kiss again, she turns and walks away out of the yard.

          MAN.
          What am I going to tell him? What
          are we going to do without you?

          WOMAN.
          You should move south. You won't
          survive another winter here.
          The MAN follows a few steps and she stops and turns to him.

          MAN.
          Why won't you help me?

          WOMAN. 
          I can't help you. Don't you
          understand? This is how I'm helping
          you.

          MAN.
          Where are you going to go? You
          can't even see.

          WOMAN. 
          I don't need to see.

          MAN.
          I'm begging you.

           WOMAN. 
           Please don't. Please.
           The MAN stares. She goes, vanishing into the darkness. 

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          EXT. CITY LIMITS - DUSK 

           The MAN stares. In the distance, a dead city. 

          EXT. OVERPASS/CITY LIMITS - EVENING

           The MAN and the BOY approach the edge of the city. Up ahead a 
          cluster of three tall buildings, a dozen or so floors of
          concrete and glass, the upper floors of one illuminated by
          the flickering fire glow of candle light inside. The MAN
          stops and stares and the BOY follows his gaze.
          In one of the illuminated windows a SILHOUETTE FIGURE stares
          back at them, somebody in the building. In another window
          another SILHOUETTE FIGURE is staring out, motionless, they
          could be refugees, cannibals or more mummified dead for all
          we know.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY.
          Who are they, Papa?

          MAN.
          I don't know.

          BOY.
          What if it's more bad guys?

          MAN.
          It won't be more bad guys. Don't
          worry. Stay close.
          He takes hold of the gun and they walk in a different
          direction now, giving the high rises a wide berth.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
           Keep low. We'll be okay.
           When they get to the end of the block they stop and the MAN
           checks around the corner before they cross the street. In the 
           distance three men appear, emaciated, slow-moving. They step 
           forward, stop and watch the BOY and the MAN. 

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS/CITY - DAY 

           The MAN, now carrying the revolver, and the BOY head off down 
           a railway track that leads away from the city. 

          EXT. COUNTRY RAILWAY LINE - DAY 

          In the country, along the railway, they see past a small road
          to a once grand house on a rise. It is tall and stately with
          white Doric columns across the front and a gravel drive that
          curves up from the road through a field of dead, foot long
          grass. They stand there staring at it, the BOY still holding
          the MAN's hand. The MAN listens - nothing but the WIND in the
          dead bracken, a CREAK of a door or shutter rattling.

          MAN.
          I think we should take a look.

          BOY.
          I'm scared.

          MAN.
          There's nothing to be scared of.

          EXT. DRIVEWAY/STATELY HOME 

          The MAN sets off up the drive. He stops and faces the BOY who
          is rooted to the spot.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          You want to stay here?

          BOY.
          No.
          The BOY joins him and they set off slowly up the drive,
          through patches of melting snow. There is a tall dead privet
          fence with a deserted birdsnest in it.

          EXT. PORCH/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They climb the steps to the porch, the BOY clutching the
          MAN's hand. They notice a window is slightly open. The MAN
          goes to it, opens the window wide, looks inside.

          INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They climb through the window onto black and white marble
          tiles and the MAN carefully shuts the window a little so it's
          the same as when he found it. They regard the room, 
          binoculars set up on a tripod sit next to an arm chair. An 
          elaborate staircase in front of them, William Morris wall
          paper, water stained and sagging, plaster moldings and
          cornices sagging from the ceiling.
          They cross back to the other side where there is a great hall
          of a drawing room, high ceilings, huge fire place with raw
          brick around it where the wood has been stripped, a pile of 
          warm-weather clothing, boots and backpacks on the floor by 
          the hearth. 

           BOY.
          Papa?

           MAN.
          Shh.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They creep in and find blackened pots and pans, a cord with a
          bell for servants, trash piled on the floor and work tops, a
          rusted sink covered in mould, bare cupboards. In the floor is
          a hatch with a lock set in a steel plate. The man examines it
          while the BOY tugs at his arm, frightened.

          BOY.
          Papa, let's go.

          MAN.
          There's a reason this is locked.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY is now panicky, hopping about, close to tears.

          BOY.
          Don't open it - don't!

          MAN.
          I need something to pry it open.

          BOY.
          No!
          The MAN goes out abruptly and the BOY follows, wringing his
          hands in fear.

          EXT. BACK GARDEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN comes out the back door with his revolver drawn,
          looks around and sees an old station wagon with flat tyres on
          the dead grass. Beside it is a 40 gallon cauldron on the
          blackened remnants of a fire. There is also a wooden SMOKE
          HOUSE with thin wisps of smoke coming off it. The MAN studies
          it nervously, sniffing the air, then goes to the tool shed
          and starts sorting through tools. He finds a long handled
          spade and hefts it in his hands.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The spade chops into the wood around the lock on the hatch.
          The MAN hacks away, then prizes up the hatch, lock and all,
          revealing a gap of darkness.

          BOY.
          Papa...

          MAN.
          Listen to me. Just stop it. We're
          starving. Do you understand? I have
          to do this. I don't have any
          choice.
          The MAN opens the hatch fully and lies it on the floor.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Just wait here.

          BOY.
          I'm going with you.

          MAN.
          Okay. Just stay close to me.
          Nothing's going to happen.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         CONTINUED:
          They descend the rough wooden steps.

          INT. CELLAR/STATELY HOME - DAY

          There is a terrible stench and they have to cover their
          mouths and noses with their parkas. The MAN gets out his
          lighter, lights it and tries to light the way.
          POV MAN - BLACKNESS except the small area illuminated by the
          lighter as the MAN searches: part of a stone wall; then a
          clay floor; an old mattress with dark stains. The glow of the
          flame crawls across the floor to a corner as the MAN steps
          closer, then plays the lighter along from the corner to

                         REVEAL:
          Huddled against the wall, all trying to hide, shielding their
          shining eyes from the light, NAKED MEN and WOMEN, thin as
          skeletons like inmates in a death camp. The BOY jumps,
          shocked and the MAN freezes, staring, dumb struck by:
          On a mattress on the floor lies a NAKED MAN with his legs
          gone to the hip, their stumps blackened and burned,
          cauterized. The BOY covers his eyes.

          MAN.
          Jesus...
          The MAN on the MATTRESS turns to them and WHISPERS, a low
          indistinct murmur at first.

          MAN ON MATTRESS.
          Help us... please help us...

          MAN.
          Christ... oh Christ...
          The others join in, an eerie chorus of WHISPERING, "Help
          us... please help us..." The MAN turns and grabs the BOY and
          rushes for the steps.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Hurry... go... move!
          The MAN drops the lighter as he tries to push the BOY up the
          steps. Out of nowhere a BEARDED FACE appears at the foot of
          the stairs, blinking.

          BEARDED FACE.
          Please... they're taking us to the
          smoke house.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BEARDED FACE reaches out and feebly tries to grab the
          MAN's arm but he breaks free and concentrates on getting the
          BOY up the steps, following in a blind panic, fumbling and
          missing his footing.

          MAN.
          Hurry - hurry!
          They scramble up the steps towards the light of the hatch as
          the BEARDED FACE reaches out and tries one last time to grab
          at the MAN's feet but he kicks free.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN scrambles out, slams the door shut and drags a solid
          table over the door. He looks around for the BOY.

          MAN.
          Christ. Run!
          The BOY is near the window, dancing up and down in terror,
          pointing out the window to:

          EXT. FIELDS - DAY

          Coming up the path toward the house are four BEARDED MEN and
          two WOMEN, all suspiciously well fed and healthy-looking. One
          of the MEN holds hands with one of the WOMEN, as if they were
          returning from a stroll before dinner.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN stares a moment, frozen with horror, then grabs the
          BOY by the hand and jerks him away.

          MAN.
          Run. Run!

          INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They tear through to the front door, the MAN fumbles to get
          it open but it has a well-maintained deadlock on it. He
          stares out the window next to the door and sees:
          POV MAN - The WELL-FED PEOPLE are climbing the steps of the
          porch. The MAN Grabs the BOY and they rush through into
          kitchen.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          In the kitchen the hatch is being lifted from underneath and
          the table elevating inches. They rush back out again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY

          As they reach the stairs, a key turns in the lock and the MAN
          picks up the BOY in his arms and they sprint to a door under
          the stairs. As they get through the door the front door
          swings open and the WELL-FED PEOPLE drift inside.

          INT. REST ROOM - DAY

          They are in a small rest room under the stairs, just a toilet
          and a basin. The BOY's face is level with the basin and while
          the MAN is holding the door shut the BOY comes face to face
          with the contents of the basin:
          POV BOY - bloodstained clothing soaking in bloody water and
          tallow in the basin. Around the basin are bloody red hand
          prints on the white porcelain.
          POV MAN - through a thin crack he sees the WELL-FED PEOPLE on
          the far side of the foyer, chatting casually. He is not close
          enough to hear everything they say, but close enough to see
          that the MEN's beards are trimmed and they wear well-repaired
          clothes.

          WELL FED WOMAN.
          I'm going to freshen up.

          BEARDED MAN.
          I need a drink.

          WELL FED WOMAN 2. 
          I'm going up to change.
          He hears one of the WOMEN STOMPING across the old floorboards
          and up the stairs to change while the other WOMAN takes a few
          steps towards the rest room, then turns back towards the
          window as the conversation lurches on.

          BEARDED MAN 2.
          Who left this window open?

          WELL FED WOMAN. 
          I leave it open for the smell.

          BEARDED MAN 2.
          What smell?

          WELL FED WOMAN. 
          You don't smell it anymore?

          BEARDED MAN.
          Who wants a drink?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CONTINUED:
          They hear the sound of the WINDOW BEING CLOSED and LATCHED.
          As all this goes on, the MAN is frozen, eyes wide with fear,
          he slips the pistol from his belt, cocks it and squats on his
          haunches so he's close to the BOY, desperate, unable to
          decide what to do, unable to think straight with fear.
          The BOY is staring from the door to the pistol to the
          bloodied basin as if hypnotised, in shock, babbling somewhat.

          BOY. (MUMBLING, TO SELF.)
          Bad guys... bad men...

          MAN.
          Shh, shh...
          There are FOOT STEPS outside the door as the WELL FED PEOPLE
          drift closer and then away again. The man starts to cough but
          he has the revolver in one hand and the BOY's hand in his
          other. The MAN tries to stifle his cough but can't. Then the
          BOY notices and holds his own small hand to the MAN's mouth,
          stifling his coughing as the talk goes on outside:

          WELL FED WOMAN.
          Will you help me with the dirty
          dishes?

          BEARDED MAN 2.
          I'm hungry.
          As the coughing subsides a little the MAN takes the BOY's
          hand from his mouth and pushes the revolver into it.

          MAN.
          Take it.
          The BOY tries to resist, shaking his head, terrified, mute.

          MAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D)
          Take it.
          The MAN puts his left arm around the BOY's tiny, thin
          shoulders and holds him close.

          MAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D)
          Don't be afraid. If they get hold
          of you, you're going to have to do
          it just like everybody else. Do you
          understand? Shh. No crying. Do you
          hear me?
          The WOMAN turns from the window and one of the BEARDED MEN
          pours whiskey and hands her one.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The BOY is weeping and shaking his head as the MAN shows him
          again what to do with the gun.

          MAN (WHISPERS.)
          Stop crying. You have to be a brave
          boy. You know how to do it.

          BOY (WHISPERS.)
          I think so.

          MAN (WHISPERS.)
          Say "Yes I do Papa."
          He stares down at the little BOY who just holds the gun
          feebly... he realises the BOY won't use it. After a moment of
          torturous contemplation, the MAN very gently takes the gun
          from the BOY's hand and the BOY sits forlornly, staring down
          at his hands, afraid to look at the MAN now. When the BOY
          looks up again he is staring down the barrel of the pistol,
          the MAN aiming the large revolver at the BOY's forehead.

          BOY.
          What are you doing?
          The MAN's hand shakes, his thumb trembles on the hammer as he
          cocks it...

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Papa?

          MAN.
          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

          BOY.
          Will I see you again? When will I
          see you?
          The MAN's finger trembles on the trigger as he slowly
          squeezes it... At that moment there's a loud THUMP from the
          kitchen and the WELL FED PEOPLE stop and listen, then rush
          through to the kitchen, and immediately there's a commotion
          as they see the state of the hatch with the table over it.

          BEARDED MAN 2(O.O.V.)
          What the fuck do you think you're
          doing? Huh? What the fuck do you
          think you're doing...?

          WELL FED WOMAN (O.O.V.)
          Don't look at me like that. What
          are you doing?

          The MAN gathers his wits and opens the door a crack.

          MAN.
          Follow me, take my hand, don't let
          go.

          INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN bursts out of the rest room with the BOY and they
          make a dash for the open window. He sticks his gun in his
          belt and wrestles with the window, an old colonial style
          frame which sticks.
          From behind the closed kitchen door they hear muffled GRUNTS
          and SHOUTS until the MAN wrenches the window open, stuffs the
          BOY through and follows.

          EXT. PORCH/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN picks the BOY up and they rush down the steps.

          EXT. DRIVEWAY/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They rush down the driveway and the MAN drags the BOY through
          a gap in the dead privet hedge onto the road.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          They hesitate a moment on the road, deciding.

          MAN.
          Come on, keep running!
          They rush across the road to the woods on the other side, the
          BOY ahead as the MAN checks behind them. The MAN looks back
          towards the house and two of the WELL-FED PEOPLE have come
          outside, looking around suspiciously.
          He hits the ground and takes the BOY with him, they lie flat
          at the edge of the woods and the road. They are wildly out of
          breath, chests heaving, the MAN coughing.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Keep your head down.
          POV MAN - the WELL-FED PEOPLE walk a few steps down the drive
          and a BEARDED MAN looks through BINOCULARS at the road and
          the woods, but not directly at the MAN and the BOY hiding.
          The WELL FED PEOPLE start looking around the side of the
          house, walking away. The MAN and the BOY get up, dash through
          the treeline and disappear into the woods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 

          .A dull moon hidden in the ashen sky and the outlines of trees
          as they set off through the woods, sleepy, stumbling like
          drunks now. They hear a hideous SHRIEK in the distance,
          coming from the house. They stop, hearing another SHRIEK and
          a MAN'S SCREAMING. The MAN holds the BOY close and tries to
          cover the BOY's ears as they stare and wait for-it to pass.

          MAN. 
          We'll be safe soon. 

          BOY. 
          They're going to eat those people 
          aren't they, Papa? 
          The MAN does not answer.

          EXT. SEARS DEPARTMENT STORE/SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT

          They are back in the city, trudging through the parking lot
          of a huge shopping mall, just outside what used to be SEARS
          department store. A dull moon hidden in the ashen sky
          illuminates the ruined store front as the MAN looks up at the
          mall, thinking. The BOY is just staring into space, still in
          shock.

          INT. SEARS/MALL - (CAMP 8) - NIGHT

          The MAN and the BOY have set up camp in the mall, outside the
          SEARS entrance. The MAN is building a big fire. The BOY
          stares through the glass at the deserted department store.
          Nearby, strewn across the doorway are bunches and bundles of
          cash in notes and coins... the BOY looks closer and finds
          expensive items of jewelry still in their boxes, LOOTED from
          the store and discarded.

                          
          The BOY sits, he looks like he's given up, and then: 

          BOY. 
          Papa? Papa, we wouldn't ever eat
          anybody would we?

          MAN.
          No. Of course not.

          BOY.
          No matter how hungry we were. Even
          if we were starving?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          We're starving now.

          BOY.
          Because, because we're the good
          guys?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          And we're carrying the fire.

          MAN.
          Yes.
          The MAN takes the BOY in his arms. In a moment the BOY starts
          blinking sleepily and drifts off to sleep and the MAN strokes
          the sleeping BOY's hair and kisses him on the forehead.

          EXT. SUPERMARKET/PARKING LOT - DAY

          They walk through the parking lot until the come to a
          supermarket around the other side. A few old cars in a trash
          strewn parking lot. The MAN heads through the defunct
          automatic doors.

          MAN.
          Come on. There's nobody here.

          INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

          The MAN and the BOY trudge the empty aisles, only litter
          remaining, the once brightly-colored packaging strewn around,
          it's contents long since looted.
          In the empty gun section there is a deer's head mounted on
          the wall. The BOY stops and stares, mesmerised while the MAN
          searches the empty shelves for ammo, finding only empty
          boxes.
          The MAN glimpses a woman's face staring dolefully from an
          aisle - an emaciated, dead beat SCAVENGER watching them,
          vanishing as quickly as she appeared. 
          On their way out they come to a pair of vending machines 
          tipped over, the sodas looted, coins scattered around in the
          ash. The MAN sits beside one and feels inside the gutted
          machine, eventually producing a single unopened can of COCA

          COLA.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY (EXCITED.)
          What is it, papa?

          MAN.
          It's a treat for you. Here. Sit
          down.
          He helps the little BOY off with his knapsack and sits him
          down and opens the can of COKE ceremoniously. The BOY looks
          startled and sniffs the fizzing can as if it's the strangest
          thing he's ever seen in his life.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Go ahead.
          The BOY takes the can.

          BOY.
          It's bubbly.

          MAN.
          Go ahead. Drink it.
          The BOY takes a sip and considers.

          BOY.
          It's really good. You have some,
          papa.

          MAN.
          No. I want you to drink it.

          BOY.
          But I want you to have some.
          The MAN reluctantly takes the can and has a tiny sip, hands
          it back to the wary BOY.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          It's because I'll never get to
          drink another one, isn't it?
          The MAN doesn't know what to say.

          EXT. MALL/PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

          They head out of the mall now towards the road, lifeless
          traffic lights at the intersection, town houses and apartment
          blocks on the other side of the road. The BOY stops to
          listen, stares around, suddenly energised, bobbing on his
          toes.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          What's wrong with you?

          BOY.
          What was that?

          MAN.
          I didn't hear anything.

          BOY.
          Listen.

          MAN.
          I don't hear anything.
          They listen more until, very faintly we hear a DOG BARK in
          the distance. The BOY turns around 180 degrees to listen,
          alert with anticipation.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          It's a dog.

          BOY. (EXCITED.)
          A dog! Where did it come from?

          MAN.
          I don't know. Come on.
          The MAN walks across the road, past the apartments and the
          BOY follows, bouncing up and down, over-excited now.

          BOY.
          We're not going to kill it are we
          Papa?

          MAN.
          What? No, we're not going to kill
          it. Why did you say that?

          BOY.
          You still got one bullet left.

          MAN.
          We're not going to hurt the dog, I
          promise. We're not going to kill it
          and we're not going to eat it
          either.

          BOY (OVER EXCITED, NOT FRIGHTENED.)
          Maybe it'll eat us!

                         (CONTINUED)

          MAN.
          I doubt it very much.

          BOY.
          Can we look for it?

          MAN.
          It's gone, okay?

          EXT. SUBURBS - DAY

          They trudge through the suburbs on the edge of the city, past
          what used to be the local ball park, now barren, dead, a vast
          flat expanse of ash and cracked, scorched earth, forlorn
          stands and bleachers blackened by ash and soot.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          I used to watch the ball games here
          with my father.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

          They walk up a once tree-lined suburban street, barren now,
          ash and dust layer what used to be front lawns, post boxes,
          picket fences, porches, crazy paving. The MAN stops outside a
          typical, suburban clapboard house with a dead, cracked yard
          where the lawn used to be and a bare flag pole. The BOY eyes
          the MAN enquiringly.

          BOY.
          What is this place, Papa?

          MAN.
          It's the house where I grew up.
          They go up to the house - clapboards have been removed for
          firewood leaving studs and insulation exposed. The BOY stops,
          reluctant to go further, and the MAN takes a few more steps
          then turns around to check on him.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You coming?

          BOY.
          I don't want to.

          MAN.
          Don't you want to see where I grew
          up?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY.
          There might be somebody in there.

          MAN.
          There's nobody there now.
          The MAN takes the BOY's hand and they approach a basketball
          hoop by the garage. The MAN is momentarily overcome with
          emotion as he recalls the details, but it doesn't mean much
          to the BOY.
          After a moment the MAN goes up the steps - frightened, but
          horribly compelled at the same time. The BOY follows
          nervously.

          BOY.
          I'm scared.

          MAN.
          We've got to find something to eat.

          BOY.
          I'm not hungry. I'm not!
          The MAN takes his revolver from his belt and approaches the
          front door, warily pushing it open.

          MAN.
          We'll be all right. Come on.
          He goes through the front door - the BOY stays where he is,
          rigid with fear. The BOY notices a stuffed toy dog in the
          window, staring out at the garden and his curiosity takes
          over. The BOY goes inside carefully.

          INT. DINING ROOM/HOME - EVENING

          The pine panelling is stripped from the walls, there is some
          broken furniture but much has been taken for firewood. They
          go over to the fireplace and the MAN examines it. He runs his
          fingers along the mantle where there is an old drawing pin
          still stuck in the wood, nostalgia overcoming his fear.

          MAN.
          This is where we used to have
          Christmas when I was a boy. We'd
          hang our stockings right here.
          The MAN examines the yellow tiled surround. The BOY watches
          the MAN as if he's gone mad.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          My mother scrubbed these every day.
          It's still spotless.
          Much of the woodwork and the floorboards have been stripped
          and taken for firewood - there are gaping holes.
          By the fireplace is a small pile of bones - and--in the grid
          are more burnt bones and the skull from the family cat. The
          MAN takes it all in sadly but the BOY is unmoved.

          BOY.
          Papa? I don't think we should do
          this.

          MAN.
          You want to wait outside?
          The BOY nods vigorously.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          All right.
          He takes the BOY's hand and leads him out.

          EXT. PORCH/HOME - DAY

          The come out onto the porch.

          MAN.
          Sit here on the stoop and don't go
          away.
          The BOY sits quietly and the MAN goes back inside. After a
          moment he starts going through his knapsack, less afraid now.

          INT. OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The floorboards CREAK horribly, swollen from rain or ripped
          up, as he creeps into the living room. The timber cladding is
          stripped from the walls, the ceiling plaster is collapsed,
          beams exposed. The MAN pads through to the kitchen.

          INT. KITCHEN/OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The kitchen is similarly dilapidated, the cupboards stripped
          bare. On a shelf by the window are dusty jars of fruit,
          preserved. He grabs a jar, prizes open the lid and finds a an
          oily slick of black mucus floating in the top, like rotted
          mushroom spores. He sniffs it suspiciously, holds it up to
          the light.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         CONTINUED:
          In the light small black fish hook-shaped spores drift from
          the top of the jar to the bottom. He replaces the lid,
          appalled.

          EXT. PORCH/OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The BOY is sitting on the steps of the porch drawing with
          crayons on a pad taken from his knapsack. Across the road is
          another big old house, much of the clapboard missing, swathed
          in dead brambles - the BOY suddenly looks up and stares at
          it, distracted.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The MAN comes outside and regards the deadened yard, old
          garden hoe and spade, gardening equipment and several dead
          apple trees. He goes over and examines the ashen ground and
          digs about to unearth several small, dark brown, shrivelled 
          spheres spaced several feet apart - apples. He bends down and
          picks one up, examines, sniffs. He gathers up the strange
          apples and stuffs them in his pockets.

          EXT. PORCH/OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The BOY is still staring at the house across the road when he
          notices A GHOSTLY FACE, completely still, in a window. The
          BOY drops the pad and crayon and stands, surprised, not
          believing his eyes - it is the face of a SMALL BOY roughly
          his age, which disappears almost immediately, receding back
          into the gloom like a ghost.

          INT. PANTRY/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

           The MAN is in the looted pantry. He finds some shrivelled 
           raisins that haves spilt and hidden in the back of the shelf. 
           He puts them into a handkerchief, folds it and pockets it. He 

                         HEARS:

          BOY. (O.O.V.)
          Stop - stop!
          The MAN freezes, then charges out.

          EXT. PORCH/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

          The MAN rushes out and stares about frantically for the BOY -
          he's gone.

          EXT. HOUSE OPPOSITE - DAY

          The BOY has run across the road to another house.

                         CONTINUED:
          POV BOY - peeping around the side of the house is the other
          SMALL BOY, the same age, similarly grimy and thin, wearing an
          outsize woollen coat. The other SMALL BOY disappears down the
          side and the BOY runs after him.

          BOY.
          Wait! Come back! I won't hurt you!

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The BOY runs to the bottom of the yard where there is various
          suburban garden detritus, a dusty lawn mower, a clothes line,
          a shed, bikes with no tyres.

          BOY.
          Where are you?!
          The MAN comes sprinting up the side of the house and seizes
          him by the arm.

          MAN.
          What are you doing? What the hell
          are you doing?

          BOY.
          There's a little boy, Papa, I saw a
          little boy.

          MAN.
          There's no little boy. What's the
          matter with you?

          BOY.
          Yes there is! I saw him! A boy just
          like me.
          The MAN takes the BOY by the arm and drags him back through
          the yard, up the side of the house, the BOY resisting, crying
          and looking back all the way.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Why? Why can't I go and see him?

          EXT. HOUSE - DAY

          Out the front of the house the BOY digs his heels in and the
          MAN has to drag him, his feet slithering through the dirt.

          BOY.
          I need to see him! I need to!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          Why?

          BOY.
          I just do!
          The BOY has gone limp, weeping bitterly, resisting being
          moved. The MAN gives up and squats beside the sobbing BOY.

          MAN.
          Okay, I'm sorry. I understand.
          He holds him, wipes his tears from his cheeks.

          EXT. TOWN STREET/OVERPASS - EVENING

          In the failing light they come across a late model Chevy
          abandoned under an overpass.

          BOY.
          Papa? Will there be other boys like
          me at the coast?

          MAN.
          I hope so.
          The MAN goes to the car, wipes thick dust from the windscreen
          and peers in - it's empty.

          INT. CHEVY - (CAMP 9) - NIGHT 

          They try to get comfortable in the leather seats, the MAN
          spreading the blankets over them and tucking the BOY in. They
          are quiet a moment as they watch darkness start to fall.

                         THEN:

          MAN.
          I got you something
          The MAN produces from his pocket one of the tiny hard brown
          apples and holds it up to the remaining light.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          It's an apple.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         CONTINUED:
          He hands it to the boy who examines it curiously. The MAN
          takes out a pocket knife, takes the apple back, cuts the
          apple in half to reveal a woody brown interior. They regard
          the mahogany apple uncertainly, the MAN is the first to take
          a bite, with some difficulty. The BOY bites his half and
          makes a face.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Suck it a while and it'll soften.
          They sit sucking and chewing the ancient apple.

          BOY.
          Did you ever have any friends?
          The MAN eyes the BOY - curious at the sudden question.

          MAN.
          Yes. I did.

          BOY.
          Lots of them?

          MAN.
          Yes...

          BOY.
          Do you remember them?

          MAN.
          Yes. I remember all of them...

          BOY.
          What happened to them?

          MAN.
          They died.

          BOY.
          All of them?

          MAN.
          Yes. All of them.

          EXT. URBAN ENVIRONS (MONTAGE) DAY

           The MAN and the BOY make their way out of the ruined city.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN. (V.0.)
          He yearns for his own friends and
          imagines how things will be
          different at the coast - and that
          there will be other children
          there... .When I have nothing else,
          I try to dream the dreams of a
          child's imaginings...

          EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY 

          The MAN and BOY walk along a desolate road in what was once 
          farmland, grain silos loom ominously, still standing. 

          BOY.
          Do you know where we are Papa?

          MAN.
          I think we're about two hundred
          miles from the coast. As the crow
          flies.

          BOY. 
          "As the crow flies?"

          MAN.
          It means, going in a straight line. 
          POV MAN - In the background, something catches his eye and he 

                         FOCUSES ON:
          A frieze of HUMAN HEADS, dried with taut grins and shrunken
          eyes, perched on wooden poles. Some are tattooed with targets 
          and runic slogans. Some are skinless, with signs and words
          inked onto them. One has suture marks etched on it, like a
          blue print for assembly.

          BOY.
          There aren't any crows are there?
          Just in books.

          MAN.
          Yeah, just in books...
          The MAN stares at the heads as the BOY continues his
          conversation, distracted and not seeing the heads. 

          BOY.
          Do you think there might be crows
          somewhere?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          I don't know...

          BOY.
          But what do you think?

          MAN.
          I think it's unlikely...
          They keep walking and talking, the MAN grim-faced but the BOY
          intent on what's ahead.

          BOY.
          Could they fly to Mars or some
          place?

          MAN.
          No, they couldn't fly to Mars...

          BOY.
          Because it's too far?

          MAN.
          Yes.
          The MAN discretely hurries the BOY on with a guiding hand
          towards the woods and off the road.

          BOY.
          What if they tried and-and-and they
          just got halfway or something and
          then they were too tired? Would
          they fall back down...?

          EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 

          On the edge of the wood the MAN and the BOY stop to examine 
          footprints in the snow. 
          The MAN listens and hears: the low THUDDING of BULL DRUMS in 
          the distance. He looks at the exhausted BOY a moment.

          MAN.
          We can't go back on the road.

          BOY.
          Why, Papa?

          MAN.
          I think someone's coming.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY stares at the tracks. The MAN stares in both
          directions, examining the road in the distance. He moves a
          few paces and notices tied to a dead sapling a thin red
          neckerchief. He takes a few steps and through a gap in the
          trees sees a clearing - snow and a mass of BLOOD RED
          FOOTPRINTS, the icy snow stained blood red like a sorbet. A
          killing floor.

          BOY.
          Will they see our tracks?

          MAN.
          We'll cover them.
          The MAN moves the BOY away and kicks snow over their tracks -
          then lays fresh ones going in several different directions.
          The BOY copies him, leaving his own maze of tracks. They run 
          off keeping parallel with the road but staying off it. 
          POV MAN - in the distance TWO FIGURES appear on the road.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Here they come.
          The MAN now looks over his shoulder for a good look, then
          grabs the BOY's hand and takes off.

          EXT. HIGH GROUND - EVENING

          TWO MEN come prowling on the ROAD, they are MILITANTS from
          some sort of ARMY, wearing the same red neckerchiefs and
          carrying weapons, searching, predatory.
          WIDER - we see that only 30 feet away, concealed amongst the
          trees, the MAN and BOY are crouched in blankets, watching.
          The two MILITANTS stop and look around, as if they sense the
          BOY and the MAN - who freeze, frightened to breathe. The
          MILITANTS sniff the air menacingly.
          One of them walks over to a stone by the side of the road,
          leans down and starts sharpening his lance, made from a the
          straightened coil spring of a car. The MAN and the BOY watch -
          wide-eyed. Eventually the MILITANTS walk off up the road.

          BOY.
          What are we going to do?
          No answer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

          EXT. DEEP IN THE WOODS - (CAMP 10) - EVENING 

          There is a thick carpet of gray snow. The man lays out a tarp
          on the ground and blankets on top. Out of the murky sky more
          gray snow is falling. The MAN is distracted by a sudden
          noise, the LOUD CRACK of sheering wood - this time very
          close. He looks around just as:
          Out of nowhere a tree branch sails down, barely missing them, 
          landing with a heavy WHUMP just feet away. 

          MAN. 
          Move! Quickly! 
          He tries to get the BOY to his feet but he is limp, staring 
          around blearily, exhausted.
          They hear another loud WHUMP. Then the GROAN of timber and
          another WHUMP as trees start to keel over around them. The
          MAN grabs the BOY and runs as best he can through the snow
          and falling trees. They have abandoned their blankets, tarp
          and backpacks.

          BOY. 
          What's happening? 

          MAN. 
          Just keep moving, run! 
          They rush through the woods as more and more trees fall one
          after the other, WHUMP, WHUMP, WHUMP, great loads of snow
          falling from limbs to the ground with a BOOM, setting the
          woods shuddering. The BOY is getting bogged in the snow and
          the MAN stoops and scoops up the BOY and they cram themselves
          under a fat fallen tree to shield themselves.

           EXT. SEWER PIPE/EMBANKMENT, SNOWDRIFT - (CAMP 11) - NIGHT 

           They are huddled inside a huge SEWER PIPE, sheltering. 
           The BOY is wrapped up inside the man's coat, wet and 
           shivering, wide awake, nerves shredded, too anxious to lie 
          down and sleep now. 
          The MAN boils water in a car hubcab.
          He takes from his pocket the handkerchief filled with 
          raisins, offers them.

          BOY.
          That's all there is, isn't it?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          There's nothing left anywhere.

          MAN.
          No.
          They sit eating raisins, saying nothing until they're
          finished.

          BOY.
          Can I ask you something?

          MAN.
          Sure.

          BOY.
          Are we going to die now?
          The MAN just looks at the BOY, then looks away.

          MAN.
          What do you think is going to
          happen? We're just going to
          suddenly keel over and die? It
          takes a long time to die of
          starvation. The important thing is
          water to stop you dehydrating.
          We've got water. We'll be all
          right.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - MORNING 

          Snowed in farmland, in the background a rowoffallen and
          crumpled high tension electrical towers. Atownin the far
          distance ahead of the BOY and the MAN. TheBOYis hunched
          over with a hunger cramp. They are both wetandshivering.
          The MAN eyes the BOY anxiously.

          EXT. PATIO/TOWN HOUSE - DAY 

           The MAN stands on the back patio of a house on the edge of 
          town, the BOY at his side, fields stretching out before them,
          the land flattened and dead, ravaged fences running the
          perimeter. In the yard are a few dead trees, a fence, a metal
          tool shed, an old barbecue on the patio made from a 44 gallon
          drum. The MAN slides the patio door open and peers inside
          gingerly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          INT. BEDROOM/TOWN HOUSE - DAY

          The MAN is in the bedroom looking around for useful things -
          it has been stripped, the wooden frame gone from the window,
          the bureau ransacked and chopped up - only a summer dress on
          a wire hanger on the back of the door remains. He glances at
          empty drawers on the floor and a cupboard before turning his
          attention to the bed.
          He blinks and sways a moment, trying to focus on:
          POV MAN - underneath the filthy, dusty blankets a thin, dried
          head pokes out, the blankets pulled up to the chin. On the
          pillow are long hunks of rotted hair.

          MAN. (V.0.)
          Every day is a lie. But I am slowly
          dying. That is not a lie .I am
          trying to prepare him for the day
          when I am gone.
          He takes hold of the lower hem of the blanket and tows it off
          the bed, revealing a desiccated corpse. He ignores it,
          shaking the blanket out and folding it under his arm. He
          notices the BOY at his side, watching wide-eyed.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Nothing you haven't seen before.
          They go out.

          INT. KITCHEN/TOWN HOUSE - DAY

          The MAN opens and shuts empty cupboards, slamming the doors,
          increasingly desperate, close to tears of frustration now.
          Eventually he feels dizzy and has to sit on the floor. He
          just sits there, alone on the kitchen floor, clenching and
          unclenching his fists, his head in his hands, when he hears:

          BOY. (O.O.V.)
          Papa!
          The MAN draws his pistol and goes out, alert again.

          INT. TOWN HOUSE - DAY 

          The BOY is staring at himself in a dusty, flyblown full
          length mirror. As the MAN comes in he sees the BOY's
          reflection and his own and jumps.

          BOY.
          It's us.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY stares at his reflection - he looks like an alien,
          skinny with giant staring eyes on shaky legs.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          We look skinny.

          MAN.
          We are skinny.
          The MAN puts the blanket around the BOY's shoulders. He
          notices an old upright piano, covered in ash and dust. The
          BOY stares as he goes to it, lifts the lid and plays a chord.
          The BOY's eyes light up and he is magnetized, instantly
          coming over and waiting for the next note. The MAN plays
          another chord.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          It's a piano.

          BOY.
          What's it for?

          MAN.
          For making music. This... (HE
          PLAYS.) is music. Your mother
          played very well.

          BOY.
          I don't remember. 

          MAN.
          Before you were born. We had one 
          just like it. It was beautiful. 

          BOY.
          What happened to it?

          MAN.
          Chopped it up for firewood.
          He stares into space, slumps suddenly, overcome with emotion 
          as he remembers: 

          INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 

          FLASHBACK - Just the MAN and the pregnant WOMAN alone in the
          house, just before the BOY was born. Some of the furniture
          has been broken up for firewood - there are broken pieces by
          the fire and a huge axe propped on the hearth.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          The WOMAN stands at the piano and tries to play. She plays
          for a moment and the MAN cracks a rare smile - the piano is
          out of tune and she stops. She plays a bit more but soon
          starts to bang the keys atonally in frustration. The MAN just
          lets her get on with it until she's spent.

          WOMAN.
          I used to worry what would happen
          if there was a fire. What would I
          save? What could I bear to lose?
          There used to be so many things, so
          many beautiful things. Things
          people made. Things nature made.
          Who knew we would lose it all?

          MAN. 
          I'll strip the floorboards. 

          WOMAN. 
          You can't live without a floor. 

          MAN. 
          You can't live without a piano. 
          She starts to dismantle the piano, opening the lid, taking it 
          off it's hinges, it's heavy, she hands him the heavy lid and 
          he reluctantly dumps it on the floor. 

          WOMAN. 
          It's my piano. 

          MAN. 
          I bought it for you. 

          WOMAN. 
          It needs tuning. Who's going to 
          tune it? Can you tune it? 
          They look at each other sadly. They take the front piece away 
          and dump that. The WOMAN picks up the axe and hands it to the 
          MAN. He swings it at the frame. 

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          EXT. YARD - DAY

          The MAN walks toward a tin shed and crosses the dead grass.
          He stops suddenly. He stamps about a bit, listening. He
          continues on into the shed. Beside the shed sits an
          INDUSTRIAL GARDEN TROLLEY. The man reappears, spade in hand.
          He digs the spade into the dead grass and hear's it CHOMP
          into wood. He digs more urgently, increasingly exhausted,
          until a door is revealed in the dirt.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         CONTINUED:
          He is so engrossed he hasn't noticed the BOY standing a few
          feet away, watching with saucer eyes, scared.

          BOY.
          Don't open it, Papa.

          MAN.
          It'll be okay.

          BOY.
          Please, Papa, please.

          MAN.
          It's okay.

          BOY.
          No it's not! What if there's people
          hiding down there?
          The MAN ignores him, focussed as he chops the plywood around
          the lock, gets the spade under a corner and levers the door
          open. The BOY has his fists bunched up to his chest, bobbing
          up and down with fear.
          The MAN starts to descend a hand made wooden stair case in
          the bunker. He takes another disposable lighter from his
          pocket, gives the child a kiss on the forehead and then 
          disappears into the bunker, leaving the worried BOY staring
          after him. The BOY looks around at the deserted yard as the
          evening draws in, now even more frightened.

          MAN. (O.O.V.)
          Oh my God... oh my God!

          BOY.
          What is it, Papa?

          MAN (O.O.V.)
          Come down. Oh my God come down.
          The BOY is in the hole and down the steps like lightning.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - EVENING

           The little BOY CLATTERS down the steps. The MAN is busy 
          lighting up candles. 

          BOY.
          Papa? What did you find?

          MAN.
          Everything. I found everything.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         CONTINUED:
          Stored in the bunker are crate upon crate of canned goods:
          tomatoes, peaches, beans, apricots, canned ham, corned beef,
          hundreds of gallons of water in ferry cans and in boxes paper
          towels, toilet paper and trash bags stuffed with blankets.
          The MAN takes the BOY's hand and helps him down, then goes
          back up the steps and draws the door shut and jams a pair of
          metal pliers through the heavy inside hasp to stop the door
          being opened. He goes back down the steps to the BOY and
          holds up a candle to illuminate the shelves.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Can you see?

          BOY.
          What is all this stuff?

          MAN.
          It's food! Can you read the labels?
          The BOY stares at the brightly colored packaging, he's never
          seen anything like it before. The MAN hands the BOY a tin.

          BOY.
          "Pears." It says "pears."

          MAN.
          Yes! It does! Oh yes it does!
          Pears!
          They inspect the shelves: chilli, corn, stew, soup, spaghetti
          sauce, the BOY's eyes are like saucers.

          BOY.
          Is it real?

          MAN.
          Oh yes, it's real all right.
          The MAN pulls a box of butane lighters from the shelf and
          tests one, it doesn't work. He tests another which works, it
          has a large flame - he uses it to read the labels.

          BOY.
          Why is it here?

          MAN.
          Because someone thought it might be
          needed.

          BOY.
          But they died.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (2)

          MAN.
          Yes. What would you like for
          breakfast?

          BOY. (THINKS.)
          Pears.

          MAN.
          Pears it is.
          The MAN claws open a box and pulls out a tin of pears. He
          gets paper bowls from a stack, plastic forks and spoons, lays
          them out. He finds a camping lamp. He puts a butane cannister
          in and lights up the lamp. He finds a can opener and opens 
          the pears while the BOY watches silently, wrapping a blanket
          around himself and sitting on the soft bunk bed.

          BOY.
          Is it okay for us to take it?

          MAN.
          They'd want us to.
          The MAN dishes up two bowls of pears and they sit side by
          side on the bunk with spoons and pears.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          These will be the best pears you
          ever tasted. The best. You just
          wait.
          They eat in silence. They lick the spoons and drink the syrup
          from the bowls. The MAN feels inside his mouth with his
          fingers - the sugar irritating a sore tooth.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
           Too sweet.
           The BOY smiles, amused, and the MAN opens another tin. 

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12)- EVENING 

           Ham and powdered eggs frying in a pan on the camping stove. 
           The kettle is boiling on another ring of the gas stove. The 
          BOY just stares at the bubbling food as the MAN cooks.
          Nearby a breakfast table is set out on a stack of boxes
          acting as a breakfast bar: biscuits, a plate of butter,
          condensed milk, salt and pepper plates and utensils.

          63.

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN brings the pan over and forks over chunks of ham onto
          the pates, then spoonsfull of scrambled eggs from a second
          pan, then baked beans from a small pot. The BOY just stares,
          as if drugged, uncomprehending, the food alien to him.

          MAN.
          Go ahead. Don't let it get cold.

          BOY.
          What do I eat first?

          MAN.
          Whatever you like.
          The BOY eats a hunk of ham as the MAN pours coffee.

          BOY.
          Is this coffee?

          MAN.
          That's right. Careful it's hot.
          He hands him coffee.

          BOY.
          We did good, didn't we Papa?

          MAN.
          Yeah, we did good.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12)- NIGHT 

          The MAN puts the BOY to bed in a bunk and smooths his filthy
          hair tenderly, smiling with relief, until the BOY shuts his
          eyes and nods off. He covers the BOY with a blanket and
          kisses him. He just sits watching the BOY sleep, suddenly on
          the verge of tears.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - NIGHT 

           The MAN folds the BOY's tiny clothes, noticing the bulging 
           pockets of his pants. He empties them, creating a small pile
           of collected artefacts: a smooth stone, a marble, an old
           house key, bottle tops, a smooth, hand made Indian arrow 
           head, fashioned from stone, lastly a broken piece of a 
           woman's mother of pearl hair comb. 
           By the BOY's bunk he unfolds the crayon drawing he's been 
          working on and examines it, deeply moved:

                         CONTINUED:
          POV MAN - an eccentric, childlike drawing of the WOMAN,
          skinny like a stick figure but, inexplicably, with a brightly
          smiling face and big laughing eyes, labelled simply "mom" in
          spidery scrawl.
          Stirring classical music fades up and into:

          INT. THEATRE - EVENING

          FLASHBACK - Close in on a pair of LEGS in stockings, a summer
          dress, a WOMAN's hands holding a MAN's hand in her lap. The
          MAN feels the tops of the stockings with his fingers.
          WIDER - the MAN is with the WOMAN in a concert theatre, at a
          recital. The WOMAN wears the mother of pearl hair comb. The 
          seats are velvet, gold scrollwork adorns the boxes, an
          illustrious, fortunate world.

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - MORNING 

          The BOY wakes blearily and immediately notices his collection
          of artefacts turfed out by the bed.
          Nearby the MAN is dressing as the BOY starts gathering up his
          collection crossly, especially protective of the arrow ahead -
          or just embarrassed. They look at each other.

          MAN.
          What?

          BOY. (TEASING BUT INDIGNANT.) 
          Don't touch my stuff. 

          EXT. LAWN - DAWN

          The hatch opens and the MAN's face appears, as he looks
          around. He opens the hatch more and clambers out with a
          couple of jerry cans of water, the yard is quiet. Next, the
          BOY's face pops up and peers around. He clambers out carrying
          a big pot with a camping stove in it.

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAWN 

           They empty the jerry cans into the huge pot, light the stove
           and put the pot on the stove to heat the water. 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAWN 

           The BOY is in the bath, filthy and scrawny, as the MAN bathes 
          him, rubbing him with soap, scrubbing an oily film of scum
          from his dirty neck to reveal clean pale skin underneath.

          MAN.
          What do you think?

          BOY.
          Nice and warm.
          He washes the BOY's hair, lathing water over him with the
          pot. He has a sudden thought:

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BATHROOM/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

          FLASHBACK - the MAN watches unseen from the doorway as the
          WOMAN tenderly washes the BOY's hair - he is perhaps a year
          younger than at the start of the film - she appears lost in
          the task, enjoying it, chatting away to the BOY, momentarily
          unburdened. She sticks a finger in the BOY's ears, giving
          them a good soaping, which he likes.

          WOMAN.
          You could grow potatoes in these
          ears... 

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY 

           END FLASHBACK - now the MAN is in the tub, also scrawny and 
          filthy, lost in thought as he soaps up - the BOY helps. 

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY 

          The MAN trims his beard off with scissors in a mirror. He
          lathers up with shaving cream and starts to shave with a
          plastic safety razor. When the MAN is done he turns to the
          BOY, wiping away the foam.

          MAN.
          How do I look?

          BOY.
          Weird. Won't you be cold? 

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY

          Now the MAN is cutting the BOY's hair with kitchen scissors
          and a plastic comb.

          66.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY has a towel around his shoulders and long locks of
          hair decorate it. The MAN finishes, takes the towel off,
          wipes the BOY's neck and face with a flannel, holds up a
          mirror for the BOY to see.

          BOY.
          I look funny.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - MORNING

          They sit on the bunk bed with a checkerboard between them
          sipping thick hot chocolate made with condensed milk from
          plastic mugs and concentrating on the board, their worn out,
          wet blue jeans drying on a drying rack in the back ground.
          They are both wearing new sweaters too big for them,
          plundered from the stores. The MAN watches the BOY fondly,
          absorbed in checkers.

          EXT. LAWN - NIGHT

          Heavy rain slashes down on the lawn, already pools of water
          are flooding the lawn.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - NIGHT

          A shiny new quart of whiskey is slipped from its paper liquor
          store bag and opened with a soft CRACK. The whiskey is poured
          into a glass with a satisfying GLUG.
          WIDER - another feast is laid out, ham and powdered mash
          potato and biscuits and gravy. The BOY is eating while the
          MAN pours a whiskey. The BOY stops eating to watch the MAN
          drink the whiskey. The MAN's eyes glaze as he sips the strong
          liquor, dizzy already. 

          BOY.
          Can I try some?

          MAN.
          No. You won't like it. Makes you
          feel funny.
          The BOY stares, curious, wanting it.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You think I come from another
          world, don't you? Filled with all
          these strange things you've never
          seen.

          BOY.
          Sort of.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          Well, I do I guess.

          EXT. LAWN - EVENING

          The MAN just stands in the middle of the lawn COUGHING his
          guts up in the dark rain - again the phlemy wet cough. He
          bends over, sweating, listening, knowing it's the sound of
          fluid on the lungs.
          As he listens he hears something above the rain - he keeps
          shifting position, as if hearing different sounds from
          different directions. Nevertheless he anxiously looks around,
          then goes to the porch and drags an old mattress over, across
          the dead grass to the hatch.
          He lays it half across the hatch, crawls through the
          remaining gap and hauls the mattress the rest of the way over
          the hatch, then pulls the hatch closed with the old mattress
          lying on top. It just looks like an old mattress lying on a
          lawn in the rain.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - DAWN

          The MAN listens to the PATTER of rain and hears another
          sound... something or someone RUSTLING around the mattress
          above. He hears the sound of the MATTRESS being DRAGGED off
          of the door. He hears SCRABBLING and SCRATCHING on the door
          and freezes, staring at the lock, waiting for the
          inevitable... He quietly picks up the revolver. He looks
          across and sees the BOY is now wide awake too, staring, wide-
          eyed.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          Shh.

          BOY (WHISPERS.)
          Maybe it's a dog.

          MAN (WHISPERS.)
          It's not a dog.

          BOY. (BARELY MANAGING TO WHISPER.)
          It is! It's a dog! A dog!
          The MAN listens anxiously as the pawing and scratching
          continues, the wood over the bunker amplifying the noise. He
          cocks the revolver and positions himself under the hatch,
          ready.

          68.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          If it's a dog it'll be with
          someone.

          BOY.
          Who?

          MAN.
          I don't know.
          After a torturous moment the sounds die away.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          I'm not waiting to find out. Come
          on. Let's get out of here.

          BOY.
          I don't want to go.

          MAN.
          I know but it's not safe anymore.
          The MAN grabs his gun and cocks it, rushes about turning out
          all the lamps, and they sit anxiously in the darkness. 

          EXT. LAWN - MORNING 

          LATER - it's now lighter outside, the mattress lifts as the
          MAN opens the trap door and very carefully peeps out. He
          looks around, all angles, checking the coast is clear, then
          shuts the hatch again.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - MORNING 

           The MAN starts loading cans and packets into a carton. He 
           gathers a couple of large jerry cans of water. The BOY helps. 

          BOY.
          What are we going to do with all
          this stuff?

          MAN.
          We'll just have to take what we
          can.

          BOY.
          I wish we could live here. And we
          could keep the dog and the dog
          could catch food for us.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          Look, there is no dog, okay? I'm
          sorry but there just isn't.

          BOY.
          Well what is it!

          MAN.
          I don't know what it is!

          BOY.
          Please Papa.

          MAN.
          No.

          BOY.
          Just say it's going to be all
          right, Papa. Say it. Just say it,
          please.
          The MAN doesn't know what to say, losing patience.

          MAN.
          Listen, trouble comes when you
          least expect it. So maybe the thing
          to do is to just always expect it.

          BOY.
          Do you always expect it? Papa?

          MAN.
          I do, yes.

          BOY.
          You always think bad things are
          going to happen but we found this
          place. Maybe we'll find another
          place like this at the coast.

          MAN.
          Maybe.
          The MAN dumps the carton of food on the floor and packs
          another, organising jerry cans of water.

          EXT. LAWN - MORNING

          The INDUSTRIAL TROLLEY is loaded up and tied with a grey
          tarp. 

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY.
          What are you doing?

          MAN.
          We'll have to cover our tracks from 
          now on.
          The MAN drags the old mattress back over the entrance to the 
          bunker. He carefully covers the surrounding area with debris. 

          EXT. RIVER - DAY

          The MAN pulls the new trolley across a bridge, stagnant black
          water underneath, the trolley is now laden with jerry cans of
          fresh water and cartons containing as many tins of food and
          supplies as they could manage. The BOY trails along behind.
          They are a strange sight, clean clothed, clean shaven, short
          haired, in their new jumpers - and now both wearing new
          surgical masks which they raise off their faces to speak.
          The MAN keeps checking behind him. 
          POV MAN - he sees the glint of glass, perhaps a pair of 
          BINOCULARS watching them.
          The BOY watches anxiously as the MAN gets out his own
          BINOCULARS and looks through them.
          POV MAN - a mysterious winking glint of light which quickly
          disappears.
          POV - through a different pair of binoculars, a completely
          different POV, we see the MAN looking through his binoculars
          at us.

          MAN.
          I think they're following us.

          BOY.
          Who?

          MAN.
          I don't know.

          BOY.
          You think it's bad guys?

          MAN.
          Probably.

          BOY.
          What if it's good guys?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          I don't think we're likely to meet
          any good guys for a while. We have
          to be careful now. We've got food.

          EXT. BEND/THE ROAD - DAY

          As they round a bend in the road they see a hunched figure
          walking ahead of them. The MAN stops abruptly, gets out the
          binoculars and watches:
          POV MAN - a distant, hunched figure hobbling away from them.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          They come up behind an OLD MAN, hunched over, withered,
          silent as he hobbles ahead. He wears layers of torn clothing
          and his feet are wrapped in rags and cardboard tied with
          green twine. They slowly approach and the man stops, turns
          and watches them suspiciously as they draw level.

          OLD MAN.
          I don't have anything for you. You
          can look if you want. I got
          nothing.

          MAN.
          We're not robbers.
          The OLD MAN leans an ear forward, deaf.

          OLD MAN.
          What?

          MAN.
          I said we're not robbers.

          OLD MAN.
          What are you?

          MAN.
          We're just like you.

          OLD MAN.
          What are you following me for?

          MAN.
          We're not following you.

          BOY.
          We've got food we could give him.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          He's not getting any food.
          The OLD MAN looks away, avoiding their eyes.

          BOY.
          He's scared, Papa.

          MAN.
          Everybody's scared.

          BOY.
          Please Papa.

          MAN.

                         ALL RIGHT1
          The MAN eyes the road to the left and right, then draws his
          revolver.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          If this is an ambush, he goes
          first.
          He goes out to the trolley and rummages in it while the BOY
          and the OLD MAN stare at each other. The MAN comes back with
          a tin of fruit cocktail and a tin opener and opens it and
          hands it to the BOY. The BOY places the tin of fruit on the
          road in front of the OLD MAN.

          BOY.
          Take it. Here.
          The OLD MAN doesn't move.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          What about a spoon?

          MAN.
          He's not getting a spoon.
          The BOY urges him on, miming with his hands, as if feeding a
          raccoon.

          BOY.
          Eat it. It's good.
          The OLD MAN picks up the tin and his filthy long nails
          CLATTER on the tin as he tips it to his mouth, the juice
          running down his chin, his head jerking as he swallows.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Look, Papa. He's hungry.

          MAN.
          I see it. And I know what you're
          going to ask me. And the answer is
          No.

          BOY.
          What's the question?

          MAN.
          We can't keep him.
          They watch him eating painfully slowly. The OLD MAN finishes
          and sits down in the road holding the tin, staring at it, as
          if it might refill.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          When did you last eat?
          The OLD MAN just stares.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Do you want to eat with us?

          OLD MAN.
          I don't know. What do I have to do?

          MAN.
          Tell us where the world went.

          OLD MAN.
          What?

          MAN.
          You don't have to do anything. Can
          you walk okay?
          They help the OLD MAN off the road and hand him his cane but
          he pushes it away.

          OLD MAN.
          I can walk.
           They walk off the road towards the dead, blackened woods.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          As they leave the road the OLD MAN studies the BOY. The BOY
          goes to take his hand:

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          (TO BOY.) Don't hold his hand.

          BOY.
          He can't see.

          MAN.
          Don't.
          The trio walk into the woods.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          How old are you?

          OLD MAN.
          I'm ninety.

          MAN.
          Ninety my ass! Is that what you
          tell people? So they don't hurt
          you?

          OLD MAN.
          Uh-huh.

          MAN.
          Does it work?

          OLD MAN.
          Nope.

          MAN.
          What's your name?

          OLD MAN.
          Ely.

          MAN.
          Just "Ely?"

          OLD MAN.
          What's wrong with "Ely?"

          EXT. CLEARING/WOODS - (CAMP 14) - EVENING 

           There's a camp fire now. The OLD MAN sits wrapped in a quilt,
           eating with a spoon and-licking his plate clean. In the far 
           distance, the faint glow of fires. The orange light bounces 
          into the night sky eerily.

          MAN.
          How come you're still alive? What
          do you eat?

          OLD MAN.
          I don't know. People give you
          things.

          MAN.
          No they don't.

          OLD MAN.
          You did.

          MAN.
          I didn't. He did.
          The OLD MAN eyes the BOY, closely, half blind.

          OLD MAN.
          Are you a little boy?

          MAN.
          What does he look like?

          OLD MAN.
          I don't know. I can't see real
          good.

          MAN.
          Is that right? Can you see me?

          OLD MAN.
          No. But I can tell somebody's
          there.

          MAN (TO BOY.)
          Okay. You need to sleep. Come on.
          He gathers up the BOY and takes him a few feet away, settles
          him down in blankets while the OLD MAN stares into the fire.

          OLD MAN. 
          I had a little boy once. Gone... 
          all gone...

          that... leastways not with you I
          can't.
          When the MAN returns he has his gun which he surreptitiously
          places on the ground in full view of the OLD MAN.

          MAN.
          You can see that, right? Okay. Tell
          me now. You're not a shill for a
          pack of road agents?

          OLD MAN.
          I'm not anything. I'll go if you
          want me to. I can find the road.
          The MAN stares at the OLD MAN cynically but the OLD MAN just
          stares back blankly.

          OLD MAN. (CONT'D)
          I live like an animal. You don't
          want to know the things I've had to
          eat. When I saw that boy I thought
          I'd died and he was an angel. I
          never thought I'd see a child
          again. I never thought that would
          happen to me.

          MAN.
          He is an angel. To me he's a God.

          OLD MAN.
          Well I hope that's not true. To be
          on the road with the last surviving
          God would be a pretty frightening
          experience.

          MAN.
          Why do you say that?

          OLD MAN.
          Where men can't live, Gods can't
          either. The road gangs would tear
          you limb from limb, both of you.
          The low RUMBLE in the earth is heard again, an earthquake,
          this time in the distance. They listen a moment.

          OLD MAN. (CONT'D)
          I knew this was coming. This or
          something like it.

          There were warnings. People thought

          it.

          MAN.
          Did you try to get ready for it?

          OLD MAN.
          No. What would you do? Even if you
          knew what to do you wouldn't know
          what to do. Suppose you were the
          last man left alive?

          Maybe God would know.

          OLD MAN.
          If there is a God up there he would
          have turned his back on us by now.
          Whoever made humanity will find no
          humanity here.
          The MAN pours hot water into mugs to make coffee, hands one
          to the OLD MAN. They drink.

          MAN.
          Do you ever wish you would die?

          OLD MAN.
          No. It's foolish to ask for
          luxuries in times like these.

          EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - (CAMP 14) - MORNING 

           The BOY and the OLD MAN are standing by the trolley. The MAN 
          is watching from further away. The OLD MAN is fitting another
          can of peaches the BOY has given him into his knapsack.

                         M
          You should thank him you know. I
          wouldn't have given you anything.

          78.

                         CONTINUED:

          OLD MAN.
          Maybe I should and maybe I
          shouldn't. I wouldn't have given
          you anything.
          The OLD MAN looks around, orientating himself, and goes,
          tapping his cane, without a glance back at the BOY or the
          MAN. The MAN gives the BOY a reproachful look and the BOY
          looks defiant for the first time, a new distance between
          them.

          BOY.
          He's going to die and you don't
          care.

          MAN.
          I care enough. Maybe when we're out
          of food you'll have more time to
          think about it.

          BOY.
          You always say watch out for bad
          guys but that old man wasn't a bad
          guy and you can't even tell
          anymore.

          INT. CHURCH - (CAMP 13) - DAWN 

          The MAN and the BOY are camped inside an old church, dusty,
          faded stained glass is the only colour, startling after all
          the monochrome. The MAN and BOY are wrapped up in blankets, a
          small fire going. The BOY is asleep but the MAN is awake,
          coughing. He sits up, still coughing. He gets up and walks
          outside, trying to stifle the coughing.

          INT. CHURCH - (CAMP 13) - DAWN

           He wanders into an antechamber, coughing uncontrollably, 
           falls to his knees in a shroud of morning mist flooding the 
           church - and coughs up a gob of something dark and nasty, 
           spits it into the misty ground. 
           POV MAN - the mist before him clears to reveal a spattering 
           of dark blood on the pale ash. He stares, shocked, knowing 
          what it signifies. 

          INT. CHURCH - (CAMP 13) - DAWN 

           The BOY opens his eyes, he hasn't been asleep, listening to 
           the MAN cough, worried. The MAN returns and eyes the worried 

          BOY.

          MAN.
          What's wrong? 

          BOY. 
          I had a bad dream. 

          MAN. 
          What about? 

          BOY. 
           I don't want to tell you. Just you. 

          MAN. 
          What happened to me? 
          The BOY's face crinkles up, he starts to sob.
           The MAN coughs again and the BOY shoots out a hand, puts it 
          over the MAN's mouth to staunch the coughing. 

          MAN. (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I tell him: When you dream about
          bad things happening it shows
          you're still fighting. You're still
          alive. It's when you start to dream
          about good things you should start
          to worry.

          EXT. ROAD/RAILWAY LINE, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - DAY 

          They are trudging along the blacktop adjacent to a railway
          line. There is a SHOTGUN blast in the distance and the MAN 
          and the BOY stop and look around. The MAN checks behind him 
          instinctively.
          POV MAN - a thin spike of smoke from a campfire rising up in
          the woods behind. The BOY notices and looks behind.

          BOY.
          Do you think they're still
          following us?

          MAN.
          I think they've been following us
          for a long time.

          BOY-.
          Maybe it's Ely - the old man?

          MAN.
          How? On a broom stick?

          The BOY thinks about this for a moment as they approach the
          railway line.

          EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE (CAMP 15) EVENING 

          The MAN and the BOY are swaddled in blankets up amongst the
          rocks with a birds eye view of the road and a railway bridge
          they can see along the road and the dead trees for half a
          mile. The BOY is nodding off, his head lolling as the MAN
          keeps watch, increasingly paranoid. 

          EXT. BLUFFS, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE (CAMP 16) MORNING 

          As they come down from the bluffs, the MAN is staring into
          the dead woods where another thin stem of SMOKE is rising.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          More smoke. I think we should take
          a look.

          BOY.
          I don't want to. Let's just keep
          going.

          MAN.
          Whoever it is I don't want them
          behind us.

          BOY.
          What if they're bad guys?

          MAN.
          What if they're good guys?
          They look at each other, a stalemate. The MAN stands and
          starts to pack up the tarp.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Look. Whoever it is out there, it's
          better to know about it than to not
          know.

          BOY.
          Why?

          MAN.
          Because we don't like surprises.
          Surprises are scary.

          They could sneak up on us further
          down the road. You need to learn
          this.
          The MAN folds the tarp and sleeping blankets and starts
          heading down the slope to the trolley, the BOY following.

          EXT. CLEARING, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - MORNING 

          A deserted campsite, a campfire, recently abandoned. The MAN 
          and the BOY look around, disappointed. 

          EXT. DUNES/COAST ROAD, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - DAY 

          Open country now, completely blackened landscape under heavy 
          ash. They are stopped. The BOY unfolds the threadbare map on 
          the ground, a crayon in his hand.

          MAN.
          You know where we are?

          BOY.
          No.

          MAN.
          Where do you think?
          The BOY points to a place on the map.

          Here?

          MAN.
          No. We're closer than you think.
          He takes the crayon and points on the map.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          This is us. This is all sea.

          BOY.
          Is it blue?

          MAN-.
          The sea? I don't know. It used to

          The MAN picks up a desiccated pine cone from the ground, and
          stares at it, hollow-eyed, hungry. He squeezes it and it
          crumbles to dust. He takes a few steps, sniffing the air.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Can you smell that?

          BOY.
          It smells different.

          MAN.
          Everything is going to be
          different.

          EXT. DUNES - DAY

          The landscape has changed, dead salt bush and sand at the
          side of the road and finally, as they come around a bend in
          the road: dead sea grass sloping up to sand dunes up ahead.
          They look at each other and head for the dunes excitedly. The
          MAN hides the trolley discretely, so the BOY doesn't see his
          concern, he takes their bags, tarps and blankets with them as
          they head off for the dunes.

          EXT. TOP OF SAND DUNE - DAY 

          POV BOY - Gray beach, lead gray sea and waves rolling in
          slowly with a distant ROAR. On the beach a tide mark of wet
          gray ashy sludge and a skirt of glistening bones, fish
          skeletons bleached white on the sand.
          They take their parka hoods down and just stand there staring
          at the beach, the wind HOWLING around them, dozens of 
          bleached WHALE and FISH BONES and SKELETONS OF HUMANS who 
          have made it this far only to die. The MAN looks at the BOY
          and sees the intense disappointment.

          MAN.
          I'm sorry it's not blue.

          EXT. DUNES/BEACH - DAY

           They sit on the beach wrapped in blankets staring at a 
          surreal wall of impenetrable smog not far beyond where the
          waves are breaking. The MAN eyes the silent BOY, buffeted by
          wind, wrapped in a blanket, staring at the empty ocean...
          there is nothing and nobody there. They keep staring out to
          sea, filled with disappointment. The BOY impassively surveys
          the wall of smog which is like an iron curtain.

          BOY.
          What's on the other side?

          Maybe there's a father and his
          little boy and they're sitting on
          the beach too.

          BOY.
          And they could be carrying the fire
          too?

          MAN.
          They could be, yes.
          The MAN sees the BOY's hopefulness reappearing and strokes
          his head, his heart breaking for him.

          EXT. WATER'S EDGE - DAY

          The MAN and the BOY stand with their shoes off, the black sea
          washes up the sand at their filthy, blistered feet.

          BOY.
          What are our long term goals?

          MAN.
          "What are our long term goals?"
          Where did you hear that?

          I don't know. You said it.

          MAN.
          When?

          BOY.
          A long time ago.

          When your mother was here?

          BOY.
          I guess.

          Well, I don't either.
          They stare at the water - charred, quotidian household
          objects rolling back and forth in the surf. 

          BOY.
          Can I go swimming?

          MAN.
          Swimming? You'll freeze your nuts
          off.

          I know.

          MAN.
          I don't want to have to come in
          after you.
          The BOY lets the blanket fall and strips out of his parka and
          clothes. He runs along the beach naked, skinny and white,
          leaping SCREAMING into the icy surf.
          The MAN watches until the BOY comes out of the water, gasping
          with cold, shuddering. He wraps the BOY in the blanket and
          dries him off.

          EXT. BEACH - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 

          The BOY is wrapped in blankets by the fire as LIGHTNING
          flickers in the distance, illuminating the empty beach. The
          MAN drapes another blanket over them. He puts his arms around
          the BOY who is shivering and sweating, looking a little wild
          eyed, babbling a little.

          BOY.
          How many people do you think are
          still alive?

          MAN.
          In the world? I don't know. Not
          very many.

          BOY.

          I don't think so. They couldn't

          BOY.
          Not even if they could get there?
          If they had a-a-a spaceship?

          MAN.
          No. It's unlikely.
          The BOY stares, shivering, thinking.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Are you all right? What is it?
          He cups his hand to the babbling BOY's forehead.

          BOY.
          I don't feel so good.
          The BOY bends away and vomits and the MAN helps, rubbing his
          back and wiping the BOY's mouth when he's done.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

          MAN.
          That's okay, you didn't do anything
          wrong.
          The MAN is very worried now.

           The MAN covers the BOY in more blankets and constructs a 
           makeshift tent with the tarp as the rain falls all around. 

          MAN.
          It's okay. You're going to be okay.
          It'll pass.

          BOY.
          Don't leave me here, don't go away
          Papa. Not even for a minute.

          MAN.
          I won't go away. I'm right here.
          He sits holding the BOY tightly. He feels for the BOY's

          He drops droplets of sugar water from a bowl into the BOY's
          mouth. As the BOY shuts his eyes and dozes he checks the
          pulse at his neck and wipes his mouth with the blanket.

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - NIGHT

          The BOY is sleeping fitfully across the MAN's lap - he is
          still awake, staring in horror as the BOY sweats and shakes
          in his sleep. He wipes the BOY's brow, looks up-to the

                         HEAVENS:

          Oh no. No no. Not this. Jesus
          Christ what have you done to us?
          What have you done?

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - MORNING 

          The BOY is fast asleep, motionless but for stertorous
          breathing through his mouth. The MAN lies beside him, just
          staring at him, watching him sleep. The BOY opens his eyes
          and focuses weakly.

          BOY.
          Hi Papa.

          MAN.
          I'm right here.

          BOY.
          I know.
          The BOY shuts his eyes and goes back to sleep. The MAN
          strokes the BOY's hair tenderly, takes the pistol from his
          belt and carefully hides the pistol under the blanket by the 
          boy's side. He stands, takes one last look and walks away... 

          EXT. SPIT/WATER - DAWN

          The MAN is alone now, staring at the hull of a wrecked boat
          keeled over in ten feet of gray water a few yards out from
          the spit - a sixty footer, twin masts. Closer to shore, in
          the shallows between the boat and the sand is a grey,
          lifeless form. The man steps closer and sees:
          POV MAN - bobbing about in the tide, the bloated, rotting
          cadaver of a giant squid, eyes like dinner plates,
          translucent grey skin like an old light bulb.
          The MAN eyes it uneasily, then starts stripping off his
          clothes. He stares anxiously into the darkly roiling water
          near the boat.

          87.

                         CONTINUED:
          He looks back along the beach to the distant figure of the
          BOY, sitting up wrapped in his blankets, looking around,
          confused and scared, enough to make the MAN wince. He
          collects himself and wades cautiously into the gray soupy
          water. He takes a breath and starts swimming to the boat.

          EXT. SAND DUNE - (CAMP 16) - DAY

           The BOY is confused as he watches:
           POV BOY - the MAN swimming away.

                          FADE TO:

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 

           MYSTERY POV - over the shoulder of a mystery third person, 
           camera pushes in slightly on the BOY sleeping. 

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 

           A FIGURE's feet enters the scene behind the boy, carefully 
           walks in close around the boy. The FIGURE's long KNIFE drops 
           into the scene, held at the figure's side. 
           The BOY senses the FIGURE and wakes up to see: 
           POV BOY - a dark, hunched FIGURE standing over him. 
           The BOY looks up at the FACE and, whatever it is, he's 
          terrified. 
           The BOY SHRIEKS, terrified, scrambling away, tripping over 
           pots and pans by the fire, he gets to his feet and runs. 

          EXT. SHORELINE - EVENING 

           The MAN struggles from the water and scans the beach, no sign 
           of the BOY. He dumps a medical kit and flare pistol he's 
           found on the boat and heads for the sand dunes. 

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 

           The MAN runs over the sand and reaches the spot where he left 
           the BOY, the blue tarp blowing away across the beach, the 
           campsite and campfire disturbed. He runs up the dunes. 

          EXT. BEACH - EVENING 

           POV BOY - as he looks back he glimpses ragged FEET rushing 
           through the sand after him, a pair of hands reaching out...

          88.

                         CONTINUED:
          POV MAN - he catches up with the BOY, grabs his shoulder with
          one hand and the gun with the other.
           REVERSE ANGLE - the BOY sees it's the MAN and stops, stares, 
           still frightened, feverish, wild-eyed, confused. 

           MAN. 
           It's okay - 

           BOY. 
           A man! There was a man! I saw a 
           man. 

           MAN. 
           It's okay, he's gone now, it's just 
           me. 
           The BOY collapses, exhausted, into the MAN's arms. 

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - NIGHT 

           The MAN and the BOY return to examine the disturbed campsite. 

           MAN. 
           Oh Christ. You stupid ass! You 
           stupid ass! 

           BOY. 
           What happened? 

           MAN. 
           He stole our shoes. He stole 
           everything. 
           The BOY goes quiet, forlorn, staring around at the desolation 
          in despair. 

           MAN. (CONT'D) 
           What's wrong? 

           BOY. 
           I don't know what we're doing. 

           MAN. 
           Come here. 

           BOY.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
           Look, there are... (HE TRAILS OFF,
           LOST FOR WORDS.) There are
           people... there are other people
           and we'll find them. You'll see.
           The BOY just shuts his eyes and slumps onto the sand in 
           despair. The MAN eyes him anxiously. 

           MAN. (CONT'D) 
           Please. Listen to me. Don't lose 
           heart. 
           The MAN seizes the FLARE GUN, takes it from its case 
           hurriedly, loads it with shells - the BOY now watches, wide- 
          eyed. 
          The MAN rushes a few paces up the DUNE and looks over to
          where the trolley was hidden - he fires a FLARE into the air.
          The FLARE arcs up into the murk with a long WHOOSH and breaks
          in a cloud of light, hanging there, hot tendrils of magnesium
          drifting down to the sand. The BOY watches, curious despite
          his despair.
          The MAN strains his eyes to see: the dunes bathed in pink
          light from the flare and the sand pock-marked with the
          footprints of the STRANGE MAN in a trail leading to the spot
          where the trolley. The trolley marks trail off into the
          distance.

          EXT. NEAR BEACH - NIGHT 

           MYSTERY POV - from a distance, a third party is watching the 
           MAN and BOY bathed in the light of the flare. 
           CAMERA pushes in on the FACE watching them - bearded and 
           scarred with a wandering eye and a crushed cheekbone, a 
          veteran of many skirmishes. 

          EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT 

           The MAN and the BOY stand in their bare feet. 

           MAN. 
           Come on. We have to get our shoes 
           back. 

           BOY. (FRIGHTENED, RELUCTANT.) 
           We don't need them! 

           MAN. 
           We won't get far without them.

                         CONTINUED:
          They set off hurriedly, in their bare feet.

          EXT. COAST ROAD, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 

          On the road in the middle of a desolate landscape, the light
          is dying, the strange lattice of lightning flickering across
          the sky, the MAN and the BOY are barefoot on the tarmac.
          POV MAN - way up ahead is the hunched FIGURE seen earlier -
          the THIEF, his back to us, trundling the loaded trolley along
          the road.

          MAN.
          Come on.
          They take off after the thief, bare feet thudding on the
          tarmac, the MAN in front, the BOY trailing, trying to catch
          up. The THIEF looks back at them and speeds up, head bent
          down over the handle running for his life. When he looks back
          again the MAN has drawn his pistol and is aiming it directly
          at him.
          The THIEF stops the trolley, pulls a carving knife from his
          belt, and turns to face them, standing behind the trolley.
          His face is emaciated and twitchy, a mouth like a bombed
          grave yard - not the FACE of the man watching them in the
          sand dunes. The MAN trains his gun on him, stock still,
          holding the BOY's hand.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Get away from the cart and put the
          knife down.
          The MAN spits and brandishes the knife desperately, he's
          scrawny, sullen, bearded and filthy.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          If you don't put down the carving
          knife and get away from the godamn
          cart I'm going to blow your brains
          out.

          BOY.
          Papa?

          MAN.
          Be quiet.
          The MAN cocks the pistol and there's two loud CLICKS. 

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          God damn you.

          91.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY.
          Papa please don't kill the man.

          THIEF.
          Come on man, I done what you said,
          listen to the boy.
          The BOY starts crying - the THIEF looks at the BOY and then
          the angry MAN, this seems to be sobering. He puts the knife
          in the trolley and steps away, hands in the air, his thumbs
          are missing.

          MAN.
          How long have you been following
          us?

          THIEF.
          I wasn't following you. I saw the
          cart on the sand an' I just took
          it.

          BOY.
          Please Papa.

          MAN.
          Take your clothes off. Take them
          off, every godamn stitch.

          THIEF.
          Come on man, don't do this.

          MAN.
          I'll kill you where you stand.

          THIEF.
          Don't do this, man.

          MAN.
          I won't tell you again.

          THIEF.
          All right, all right, just take it
          easy.
          The THIEF looks at the BOY who is now covering his ears and
          the MAN takes an intimidating step closer with the gun.
          The THIEF starts stripping and piling his rags in the road.

          MAN.

          He sits naked in the road and unlaces the rotting shoes.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Put them in the cart.
          The THIEF stands and drops the shoes in the trolley.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Put the clothes in.
          The MAN drops the clothes in and stands there covering
          himself, shivering.

          THIEF.
          Don't do me like this, man. You 
          don't need to do me like this. 

          MAN.
          You didn't mind doing it to us.

          THIEF.
          I'm begging you.

          Papa.

          THIEF.
          Come on, listen to the kid.

          MAN.
          You tried to kill us.

          THIEF.
          I'm starving man. You'd have done
          the same.

          MAN.
          You took everything.

          THIEF.
          I'll die out here.

          MAN.

          The MAN grabs the trolley by the handle, pulls it around,
          puts the pistol on top and holds his hand out for the BOY.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Let's go.
          The BOY doesn't take his hand but they set off along the
          blacktop, the BOY snivelling and crying, leaving the THIEF
          shivering and whimpering.

          BOY.
          Oh papa.

          MAN.
          Stop it.

          BOY.
          I can't stop it.

          MAN.
          What do you think would have
          happened to him if we hadn't caught
          him? You've got to learn.

          BOY.
          I don't want to learn!

          MAN.
          I won't be here forever. Sooner or
          later you'll have to look after
          yourself.
          The BOY just looks at him - and keeps crying.

          EXT. ROAD/COAST, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - EVENING 

          Some distance away the BOY looks back at the THIEF, still
          crying.

          MAN.
          You have to stop crying.

          BOY.
          I can't.
          The BOY looks back one last time as the THIEF disappears from
          view - still just standing there, utterly lost.
          The MAN stops and puts his shoes on. He walks back up the
          road to the bend but the THIEF has gone.

          The MAN looks helplessly at the tearful BOY as he fits his
          shoes on for him, the tears streaking the soot on his face.

          MAN.
          What do you want to do?

          BOY.
          Just help him, Papa. Just help him.
          The MAN looks back down the road, weighing it up.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          He was just hungry Papa. He's going
          to die.

          MAN.
          He's going to die anyway.

          BOY.

          I'm scared. Do you understand? I'm
          scared.
          The MAN tries to look the BOY in the eye but he keeps his
          head bowed, sobbing.

          You're not the one who has to worry
          about everything.

          What? What did you say?

          BOY.
          Yes I am. I am the one.
          The MAN stops and faces-the innocent BOY angrily, stares,
          then relenting, summons all his strength, turns the trolley
          around and they start wheeling it back the way they came.

          As the light fades to darkness they look for the THIEF to 
          give him his clothes back and call out "Hallo!" Etc. After a
          moment they stop.

          BOY.
          He's afraid to answer.

          MAN.
          Is this where we stopped?

          BOY.
          I don't know. I think so.
          They keep walking, hands cupped to mouths, hallooing
          mindlessly. The MAN stops to rest and watches the BOY a
          moment, he has stopped crying as he calls out for the thief.
          Finally the MAN piles the THIEF's shoes and clothes in the
          road. He puts a rock on top of them.

          MAN.
          Come on. We have to go.
          The BOY eyes the clothes sadly, silent now.

          EXT. ROADSIDE DUNES, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 

          They find a spot to stop and sit, exhausted. The MAN opens
          the first aid kit he took from the boat, selects various
          pills, crushes them up, pours a cup of water from a ferry can
          in the trolley, and hands them to the BOY.

          BOY. 
          I don't want it. 

          MAN. 
          I have to get your temperature 
          down. 
          The BOY swallows the pills and the water, shivering. 

          BOY-. 
          Can I ask you something? 

          MAN. 
          Of course you can.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY. 
          What would you do if I died? 

          MAN. 
          If you died I'd want to die too. 

          BOY. 
          So you could be with me? 

          MAN. 
          So I could be with you, yes. But 
          that's not going to happen. 
          They look at each other a moment, unsure, the BOY shivering
          and sick-looking. The BOY lies down and shuts his eyes. The
          MAN puts a blanket over him. The MAN walks away a few paces
          and coughs endlessly, a nagging cough that won't go.

          EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

          THE MAN'S DREAM - a dream and a memory of an early summer
          day, the MAN and the WOMAN are in an orchard, lying in the 
          sun on a picnic blanket, an array of food, bread, fruit and
          wine beside them. The MAN lies back and the WOMAN cradles his 
          head in her lap, stroking his brow. She brings her face down
          and gently plants a simple kiss on each of his eyelids, then
          on each of his lips.
          POV MAN - the WOMAN's face, smiling a dazzling, radiant 
          smile, framed by sunlight and the indistinct shapes of leaves
          and blossom and petals against the sky - to him she is
          angelic. Then he kisses her on each eye and on the lips too -
          their ritual caress.

          END OF DREAM SEQUENCE.

          EXT. ROADSIDE DUNES, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - DAWN 

          The MAN awakes distressed, he wipes a tear, blinks in
          confusion. 
          POV MAN - the BOY is kneeling beside him, watching him 
          calmly, no longer sweating and shivering, recovered. 

          BOY. 
          Papa? 
          The MAN rouses himself, sits up and just stares at the BOY, 
          amazed, as if he has arisen from the grave 

          MAN.
          How are you feeling? 

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         CONTINUED:

           BOY. 
           I feel kind of weird. 

           MAN. 
           Are you hungry? 

           BOY. 
           Just thirsty. 
           The MAN gets up and fetches water from a ferry can in the 
           trolley, pours a cup, hands it to the BOY who drinks 
           thirstily. The MAN reaches out and strokes the BOY's hair as 
          he drinks. 

          EXT. RESORT TOWN, OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           The MAN and the BOY head towards a seaside town off in the 
          distance. 

          EXT. RESORT TOWN - DAY

          They enter a small beach resort with a faded "Welcome" sign 
          across the road, the BOY holding the MAN's hand now.

          EXT. RESORT TOWN/WATER'S EDGE - DAY

          They are down by the water. Small pleasure boats are half
          sunken in the grey water. Faded colored bunting and painted
          signs advertise ICE CREAMS, FOOD and a FUN FAIR. The BOY
          helps the man push the trolley through the sand until they 
          can go no further, they stop and drop onto the sand,
          exhausted.

          BOY.
          Can I tell you something?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          You tell me I shouldn't cry but
          I've heard you crying. I hear you
          coughing and crying to yourself in
          the night when you think I'm
          asleep.

          MAN.
          What of it?

          BOY.
          So if I shouldn't cry you shouldn't
          cry either.

                         CONTINUED:
          They look at each other.

          EXT. PORT - LATE AFTERNOON

          On the port side of town the MAN wheels the trolley through
          the deserted docks past rotten piers, a row of empty wooden
          warehouses and a rusty red tanker washed up. He is COUGHING
          and the sound echoes off the warehouse walls. The BOY is
          trailing a few paces behind, they're not speaking now.

          EXT. BACK STREET - EVENING

          As they pass the last of a row of deserted warehouses the MAN
          slows down to let the BOY catch up. But the BOY is now
          studying the ground intently. He bends down and picks up:
          POV BOY - an old cardboard match box, it's decals faded. He
          pushes the match box open to reveal a perfectly preserved
          Beetle. 

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          It's a Beetle. 
          Suddenly the beetle twitches, then activates its wings and
          flies out of the box with a BUZZ and upwards into the sky...
          The BOY and the MAN stare up at the flying creature, amazed

                         AND:
          Without warning something WHISTLES over their heads very
          close and hits the wall beside them with a loud CLATTER. The
          MAN lunges at the BOY, landing on top of him to cover him and
          tries to grab the trolley which tips over, spilling 
          everything out.
          The MAN desperately tries to take cover while he looks over
          his shoulder and sees:
          POV MAN - in the upper window of a warehouse a man is drawing
          a bow and arrow aimed right at them.
          In desperation the MAN covers the BOY and tries to scrabble
          away but there's a DULL TWANG of bowstring and an arrow THUDS
          into his leg.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Oh you bastard! You bastard!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN claws the blankets from the upturned trolley aside 
          and scrabbles around for the pistol but it has fallen from
          his belt onto the cobbles and scattered out of reach. He
          spots the flare gun and seizes it, resting it on the trolley 
          and aiming carefully at the empty window. When the lone
          ARCHER appears again he squeezes off a shot and the flare
          goes rocketing up towards the window in a firey arc, ablaze
          with color, clean through the window. They can hear the
          ARCHER SCREAMING inside and see the colored light still
          flaring from the window.

          BOY.
          Oh Papa!

          MAN.
          Stay just like you are.
          He gets up and runs limping across the street, the arrow 
          still embedded in his leg.

          INT. WOODEN STAIRS - EVENING

          He limps up the stairs of the old warehouse as quickly as he
          can, flare gun at the ready, arrow in his leg.

          INT. WAREHOUSE FLOOR - EVENING

          He bursts into the main room and trains the gun. At the far
          end a WOMAN is sitting with the prone form of the ARCHER. The
          floor is burnt in a huge patch left by the flare and is still
          in flames.

          ARCHER'S WOMAN.
          You son of a bitch! 

          MAN.
          Who else is up here?

          ARCHER'S WOMAN.
          You fucking asshole! 
          The MAN looks down, his leg is bleeding heavily now and the
          arrow is still sticking out.

          MAN.
          Where's the bow?

          ARCHER'S WOMAN.
          I don't have it.

          MAN.
          Why are you following us?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         CONTINUED:

          ARCHER'S WOMAN.
          We're not following anybody. You
          were following us!
          The MAN stares at the WOMAN, looking her up and down, she
          looks sick and thin and desperate. He looks at the ARCHER,
          lying there dead, his chest and one arm and his face burnt,
          still smoking. The WOMAN covers his face with the blanket and
          the MAN doesn't know what to say, ashamed. He goes.

          EXT. CAFE - DAY 

           POV - again from a distance, as if a third party is watching,
           we watch the BOY and the MAN hobble into a CAFE. 

          INT. CAFE - DAY 

          One wall of the CAFE is merely a pile of rubble, opening out
          to the sea. The opposite wall is a photographic mural of lush
          green woods. The MAN tries to pull the arrow out but just
          pulls the wooden stem out. He takes off his bloodied trousers
          and examines the gaping wound with a flap of flesh and the
          arrow head, made from a SPOON, buried inside.

          MAN.
          See if you can find the medical kit
          from the boat. Quickly.
          The BOY rummages in the trolley, finds the kit and hands it
          over. He stares as the MAN slowly extracts the spoon, wincing
          in agony. The MAN dowses the wound in antiseptic from the kit
          and searches through the kit for a needle. He finds a suture
          needle in a sterile envelope, rips it open with his teeth
          and, using the light coming in through the parlour windows he
          threads some silk thread into the needle. He starts to suture
          up the wound, grimacing in pain as the BOY watches in
          silence, until eventually offering:

                         BOY
          Does it hurt?
          The MAN just looks at him in disbelief - beat.

          MAN. 
          Yes! It hurts!

          BOY.
          What does it feel like?
          The MAN eyes the BOY, amazed at this inopportune chat. 

                         (CONTINUED)

          MAN.
          At least you're talking to me now.

          INT./EXT. CAFE - (CAMP 17) - NIGHT 

           They have a campfire in the cafe by the jetty and sit 
           overlooking the bay, through the missing wall, silent until: 

          MAN.
          Do you want me to tell you a story?

          BOY.
          No.

          MAN.
          Why not?

          BOY.
          Your stories aren't true.

          MAN.
          They don't have to be true. They're
          stories.

          BOY.
          In the stories we're always helping
          people. But we don't help people.
          We just shoot people. And in the
          stories good things happen but we
          just get sick.
          The MAN thinks about it - stuck for an answer. 

          MAN.
          We're still here aren't we? Doesn't
          that mean anything?

          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH - DAY 

          The MAN pulls the trolley slowly, finding it a great effort.
          The BOY helps pull, eying the MAN with concern. The MAN stops
          and rests on the trolley and the BOY pulls on a few more feet
          then stops and looks back as the MAN COUGHS for a long
          painful moment. He takes the bloodstained surgical mask from
          his face, his breath foggy in the cold, he wrings out the
          blood and saliva, puts his head between his knees and coughs
          until he can cough no more, gasping for breathe, bloody drool
          unspooling from his lips into the sand like scarlet twine
          while the BOY watches, weeping silently.

          MAN.
          We have to leave the cart. I can't
          push it anymore.

          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH - DAY

          They are trudging along a concrete boat ramp by the beach
          road, the beach below, the BOY carrying a small-suitcase now,
          the MAN carrying sacks and bags. They stop and the MAN leans,
          impossibly breathless, his lungs packing up. They stop at the
          water edge, where the road reaches the sea.
          The BOY takes his hand gently.

          BOY.
          What are we going to do Papa?
          The MAN can't answer for breathlessness.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Well, what are we?
          The MAN sits heavily on the ground, totters as the BOY stands 
          watching him, eyes welling with tears.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Oh no, Papa.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES -(CAMP 18) - DAY 

          The MAN is drifting in and out of consciousness in the sand.
          The BOY comes over with a cup of water and holds it to the
          MAN's lips, he drinks. The BOY has also lit a fire. He
          spreads out blankets.

          MAN.
          Don't get comfortable. You need to
          keep going. You don't know what
          might be down the road.

          BOY.
          No.

          MAN.
          We were always lucky. You'll be
          lucky again. You'll see. Just go.

          it.

          me.

          MAN.
          I know. I'm sorry.

          105.

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          The MAN closes his eyes and takes deep, rattling breaths.

          BOY.
          It's okay Papa. You don't have to
          talk anymore.
          Camera pulls back and the BOY is sitting with the MAN saying
          nothing. It's starting to grow dark. The BOY crouches down on
          the MAN's chest and goes to sleep there, rising and falling
          with his father's breathing.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES (CAMP 18) - NIGHT

          Darkness all around, the BOY is lying across the MAN, his
          hand rising and falling on the MAN's chest slowly,
          irregularly as the MAN's breath rattles in his lungs.

          EXT. CAR/BEACH - DAWN 

          FLASHBACK - or the MAN'S last ever dream: The MAN and the
          WOMAN snooze in the car - an ordinary young couple nestled
          together in the early morning sun light. The MAN wakes and
          looks at his sleeping wife, smooths her hair tenderly, very
          much in love, as she sleeps.
           His hand on her wakes her, she looks at him surprised and 
          pleased, smiles. 

           WOMAN.
           Hello...
           She kisses him and they look at the blue ocean and the white 
           sand and green sea grass and she puts an arm around him. 

           MAN. (V.O.)
           If I were God I would have made the
           world just so and no different...
           And so I have you. .I have you.

          END OF FLASHBACK. 

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) MORNING 

          The BOY is awake but doesn't move, his hand still on the
          MAN's chest, now motionless. He looks at the MAN who is cold
          and stiff now, long dead. The BOY gets up and holds the MAN's
          cold stiff hand. Tears course down his face silently.

          BOY.
          Oh Papa. Papa. Papa...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) NIGHT

          The BOY is building a campfire. He lights it and sits there
          watching the MAN's motionless body.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES -(CAMP 19) MORNING 

          The BOY has slept beside the MAN, he wakes, blinks,
          bewildered.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) - DAY 

          The BOY is zipping up the MAN's parka carefully and heaping
          blankets on top, talking all the while.

          BOY.
          Can I tell you something? I had a
          bad dream. I had this penguin that
          you wound up and it would waddle
          and flap its flippers. And we were
          in that house we used to live in
          and it came around the corner but
          nobody had wound it up and it was
          really scary because-because-
          because...
          He goes quiet as he finishes tending to the body and puts his
          own parka on, zips it up.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          The winder wasn't turning.
           He takes the gun, checks the magazine, shuts it and stands, 
          shoving the pistol in his belt.

          EXT. WATER'S EDGE, BOAT LAUNCH - DAY 

          The BOY is standing at the water's edge looking out at the
          smog and the emptiness. Out of nowhere a man in a gray and
          red ski parka with the hood up appears carrying a shotgun
          over his shoulder and a belt of shells.
          He goes over to the BOY, he is the same bearded and scarred 
          man seen earlier, watching them in the sand dunes. The BOY 
          doesn't flinch, but his hand goes to the gun at his side.
          When the man speaks he has some sort of speech defect,
          possibly caused by missing teeth.

          VETERAN.
          Where's the man you were with? (NO
          REPLY.) Was he your father?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY.
          Yes. He was my Papa.

          VETERAN.
          I'm sorry.

          BOY.
          I don't know what to do.

          VETERAN.
          Well, I think maybe you should come
          with me.
          The BOY's finger tightens on the trigger of the GUN.

          BOY.
          Are you one of the good guys?

          VETERAN.
          Yeah. I'm one of the good guys. Why
          don't you put that pistol away?

          BOY.
          I'm not supposed to let anybody
          take the pistol. No matter what.

          VETERAN.
          I don't want your pistol. I just
          didn't want you pointing it at me.
          The BOY lowers the gun to his side and the VETERAN comes a
          few steps closer, causing the BOY to back up a step.

          VETERAN. (CONT'D)
          Where's your stuff?

          BOY.
          I don't have much stuff.

          VETERAN.
          What have you got? Blankets?

          BOY.
          My Papa's wrapped in them.

          MAN.
          Show me.
          The BOY doesn't move. The MAN holds out his hand for the BOY
          to take, the BOY sees he has a THUMB MISSING and hesitates,
          wary. The MAN squats, leaning on his shotgun.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

          VETERAN.
          Look. You got two choices here. You
          can stay here with your papa or you
          can go with me. If you stay you
          need to keep off the road.

          BOY.
          How do I know you're one of the
          good guys?

          VETERAN.
          You don't. You'll have to take a
          shot.
          The BOY weighs it up, eyeing the VETERAN.

          BOY.
          Do you have any kids?

          VETERAN.
          Yes we do.

          BOY.
          Do you have a little boy?

          VETERAN.
          We have a little boy and a little
          girl.

          BOY.
          How old is he?

          VETERAN.
          He's about your age. Maybe a little
          older.

          BOY.
          And you didn't eat them?

          VETERAN.
          No.

          BOY.
          You don't eat people?

          VETERAN.
          No. We don't eat people.

          BOY.
          Are you carrying the fire?

                         (CONTINUED)

          VETERAN.
          Am I what?

          BOY.
          Carrying the fire.

          VETERAN.
          You're kind of weirded out, aren't
          you, kid?

          BOY.
          Well, are you?

          VETERAN.
          Yeah. I am. I'm carrying the fire.

          BOY.
          And I can go with you?

          VETERAN.
          Yes, you can.
          The BOY hesitates.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - DAY

          They go over to where the MAN lies dead and the VETERAN
          squats and lifts a blanket to take a look.

          VETERAN.
          Are these all the blankets you
          have?

          BOY.
          Yes.

          VETERAN.
          Is that your suitcase?

          BOY.
          Yes.
          The VETERAN stands and studies the BOY.

          VETERAN.
          Why don't you go up onto the road
          and wait for me. I'll bring the
          blankets.

          BOY.
          What about my Papa?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         CONTINUED:

          VETERAN.
          What about him?

          BOY.
          We can't just leave him here.

          VETERAN.
          Yes we can.

          BOY.
          I don't want people to see him.

          VETERAN.
          There's nobody to see him.

          BOY.
          Can I cover him in leaves?

          VETERAN.
          The wind will blow them away.

          BOY.
          Could we cover him with one of the
          blankets?

          VETERAN.
          Okay. I'll do it. Go on now.

          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH, ROAD - DAY

          The BOY waits and in a moment the VETERAN emerges from the
          dunes carrying the suitcase with the blankets slung over his
          shoulder. He sorts through them and hands one to the BOY.

          VETERAN.
          Here. Wrap this around you. You're
          cold.
          The BOY eye the blanket uncertainly, holds out the pistol for
          the VETERAN to hold.

          VETERAN. (CONT'D)
          You hold onto that.

          BOY.
          Okay.

          VETERAN.
          Do you know how to shoot it?

          BOY.
          Yes.

                         CONTINUED:

          VETERAN.
          Okay.

          BOY.
          What about my papa?

          VETERAN.
          There's nothing else to be done.

          BOY.
          I think I want to say goodbye to
          him.

          VETERAN.
          Will you be all right?

          BOY.
          Yes.

          VETERAN.
          Go ahead. I'll wait here for you.
          The BOY turns around and heads down to the beach.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) - DAY

          The BOY trudges through the sand over to the corpse of the
          MAN which is now neatly wrapped up in a blanket from head to
          toe. The BOY kneels beside him and starts to cry silently and
          whisper.

          BOY.
          I'll talk to you every day. And I
          won't forget. No matter what. No
          matter what, Papa.
          The BOY dries his eyes, takes a breath, gets up and walks
          back to the road...

          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH, ROAD- DAY 

          As the BOY walks out of the dunes holding the gun, a MOTHERLY
          WOMAN who is standing with the VETERAN comes towards him.

          MOTHERLY WOMAN.
          Oh. I am so glad to see you.
          The BOY just stares at her, bemused - a short distance away
          stands the rest of the family - a BOY his age and a GIRL. The
          BOY stares at the OTHER BOY and recognizes him - it's the
          same BOY he chased earlier.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         CONTINUED:
          Then the BOY notices a threadbare mongrel of a DOG, waiting
          with them.
          The MOTHERLY WOMAN goes over and puts her arms around him.

          MOTHERLY WOMAN. (CONT'D)
          We've been following you. Did you
          know that? We saw you with your
          Papa and we tried to catch up but
          you were too quick for us.

          VETERAN.
          There was some discussion about
          whether to even come after you at
          all.

          As she's chatting, the MOTHERLY WOMAN gently takes the gun
          from the BOY and hands it to the VETERAN.

          MOTHERLY WOMAN.
          We're so lucky. We were so worried
          about you. And now we don't have to
          worry about a thing.
          She kisses the BOY on the forehead and holds him at arm's
          length and looks at him.

          MOTHERLY WOMAN. (CONT'D)
          How does that sound? Is that okay?
          He stares but says nothing...

                      PRINCE OF THIEVES

FADE IN:

SUNSET
The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.

BLACK, ROBED FIGURE
A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened,
almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES
across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer.
Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of
minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to
their devotions.

EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET
Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping
water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.
Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two
crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER
DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.

INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET

A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained
victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two
white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
Peter, jabbering in Arabic.
                         INTERROGATOR
           He says you stole his bread.
                         PETER
           It is a lie. I caught him
           stealing ours.
The lowlife jabbers some more.    The Interrogator debates.
                         INTERROGATOR
           Cut off the infidel's hand.
The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                      2.
CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
         No!... I took the bread.
                       PETER
         That's not true.
                       ROBIN
         They're not interested in truth.
         You are too weak, Peter. You
         would not live through it.
The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
                       INTERROGATOR
         Sacrifice for the weaker? How
         noble... As you wish... Cut off
         this one's hand as well!... But
         first...
He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
                       INTERROGATOR
         Show them the courage of Allah.
The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot
scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.
Twitching.
Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his
knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers
unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,
forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter
catches his eye... Robin winks.
The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.
Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.
                       ROBIN
         And this is English courage.
He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his
fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.
Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at
him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.
Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the
furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the
fire. Screaming.
                       PETER
         That's for five years of hell.

A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.
                         VOICE (O.S.)
         Behind you!
Warned, Robin ducks away.    Slams the jailer's head into
the wall.
Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted
the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.
Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even
his bald head is ornamented.
                       ROBIN
         You speak English?
                       SARACEN
         The king's own. Set me free.
                         PETER
         No, Robin.
                       SARACEN
         For pity's sake. Mine is a
         sentence of death.
Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
                       PETER
         Don't trust him.
Two more guards attack, yelling fury.    Robin eyes the
curved scimitar.
                       ROBIN
         What I would give for an English
         sword. This is a pruning hook.
A guard swings at him with a giant axe.    Robin slashes...
shears the axe handle in two.
                        ROBIN
         Hmm!   Not bad.
He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His
opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from
the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.
Commotion outside.    RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
                       SARACEN
         Free me and I will show you a way
         out.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                       ROBIN
         Why should we trust you?
                       SARACEN
         If you don't, you are dead men.
                       ROBIN
         He makes a point.
The door bursts open.    More guards rush in.
                         ROBIN
         A good point.
He slashes the man free.

                         PETER
         Robin!
                       ROBIN
         Whatever blood is in his veins, he
         does not deserve to die here.
                         SARACEN
         This way!
He beckons them to the back.     A hidden door leads into a
tunnel.

INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
They wade through foul water up to their waists. The
Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin
lops off its head.

                       SARACEN
         You are fast, my friend.
                       ROBIN
         Five years I've waited for the
         smell of free air. That makes a
         man fast.
Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blocking
the way.
                       SARACEN
         You will need to be yet faster.
A narrow opening to their left... they splash through.
Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire
arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.
                                             (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
                        SARACEN
         Poison air.   Hold your breath.
Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass
of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on
him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen
intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it
with one mighty twist.
                       PETER
                (coughing)
         Thanks. I misjudged you.
                       SARACEN
         Save your breath.

Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they
slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
walls ahead.
Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.
They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,
bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it
works.
                       SARACEN
         Allah be praised.
                       ROBIN
         Amen, brother.
A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down
the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against
the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the
spikes.
A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using
the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a
grating.

EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT
Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of
mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.
All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps
Peter up.
                       ROBIN
         God willing, we may now be safe.
                                            (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired
from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under
the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers
approaching.
                         ROBIN
         Come, Peter.    We must hurry.
Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
                         PETER
         It is mortal.    Leave me.
                       ROBIN
         Hold on to my shoulder.

Peter shakes him off.
                       PETER
         My mother... my little sister.
         Tell them I love them. Tell them
         I died a free Englishman.
Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.
                       SARACEN
         His wound is by the heart.    We
         cannot save him.
Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from
a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's
hand.
                       PETER
         Take this to my sister. Swear you
         will protect her for me... Swear
         it, Robin!
                       ROBIN
                (reluctantly)
         I swear it.
Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at
the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
                         PETER
         For England.
He fells the first Arab.   The Saracen pulls Robin away.
                       SARACEN
         Come now! Do not fail your friend.
         Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos-
sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.

                                                         7.
DESERTED ALLEY - LATER
Robin and the Saracen catch their breath.
                          ROBIN
            Farewell, friend. God speed you
            on your way.
                          SARACEN
            Our way is together. With the
            speed of Allah.
He grins.    This strange man has a sense of humor.
                          ROBIN
            I go to England.

                          SARACEN
            Then I go to England.
                           ROBIN
            England?   Why?
                          SARACEN
            You saved my life. I must stay
            with you until I save yours.
                          ROBIN
            Go your own way. I relieve you of
            your obligation.
                          SARACEN
            Only Allah can do that.
                          ROBIN
            And if I don't want you?
                          SARACEN
            You have no choice... unless you
            think you can kill me.
He grins broadly.      Offers his hand.
                          SARACEN
            My name is Aslan.
Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand.
                          ROBIN
            Robin of Locksley. You know a
            short route to England, Aslan?

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND)
Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon
reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded
in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.
SUPERIMPOSE:   LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND

INT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep
hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A
bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
                       VOICE (O.S.)
         Enough of that din, Remus.    I
         can't think.
Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-
tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD
LOCKSLEY.
Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a
wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for
solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast
table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a
portrait over the fireplace... Robin.
The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley
unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the
Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged,
desperate, KENNETH.
                        KENNETH
         My Lord!   Help me.
He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him
from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN.
Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth
back.
                       DUNCAN
         You must wait... I am sorry you
         were disturbed, Master.
                       KENNETH
                (high anxiety)
         My Lord, please!
                       LOCKSLEY
         It is alright, Duncan.
                (to Kenneth)
         You are Kenneth of Cowfall?
The peasant falls to his knees.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                       KENNETH
         They've taken my Gwen.    My
         daughter.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Who has taken her?
                       KENNETH
         Men on horses. In masks.
                (touches his wound)
         We tried to stop them. My son is
         dead.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT

Steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord
Locksley mounts, in armor. Duncan attempts to detain
him.
                       DUNCAN
         You cannot go alone, Master.      Let
         me ride for help.
                       LOCKSLEY
         That may be too late. Kenneth,
         lead the way.
He kicks his horse into motion.
                         DUNCAN
         Master, stay!    There is an evil
         moon tonight.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Good will overcome, Duncan.      Trust
         in that.
Duncan looks up.    Crosses himself.    Dark clouds race
across the moon.

EXT. WOODED TRAIL
Kenneth checks the ground.    Locksley waits.
                       KENNETH
         They came this way, my Lord.
                         LOCKSLEY
         Onward then.    What is this place?
                                              (CONTINUED)

                       KENNETH
         Nearby the Gregor Caves.
Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on...
Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley
ties his nervous horse to a tree.
Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.
He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting
female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.

                       LOCKSLEY
         Steady, man. They are to dissuade
         the faint of heart. Think of
         Gwen.
From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a
circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.
A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose
robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.
Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.
                       KENNETH
         Druids.
                       LOCKSLEY
         I trusted we were rid of such evil
         a century ago.

An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle
of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its
clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood.
The reveler is ecstatic.
                       KENNETH
                (petrified)
         Is it the devil?
                       LOCKSLEY
         If it is, I have some Christian
         steel that will test his hide.
He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt.
A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his
head.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                      11.
CONTINUED:
                       LOCKSLEY
         Gwen?
Kenneth nods.
The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who  is
carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan   altar,
the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. A
masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   The high
priest of the dark rite.
The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.
                       DEMON
         Come, my virgin flower.
Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of
sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The
first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The
Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd
of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation...
A warrior's yell!
Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The
terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.
                        DEMON
         Kill him!   Kill him!
The followers throw themselves at   Locksley. He beats
them off. The high priest issues    orders to armed guards,
who run to intercept. One aims a    spear. Locksley hacks
the shaft in half. Cuts men down    left and right.
Reaches the altar stone.
                        LOCKSLEY
         Gwen!   Up, girl, up!
Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at
Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his
strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.
                       LOCKSLEY
         In the name of God!
His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the
gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face...
Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                    12.
CONTINUED:
The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls
the girl onto his charger. The guards close in.
Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening.
The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked.
Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown.
Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the
cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in
recognition.


                        LOCKSLEY
         Nottingham!
The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard,
cruel intensity in every feature.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You are an unwelcome surprise,
         Locksley.
                       LOCKSLEY
         The King shall hear of this,
         Nottingham.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         I think not.
Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their
faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.

                        LOCKSELY
         God help us.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         One day all England will worship
         with us.
                        LOCKSLEY
         Never.
The crone spits venom in his face.
                       DEMON
         I am Mortianna. You will die with
         my name on your lips.
Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill-
side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five
masked figures block his way.

                                                         13.
EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAY
A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor.    A cross on
its sail.
A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in
a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching
land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades
to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face
into the soil.
                         ROBIN
         Home.    Thank you, Lord.
Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French
sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his
hand.

                       ROBIN
         My friend, you have escorted me
         home. I beg you to free yourself
         of your vow. Return with the
         boat. I know how heavy your
         heart must be, this far from your
         family and native land...
                       ASLAN (SARACEN)
         Because I love them so dearly,
         I cannot dishonor them.
A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.
                       ROBIN
         I thought you'd say that.
He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The
Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him
into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.

                       ASLAN
         No man controls my destiny.
         Especially not one who attacks
         downwind and stinks of garlic.
Robin laughs.    The Saracen remains intense.
                       ASLAN
         If our positions were reversed,
         I would have done the same.
         Only I would have succeeded.
He smiles broadly.    Robin claps him on the shoulder.
                       ROBIN
         Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will
         celebrate your honor when we dine
         with my father.

                                                    14.
EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAY
CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's
hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at
them, laughing.
Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot,
with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
Searching.
GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback.
Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony.
He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
arms, FANNY.
                       GISBORNE
         You owe the sheriff three bushels
         of flax.
                       FANNY
         You starve us. First the drought,
         now you take what food we have
         left.
                       GISBORNE
         For starving people, you look
         fat enough.
                       SOLDIER
                (emerging from
                 the hut)
         He's not here, sir. None but the
         woman and children.
                       GISBORNE
                (to Fanny)
         Where is your mate? The man
         they call Little.
                       FANNY
         He died last winter.
                       GISBORNE
         Is that so? We hear he     is very
         much alive. Hiding out     in the
         forest. He probably ran     away
         to escape your scolding    tongue.
The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny
pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
                         FANNY
         Norman swine!
A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at
Gisborne's throat.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                        15.
CONTINUED:
                       FANNY
         No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only
         make it worse.
Wulf backs off.   Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
                        GISBORNE
         Seize him!
While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his
hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the
side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
                       GISBORNE
         This is Lord Nottingham's deer.
         Is this how you repay the Sheriff
         for his protection?
                       WULF (BOY)
         Like a wolf protects sheep.
                        FANNY
         I killed it.   We needed the meat.
                       GISBORNE
         Poachers hang. Either he dies or
         you die.
                       WULF
         My mother lies to protect me.
                        FANNY
         No, Wulf!
Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.

                       GISBORNE
         You have deprived us of a hunt,
         boy.
He cups his hand in the deer's blood.    Smears it on
Wulf's face.
                       GISBORNE
         The hounds know the scent well.
He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at
each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
                       GISBORNE
         Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us
         some pleasure before you die.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       16.
CONTINUED:
To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and
the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.
                         GISBORNE
         Unleash them!

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
Nearing home, Robin is buoyant.     The Saracen, brooding,
walks two paces behind him.
                       ROBIN
         Why must you walk in back of me?

                       ASLAN
         In your land am I not the infidel?
         The unbeliever, the instrument of
         evil?
                       ROBIN
         Our races have fought for a
         hundred years to prove that point.
                       ASLAN
         Then I trust it is safer to appear
         as your slave than as your equal.
                       ROBIN
         For an 'infidel' you have uncommon
         clarity of thinking. Yet you
         refuse to tell me about your home
         and family.
                       ASLAN
         Those are my burdens.

                       ROBIN
         You speak my language. You have
         the diplomacy and honor code of
         a nobleman. I ask again, why
         were you to be executed?
The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
                       ROBIN
         So, I must continue with my
         guesswork. You are highborn?
         Probably... You fell from favor...
         Clearly... Why? You broke the
         law? You were a rival for power?
         ... A woman?
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        17.
CONTINUED:
The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
                          ROBIN
            By the Lord, that's it!
Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
                          ROBIN
            They say there are Arab women of
            such beauty that they can possess
            a man's mind, that he would be
            willing to die for them. Is
            that not so?
Ignoring him, the Saracen stops.      Examines the darkening
sky.
                          ASLAN
            It is close to sunset.
                          ROBIN
            Your people must marry women
            chosen for them by others, right?
No reply.    Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
                          ROBIN
            Who is she? The Mullah's daughter?
            ... Another man's wife?... That's
            it!
                          ASLAN
            Endless clouds. Is there no sun
            in your cursed country?
                          ROBIN
            You dog! You painted old dog!
            What is her name?
                          ASLAN
            Which way is East?
                         ROBIN
            Her name?
                         ASLAN
            East?
                         ROBIN
            Her name?
                         ASLAN
            East?!!!
Robin folds his arms.    A standoff.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                       18.

                       ASLAN
         Damn you!... Jasmina.
                         ROBIN
         Ah, Jasmina!    Is she beautiful?
                       ASLAN
         Which way is East?
                         ROBIN
         That way.
Aslan throws his rug on the ground.    Kneels.
                         ASLAN
         Are you sure?
                       ROBIN
         I would know blindfolded. I'm
         five miles from home... Was she
         worth it?
                       ASLAN
         Worth dying for.
Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his
prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the
boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs
the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close
in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the
branches. A hound savages his leg.
The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers
precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep-
titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers'
horses.

                       GISBORNE
         You're not playing by    the rules,
         boy. Deer don't climb     trees...
         Perhaps he thinks he's    a game
         bird. Shall we teach     him to fly?
         Cut it down!
The soldiers hack at the trunk.    The tree quivers.
                       ROBIN
         Hold!... I am curious as to what
         manner of creature is so fearsome
         that it takes six men to attack
         it.
Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches
them.

                                                      19.
CONTINUED:
                       GISBORNE
         Stand back, stranger. This is no
         affair of yours.
                       ROBIN
         Have we treed the devil himself?
         Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy.
         A truly dangerous animal.
                       GISBORNE
         I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
         This is the Sheriff's land.
                       ROBIN
         Wrong. This is my land, and my
         tree. Therefore, whatever is in
         it also belongs to me.
                       GISBORNE
         I grow dangerously tired of your
         wit... Chop it down!
                       ROBIN
         The man who strikes that tree
         dies.
He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his
prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised
than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
                       GISBORNE
         Chop down the hooded fool.
                       ROBIN
                (backing up)
         Perhaps we could discuss this.

The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape...
the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds
through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.
                       GISBORNE
         Kill him!
                        ROBIN
         Aslan!   It's time to redeem that
         vow.
                       GISBORNE
         Set the dogs on him!
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        20.
CONTINUED:
Aslan ignores him, lost in his   prayers. Robin lifts the
other arm -- a second concealed   crossbow. WHUMPF! The
bolt flips the dog handler into   the vicious pack. Dead
or not, he soon will be. Robin    unsheathes his sword.
                          ROBIN
            Aslan, get off your damn knees!
            I have four of them cornered.
The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal
a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of
flashing steel.
                          ROBIN
            I hope there's enough of me to
            satisfy you all.
Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out.
Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword
strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth
onto a sharp tree stump.
Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly.       Blood flows
from his arm. His sword falls.
                         ROBIN
            Aslan!!
Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.      Robin
freezes.
                          GISBORNE
            Well, hooded stranger, allow me
            to know your name before I run you
            through.

A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins,
kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's
sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his
pilgrim's hood.
                          GISBORNE
            Robin of Locksley!
                          ROBIN
            On your knees, Gisborne.   Pray.
He obeys.    Robin raises his sword.
                          GISBORNE
            Please, Locksley! No!
Robin drives the point into Gisborne's rear.      The man
leaps.

                       ROBIN
         Now get off my land. And tell your
         cousin the Sheriff what happens to
         his scum when they pick on my
         people.
Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his
rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab.
Keeps running.
                       ROBIN
                (to Aslan,
                 furious)
         You worthless savage! You travel
         ten thousand miles to save my life,
         then leave me to be butchered.
                       ASLAN
         I will fulfill my vow when I
         choose.
                       ROBIN
         Which does not include prayer
         times, meal times, or any time
         I'm outnumbered six to one!!
                       ASLAN
         You whine like a mule.   You are
         still alive.
                       ROBIN
         Barely.
Aslan examines Robin's wound.   Dismissive.
                       ASLAN
         A flesh wound. Why did you let
         their leader go?
                       ROBIN
         After six years of the stench of
         death, I have no stomach for
         needless blood on my hands.
Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
                       ROBIN
         Have no fear, boy.
The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering
a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.
                       ASLAN
                (laughing)
         The conquering hero returns.

                        ROBIN
         Ha!   It was you he was scared of.
Aslan's humor is infectious.     Robin's anger relents.
                       ROBIN
         Come, my strange friend. Beyond
         that hill lies the prettiest
         little castle in all Christendom.
         Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
                       ASLAN
         With feather pillows?
                       ROBIN
         With feather pillows. Warm and
         soft like Jasmina's embrace.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud
castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted.
Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck
dumb with horror.
The dark courtyard.   Heartsick, Robin stumbles over
debris.
                         ROBIN
         Father!    Hello!
His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan
places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended
high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.


CLOSE - MEDALLION
round the corpse's neck.   The Locksley crest.
                        ROBIN
         Noooooo!
A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture.
Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained,
Aslan looks on.
                       ROBIN
         I should have been here.
Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they
hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A
hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff
... Duncan.

                       DUNCAN
         Master Robin, is it you? A
         miracle. I thought God had
         abandoned us.
                       ROBIN
         You left my father to hang like
         a common thief, carrion for the
         crows.

                       ASLAN
         Easy... Look at him.
Duncan steps into the moonlight.    His face crudely-
scarred.
                       ROBIN
         What has happened?
                       DUNCAN
         They say they captured him
         worshipping with the Druids. He
         signed a confession before the
         Bishop of Hereford.
                       ROBIN
         Did they have witnesses?
                       DUNCAN
         Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall.
         The Bishop decreed all the Locksley
         lands forfeit.
                       ROBIN
         Did you believe the charges?
                       DUNCAN
         Not even when they took my eyes.
                       ROBIN
         Who did this to you, Duncan?
                       DUNCAN
         Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff
         looking on.
Robin holds the old retainer to his chest.    Stares into
the night in silent rage.

                                                         24.
EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
Marked contrast.   A forbidding fortress.   Cliff-like
battlements.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
Face like thunder, Guy of Gisborne strides up curving,
stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak
door.
                       SENTRY
         Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to
         be disturbed.
                        GISBORNE
         Away, fool.
He shoves the Sentry aside.

EXT. CASTLE BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT
Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty
in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis-
tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his
feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she
covers up.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Who bade you cover up?
He smashes his fist into his chair.   She timidly
uncovers.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Cousin, I trust you justify your
         intrusion with news of profound
         value.
His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of
the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black-
ness.
                       GISBORNE
         I met a hooded man today. He bade
         me warn you not to harm his
         people.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         His name?
                       GISBORNE
         Robin of Locksley.

                      NOTTINGHAM
         Ha! The prodigal son returns. He
         is a whelp. This girl could best
         him.
                       GISBORNE
         This whelp bested five of my men
         in the blink of an eye.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Your men were probably drunk.   Yet
         you survived, cousin?
Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a
child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud
CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW,
wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think
she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible
agility. MORTIANNA.
                       GISBORNE
                (stunned)
         You brought her here?
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Quiet!
The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a
writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes.
Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter.
The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con-
tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone
dice -- Runes.
She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in
trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses
out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every
move. A connoisseur.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What do you see?
                       MORTIANNA
         Change the seat of power.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         London?
                       MORTIANNA
         Change it.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Move the capitol to Nottingham?
         Excellent. How?
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                           26.

         Ally with royal blood.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Put someone on the throne and rule
         through him? Who?
                       MORTIANNA
         That is not revealed.
The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind.      Mounting
intensity.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Ally with royal blood. What else
         do you see?
                         MORTIANNA
         Armies.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Whose?
                      MORTIANNA
         Yours. Men and weaponry in great
         numgers.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         And victory?
                       MORTIANNA
         Much blood will be spilled.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Whose?


CLOSE SHOT
A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol.
Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands
again. Again the grinning skull.

BACK TO SCENE
The tray smashes to the ground.      The hag runs at
Gisborne.
                       MORTIANNA
         Who have you seen?!
She shakes him.    Screams spittle in his face.

                       GISBORNE
                (freaked)
         No one. I have seen no one.
                          MORTIANNA
         You lie!     A man... A painted man.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What is wrong?
                       MORTIANNA
         I have seen my death.
She whimpers.   Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.

                       MORTIANNA
         The painted man. He haunts my
         dreams.
                       GISBORNE
         Locksley has a companion. A dark-
         skinned foreigner. He had the
         marked skin of Islam.
Mortianna trembles like an epileptic.    Eyes wide with
terror.
                          MORTIANNA
         Kill them!     Kill them!
She throws herself at Nottingham for protection.    He
caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Cousin. Prove to Locksley that
         your survival was his last mistake.

                       MORTIANNA
                (frantic)
         And the painted man! Kill him.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Kill them both.
He continues to stroke her.    Her trembling subsides.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You have done well, Mortianna.
         Exceedingly well. No one shall
         harm you, I swear it.
Mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young
girl, who shrinks away. Nottingham gently takes the
girl's hand.

Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down
viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses
         will seem soft, like an angel's.
                (to Mortianna)
         Take her. You have earned her.
Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist.   Drags her
away.
                       GISBORNE
         It is madness bringing the hag
         here.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For
         in madness, there is great power.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - DAWN
Red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees.
Robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave.
Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side.
                       ROBIN
         Our last words in this world were
         spoken in anger. He called the
         Crusades a foolish quest, said it
         was vanity to force other men to
         our religion. He was right.
                (looks to Aslan,
                 then back to the
                 grave)
         Please forgive me, Father.
                       DUNCAN
         He loved you till the end, young
         master. He never gave up hope of
         your return.
                       ROBIN
         I failed him. I should have been
         here at his side.
                       DUNCAN
         You must leave, head north to
         safety. Gisborne will surely seek
         revenge.
                       ROBIN
         Leave me.

         I know what you're thinking. But
         one man can achieve nothing
         against so many. You would need
         an army.
                         ROBIN
         Leave me.
                         ASLAN
         Come, friend.
He leads the old man away.
                                           CUT TO:


GRAVE SIDE - LATER
Pouring rain. Robin stands drenched at the grave side.
Aslan watches from the shelter of trees. Duncan heats a
stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire.
                       DUNCAN
         He still stands vigil?
                         ASLAN
         Like a rock.
Duncan offers half the bread to the Saracen.
                       DUNCAN
         A curse on the Saracens! Were it
         not for their ungodly ways, he
         would never have left. This would
         never have happened.

                       ASLAN
         It surprises me that one who
         curses others so readily has lived
         so long.
                       DUNCAN
         I do not recognize the style of
         your voice, friend. Are you
         Irish? A Cornishman?
                         ASLAN
         Er... no.
                       DUNCAN
         What manner of name is Aslan then?
                       ASLAN
         A fine Saracen name.

         Lord, no!
He chokes in shock.   Spitting bread.

         Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I
         take no offense.
                (glances at Robin)
         By the prophet! What is the man
         doing?
Robin raises his dagger over his wrist.   Aslan runs to
him.

                         ASLAN
         Wait!
Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm.
Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave.
                       ROBIN
         I swear by my own blood. I will
         not rest until I have restored my
         father's name.
                (a whisper)
         ... Or until I am dead.

EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY
Ooze sucks at feet.   The three men stomp through mud and
rain.
                       ROBIN
         We make a fine army, do we not,
         Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and
         a fool.
                       ASLAN
         A fine, wet army. I have never
         witnessed a storm of such duration.
         When does summer come to this
         land?
                       ROBIN
         This is summer.

           No food, no shelter,   and weather

           earth. We  will all   quickly be
           dead, and I shall be   rid of my
           vow.
They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched
mansion.
                         ROBIN
           You despair too soon, Aslan. We
           shall find food and shelter here
           among friends.

                         ASLAN
           What is this place?
                         ROBIN
           Peter's home. It is nearly seven
           years since we left here together.

EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
Robin pounds on the door.    A hatch opens.     An OLD WOMAN's
face.
                         OLD WOMAN
           No beggars!
The hatch slams shut.    Robin pounds again.
                         ROBIN
           Open up!

A pause.   The hatch slides back.
                         ROBIN
           Tell the mistress of the house
           that Robin of Locksley is at her
           door.
                         OLD WOMAN
           Her ladyship is not at home.
She slams the hatch again.    Robin jams in his hand.
                         ROBIN
           Aagh!
He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.

            Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't.
            Remove that hand.
Robin refuses. She waits imperiously behind the locked
door. Robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. Instantly
the hatch slams.
                          ASLAN
            The hospitality here is as warm as
            the weather.

They wait, shivering... The door opens a crack.
                          OLD WOMAN
            Leave your weapons.
The three start forward.       Her bony finger points at
Robin.
                            OLD WOMAN
            Just you.

He waits.    CREAKING FOOTSTEPS on the balcony.

            Who are you?
Dim lighting.    Robin cannot make out who it is.

         I am the maid Marian.
                       ROBIN
         Then show yourself, child.     For we
         knew each other well.
                       GIRL
         With the king away, these are
         lawless times. There are outlaws
         villainous enough to kidnap and
         ransom a relative of his.
                       ROBIN
         You know I am not one of them.
         Besides, I am sworn to protect
         you.
                       GIRL
                (laughs)
         Protect me? Robin of Locksley was
         nothing but a spoiled bully.
                       ROBIN
         Allow that years of war and prison
         may change a man. Step forward,
         Marian, so I may see how you have
         changed.

She moves into the light... Fat.     Rotten teeth.   Ugly as
sin.
                       ROBIN
         Er... the years have been kind.
                       GIRL
         Thank you. Now remove yourself
         from this household.
A figure steps behind Robin.    Sticks a sword in his back.
                       GIRL
                (turning away)
         As you can see, we are already
         well protected.
                         ROBIN
         Wait, Marian!    ...ouch!
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                         34.
CONTINUED:
The sword is jabbed into his back. Robins faces the man
-- clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.
                        ROBIN
          You are truly courageous against
          an unarmed man.
The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps.
Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the
floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts,
drawing a dagger.
Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head.
Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.


OUTSIDE
The SOUND of the fight indoors.   Aslan hurls himself at
the door. It doesn't give.

INSIDE
Chunks of horn fly. Robin parries and thrusts.     The
horns get shorter. Robin retreats.
Left with just the nubs, Robin hurls the deer head at
the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges. Grabs the
dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops.
Robin wrenches off the mask.
Long hair tumbles down... a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.
The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through... just
in time to see the woman's knee fly up into Robin's
crotch. Robin folds. The battle is over. The young
woman stands over Robin.
                        YOUNG WOMAN
          As she was saying, we have
          no need of your protection.
Robin croaks through clenched teeth.
                       ROBIN
          Marian.
                                             CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN
Liquid tumbles into a goblet.   The three men at a table
in the kitchen.

The fat girl, SARAH, who pretended to be Marian, serves.
Flashes a lusty smile at Aslan, who glances at Robin --
"Help!" Marian arrives. In a gown. Stunning. An
impish grin.
                       MARIAN
         I trust Lord Locksley has
         recovered from his indisposition.
Aslan laughs.   Robin glares.

EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
Rock-strewn hills. Grazing sheep. Sun peeking through
clouds. Robin and Marian walk. Anger and anguish in
her voice.
                       MARIAN
         Why would he wish me to be
         protected by the boy who burned
         my hair when I was a child?
                       ROBIN
         We were together five terrible
         years in a Saracen prison.
                       MARIAN
         How do I know you didn't abandon
         him there to save your own skin.
Robin hands her Peter's ring.   She is shocked.
                       ROBIN
         Marian, I'm sorry.

                       MARIAN
         I will forward your condolences
         to my mother.
She turns her back.   He searches for a way to reach her.
                       ROBIN
         On my return, I found my father
         dead. The Sheriff denounced him
         as a Druid and took our lands.
                       MARIAN
         The people fear the Druids so much
         they'd believe anything.
         Nottingham would have me burned at
         the stake as a witch if he thought
         he could possess my property.

                       ROBIN
         Why do you not join your mother
         in London? You would be safer
         there.
                       MARIAN
         I will not retreat.     Besides, I
         have no interest in    life at court.
         Gossip-mongering and    currying
         favor. Here I am my     own person.
                       ROBIN
         The you must allow me to be your
         guardian.

                       MARIAN
         I do not need a guardian.
She turns to face him.   Streaming tears.
                       MARIAN
         My brother is dead. You cannot
         take his place.
Robin grabs and holds her.
                       ROBIN
         Marian, I don't want to replace
         him.
                       MARIAN
         What do you want?
Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin
moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away.

                       MARIAN
         This is wrong.
She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her.
Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan.
                       ASLAN
         Robin! The old man hears horses.
         Approaching fast.
He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the
hillside.
                       ASLAN
         Twenty or more. In battle armor.
                       MARIAN
         Soldiers coming here?     Is this
         your protection?
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                      37.
CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
         I killed some of the Sheriff's
         men. I fear I have placed you in
         danger.
                       MARIAN
         I can take care of myself. There
         are horses in the stable. Go!
Aslan runs into the stables.
                       ROBIN
         I'm not leaving.
Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two
bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by
Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the
soldiers.
                        MARIAN
         Stop them!   They're stealing my
         horses!
                       ROBIN
         Damn the girl! Aslan, can you
         ride?
In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a
single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs
in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the
estate wall.
                        ROBIN
         He can ride.
He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely
clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on.
Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.
                       GISBORNE
         You have been sheltering outlaws,
         Lady Marian.
                       MARIAN
         They're thieves, you imbecile.
         Bring back my horses, or the
         Sheriff will know of your
         cowardice.
Gisborne knows she is lying.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        38.

                       GISBORNE
         You're lucky he didn't steal your
         virtue too.
                (to his men)
         A crown to the man who brings me
         Locksley's head.
He leads the pursuit.   A SOLDIER hangs back.   Grabs
Marian's hair.
                       SOLDIER
         A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.
                        MARIAN
         Kiss this!

She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt.    Jabs
the blade into his wrist.
                       MARIAN
         Try me again, if you want to
         leave a hand behind.
Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks
down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently.
                                           CUT TO:
EXT. STREAM
Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan
hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half
a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men.
Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the
steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the
drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It
backs away.
                       ROBIN
         Damn you, animal!
Aslan shouts from the far bank.
                       ASLAN
         Treat it like a woman.
Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing
in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of
BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or
die.
                       ASLAN
         Have you never had a woman?
         Gently, man. Soothe it!

                       ROBIN
         Of course I've had a woman!
         Come on, pretty one.
He pats the horse soothingly.    The animal edges forward.
                        ASLAN
         Softly.   With your knees.
                        ROBIN
         I know!   I know!
The soldiers reload.   Robin urges the horse at the steep
drop.

                         ROBIN
         Easy, easy.
Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the
frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch
down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin
enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
                         ROBIN
         I love you!
The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.     Their
mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.
                       GISBORNE
                (yelling)
         Robin of the Hood! Son of the
         devil worshipper.
                       ROBIN
         What is your pleasure, Gisborne?

                       GISBORNE
         It was I who strung your father's
         corpse to the castle gate. My
         pleasure will be in doing the same
         to you.
                       ROBIN
         You survived one meeting.    Our next
         will be your last.
                       GISBORNE
         Your father died a coward, cursing
         your name and squealing like a
         stuck pig.
                         ROBIN
         That's a lie!

Incensed, he is losing his judgement.

                   (shouts)
            Come, Robin! He is trying to
            anger you into a trap.
A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in
fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne
split off, are climbing the embankment towards him.
Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters
them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to
follow.

Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub.
Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
                          ROBIN
            We have lost them. I'll lame this
            mare if I ask her to go any farther.
He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens
his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square
leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds
it to his eye. A primitive telescope.
Robin watches, curious.

SCOPE POV
Through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind
them.

The soldiers are close!

He reacts in shock. Prepares to defend himself.    Then
realizes they are still in the distance.

         No.    Arab science.
He replaces the tube in his pouch.
                       ASLAN
         How did your uneducated
         kind ever take Jerusalem?
                        ROBIN
         God knows!

Aslan laughs.   Robin points towards an endless expanse of
trees.
                       ROBIN
         We can lose them in the forest.
                       DUNCAN
         Sherwood is haunted, Master.
                       ROBIN
         Either we take our chances
         with the ghosts, or become
         ghosts ourselves.
He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men
thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering
around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin
looks back.
                       ROBIN
         They're not following.

Gisborne curses his men, urging them on.
                       GISBORNE
         Come on, damn you! There are
         only three of them.
                       SOLDIER
         It's not the men we fear, sir.
Eerie HOWLING and RATTLING of bones.    Aslan draws his
sword.
                       DUNCAN
         Banshees. They say they fly in
         your mouth and suck you dry of

         Be quiet!    Listen.
WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly
SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites
around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds,
striking only air.
                       ASLAN
         Allah protect us from the evil
         spirits.
Duncan clings to his back.   Robin points.
                        ROBIN
         Behind you!
Aslan slashes out, futilely.
                         ROBIN
         No, there!    And there!
Aslan flails.   Robin cracks up.
                       ASLAN
         Cease your mad laughing.     I can
         feel them.
Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of
hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such
strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end.
A low chilling MOAN.
                       ROBIN
         Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A
         child's toy put to good use. You
         scare easily, my painted Saladin.
His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red-
jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope.
Catapults him to the ground.
The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men,
armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth-
century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL
SCARLET, leaps around Robin.
                       WILL SCARLET

The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their
distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to
grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall
         down. Beg for mercy, rich man.

         Yeah, bollocks, mate.

Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven
feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a
vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet.
His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes
when he laughs, which is often.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         What are ya, m'old cock?
                       ROBIN

         ...Hood.   Robin Hood.   Who are
         you?
                        JOHN LITTLE
         John Little.   Bestman o' the
         woods.
                        ROBIN
         Bestman?   You lead this rabble?
                       WILL SCARLET
         We waste time. Tax him.
                        ROBIN
         Tax?   For what?
                       WILL SCARLET
         For passage through Sherwood.
                       ROBIN
         I will pay no tax. Besides, I
         have nothing but my cloak and
         my sword.

                       WILL SCARLET
         A man who travels with two servants
         and claims he's without money, is
         either a fool or a liar.
Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something
CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily,
Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet.
                       WILL SCARLET
         And this one is a liar.
                (he bites the metal)
         Ahah! Gold!
The men cheer.   John snatches the medallion back from
Will.
                       ROBIN
         That is sacred to me.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Sacred to us too, mush. This
         here'll feed us for a bloomin'
         month.
Robin draws his sword.
                       ROBIN
         You will have to fight me for it.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         I'd love to, mate.
He grins hugely.   A boy pushes his way through the throng.
                         WULF
         Wait, father!    I know him.
                       ROBIN
         This man is your father? Tell him
         how I saved your hide from the
         Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves
         some gratitude, I believe.
He reaches for the medallion.    John pulls it away.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Naw ya don't, laddie.
                       WILL SCARLET
         You must be Robin of Locksley.
         The blackguard who abandoned us to
         Nottingham's plundering.

         Be careful, Father. He fights
         like a demon. He walloped six o'
         Sheriff's men?
                        JOHN LITTLE
         Is that so?
Another grin. Licking his lips in anticipation, he
lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free.
Bends it into a pretzel.
                        ROBIN
         Aslan!

Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut.
John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with
one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's
stomach. Robin folds.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Oh dear! The little rich boy is
         lost for words. Thanks for the
         taxes, Locksley.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         And for the laughs.
The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into
the tree. Will administers one final kick before
leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously
at Aslan.
                       ROBIN
         Son of an Arab whore! Once again
         your assistance was invaluable.

                       ASLAN
         You seemed more in danger of losing
         your pride than your life.
                       DUNCAN
         I recognized some of the voices.
         Many were from your father's farms.
                       ASLAN
         Your avenging army, my friend.
                        ROBIN
         That rabble?
                       ASLAN
         All they need is a leader.

         Defeat him and they will follow
         you.
                       ROBIN
         Allah has taken your brains.
                       DUNCAN
         I hear the voice of a spoiled
         child, Master Robin. I suggest
         you cease your brave talk of
         revenge and flee to the north.
                       ROBIN
         You, too? You expect me to
         fight that behemoth?
                       DUNCAN
         Your father would expect you to
         act like a man.
                                           CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The
ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge.
Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge,
brandishing a long wooden staff.
                       ROBIN
         This is my bridge. No one crosses
         without paying tax.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Just bugger off, mate, huh?
                       ROBIN
         If you wish to cross, it will
         cost you a gold medallion.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Ain't I hurt you a bloody nuff
         for one day?
                       WILL SCARLET
         If he's in a hurry to end his
         mortal misery, help him.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                       ROBIN
         You don't have the courage to
         face me again, John Little? Or
         should I call you 'Little John'?
John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff.   Strides to the
bridge.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Alright, m'old cock. You wanna
         nuther good wallopin'?
His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan
and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John
storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin
connects a blow on John's foot.
The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a
couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings,
which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for
blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing.
Enjoying the time of his life.
Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength.
Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John
hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly.
Aslan watches impassively.
Robin scrambles back onto the bridge.   John waits,
grinning.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Lil' wet behind the ears, mate?
                       WILL SCARLET
         Don't fool with him. Get him!

John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots
of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks.
John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows
him time to right himself.
John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from
the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is
beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Swimmin' time again, ol' chum.
The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters.
Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not
re-emerge. John waits. The spectators rush to the bank.
No sign.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                       JOHN LITTLE
         Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave
         'un.
Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp
onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might.
John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic.
                        JOHN LITTLE
         Help!   Cain't bloody swim.
He submerges again.   Robin pulls his head above water.
                         ROBIN
         Do you yield?

The terrified giant sputters. Goes under again, flailing
with arms and legs. Robin holds his head just above the
surface.
                         ROBIN
         Do you yield?
                         JOHN LITTLE
         Yes!
                        ROBIN
         Good.   Now put your feet down.
John struggles, then his feet hit bottom... The water
only reaches his chest.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         I'll be buggered.
                       ROBIN
         Pay me the tax.
A tense pause while all wait for Little's reaction.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Robin Hood, ya got balls o' solid
         rock.
He hands Robin back the medallion. Chuckling loudly, he
swoops Robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
A BONFIRE CRACKLES. The woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and
fight. A rabble. John passes Robin a jug.
                        LITTLE JOHN
         Mead.   Made it m'self.

            A fine brew, Little John.
He spits black objects from his mouth.      Dead bees.   John
grins.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            Real honey.
He takes the jug back. Sneezes royally, spewing all over
the brew. Oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to
Aslan.
                          ASLAN
            With regrets, I decline.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            An Englishman's mead not bleedin'
            good enough for ya?
                          ASLAN
            On the contrary. I thank you,
            but my faith prevents me from
            partaking in such enjoyments.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            Your bloody loss, mate.
He swigs.    Passes the jug on to Duncan, who drinks
heartily.    Wulf cautiously approaches Robin.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            What is it, boy? Speak up!
                          WULF
            I wanna thankee, Lord Locksley.
            I owes ya m'life.
                          ROBIN
            You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am
            glad I chanced by in time to help.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            C'mon, lad, drink! 'Twill put
            hair on your bloomin' chest.
Wulf tries the brew. The impact is instant.       He turns
green and runs. His father cracks up.
                          ROBIN
            Tell me about your men, John.
John points to a short fellow with the build of a tree
trunk.

         Because you are short?

         Nay.   'Cuz I be so long.

Proudly, he starts to pull down his pants.
                         ROBIN
         No, Bull.    Save it for the ladies.
Drunken laughter.    Robin turns to the next man at the
fireside.
                       ROBIN
         Your name, friend?
The man's bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to
respond, but he stutters too badly to get out a
comprehensible word.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         That be Hal Brownwell, but the
         lads call i'm Hal Hiccup.
The others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up
at Hal's embarrassment. Hal strikes out angrily at his
tormentors.
                       ROBIN
         Hold! Hal, you have the face and
         hands of a farmer. I wager you
         are a strong and honest man, and
         I'd be glad to have you at my side
         in a fight. The next man who makes
         light of you will have to answer
         to me.
There is murmuring around the group, but no one elects
to try it.

         Your ghosts will only keep his

         Soon the Sheriff will hunt you

         There are many here who knew my

         man. I doubt that in their hearts
         they believe him capable of such a
         horror.
Murmurs of agreement from around the fire.    Robin turns

         The man's our guest.
Will gets up.   Angrily pushes his way out of the group.

         That there's Will Scarlet. Pay 'im
         no 'eed. 'E's full o' piss and wind.

                       ROBIN
         He is right to distrust me. I am
         a rich man's son. I have done no
         honest labor. But today I am as
         poor as any of you. Nottingham
         has stolen all that I own. And
         when I killed Gisborne's men, I,
         too, became an outlaw.

         We can win.   And I believe we will.

         Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood,

         Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack

Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long
draught of mead.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - SUNRISE
A steady trickle of RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose
of the sleeping Saracen. He wakes, cursing. All around
him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered with
rags and hides coughing and sneezing. A sorry mess.
Robin sits, brooding.

         I have led you wrong. This is no
         army. These men live like dogs.
                         ROBIN
         English dogs.    They can learn.
                        ASLAN
         Learn what?   To build kennels?
He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan
is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side.
The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously
hung-over.

                       ROBIN
         Too much mead, old friend.    What
         day is it?
                       DUNCAN
         Sunday, I believe.
                       ROBIN
         Good. Do they still give alms
         to the poor at the mass?
                       DUNCAN
         They do. These days the need for
         mercy is greater than ever.
                       ROBIN
         Then I must ask you a favor.
EXT. ROAD TO NOTTINGHAM - DAY

Duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. Body
stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. Ahead is
the main gate to the walled city of Nottingham.
Fresh horse manure. A man's hand reaches into it and
spreads it over his clothes. And his face -- Robin,
dressed as Duncan.

EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing
stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.
                         GUARD
         Hey, you!
Robin keeps going.   A hand clasps his shoulder.    Spins
him 'round.

                       GUARD
         Do I know you?
Robin gazes into space, trying to look blind.   The Guard
sniffs his soiled hand.
                       GUARD
         My God, you stink!
                       ROBIN
         Pardon my blindness, sir.    I'm
         always falling down.
                        GUARD
         Yeech!   Get away from me.

He launches a kick in Robin's rear. Robin hobbles away,
hiding a smile. The Guard tries to wipe off his hand on
the wall.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY
Jesus hangs from the cross. A magnificent stained glass
window. In the ornate pulpit, the BISHOP OF HEREFORD,
bedecked in ermine.
                       BISHOP
         We beseech thy blessing, Lord, on
         all your people, but most
         especially on our noble Lord
         Nottingham. Grant him the wisdom
         to guide and protect our glorious
         city.
Nottingham and Gisborne sit piously among the congrega-
tion of nobles and wealthy merchants.
                       BISHOP
         Grant him also the strength to
         bring to justice the lawless men
         who threaten its safety. Help
         him to stamp out the curse of the
         dread Druids who would seize from
         us our children, even as wolves
         steal the lambs from their mothers.
The rear of the church. Standing crushed together, the
poor and afflicted. Old and young. Starving children.
Among them, Robin.
The sermon ends. As the nobles file out, the poor are
galvanized. Begging hands reach out.

         3.   Pity, fine sir.
         4.   For my baby.
         5.   Etc.
The rich drop a few mites, sparking a mad scramble.
Church officials roughly keep order. Marian passes some
coins to the mother of a small child. A hand grabs her
wrist.
                       ROBIN
         Alms for a blind man. For one
         who cannot see your beauty.

                       MARIAN
                (recognizing him)
         This is dangerous.
                       ROBIN
         So you care for my safety?
                       MARIAN
         No, for mine. I do not wish
         to be seen with an outlaw.
                       ROBIN
         Under the Sheriff's law, that's
         a badge of pride.
                       MARIAN
         He's put a price on your head.
                       ROBIN
         How much?

                       MARIAN
         A hundred gold pieces.
                       ROBIN
         Is that all? I have not annoyed
         him enough. Soon he will offer
         ten thousand.
                       MARIAN
         For ten thousand I would turn you
         in myself.
                (glances back at
                 the Sheriff)
         Nottingham is mounting an army.
                       ROBIN
         How do you know?

                       MARIAN
         He has rounded up every blacksmith
         in the county. He has them holed
         up in the castle making swords and
         armor.
                       ROBIN
         What is he planning?
                       MARIAN
         I don't know, but there's no limit
         to the man's ambitions.
                (as Sheriff heads
                 towards them)
         Go!

                       ROBIN
         If you need me, I will be with
         the woodsmen. Send for me as
         'Robin Hood.'
                        MARIAN
         Robin!   Do something for me.
                        ROBIN
         What?
                        MARIAN
         Take a bath.
                       ROBIN
         Care to join me?
With a grin, he slips into the crowd as Nottingham
arrives.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         You shine like the sun, my lady.
He raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle.
Kisses it.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You have been meeting with young
         Robin of Locksley.
                (as she tries to
                 hide her shock)
         My cousin tells me the knave
         deprived you of some horses.
                       MARIAN
                (recovering)
         Yes. A most disagreeable
         experience.

         I deeply regret it, and I promise
         you he will be brought to justice.
         For subjecting you to such
         treatment, I will hang him from
         the walls with his own entrails.
That gleam of insanity.   Robin watches from a distance.
                       MARIAN
         I would like to see that, my lord.
The Sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         My dear, a woman of your refinement
         is not safe living alone. If you
         would consent to bring your
         household within the city walls,
         I could give your needs my most
         personal attention.
                       MARIAN
         I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from
         the heart, but for now I prefer to
         stay in my family's ancestral home.
         My cousin, King Richard, will be
         deeply moved to hear of your
         concern for my welfare.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Alas, the King has many enemies
         both abroad and at home. I fear
         for his safe return.
                       MARIAN
         Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will
         return. When he does, he will
         wish to reward his faithful subjects.
The Sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave. Marian
deflates with relief. The Sheriff walks alone towards
a side door.
                       BEGGAR
                (Robin)
         Alms, my lord.
Nottingham makes to shove the man aside. With a swift
move, the beggar grabs the Sheriff in a headlock.
Slides Nottingham's own dagger to his throat and drags
him out of sight.

                       ROBIN
         Remember young Robin of Locksley,
         Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your
         nemesis. Your avenging angel.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         If you kill me, you will hang.

         What do you want?
                       ROBIN

         chance you do not deserve. A
         chance to right your wrongs.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         I'm listening.
                       ROBIN
         From this day forward you will
         cease to tax my people. You will
         renounce the charges against my
         father, and you will return his
         lands to me.

         Why should I?
                       ROBIN
         Because for every harm you do,
         I swear by God I shall visit on
         you threefold in return.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Empty words.
                       ROBIN
         I am here with a blade at your
         throat. As long as I live, you
         will always know that I could be
         here again.
A YELL from across the church. Gisborne has spotted them.
Robin digs the knife a little deeper.

         Then it will begin..
Gisborne yells orders.   Robin hurls Nottingham against
the wall.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY

Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's
horse, which is held by a stunned groom. He rides
through the busy marketplace. A crossbowman tracks
him. A sure shot.
Marian spots the danger. She fakes being tripped and
stumbles into the bowman. His bolt flies harmlessly
into the air.
                       MARIAN
                (innocently)
         Please excuse my clumsiness.
Robin charges for the city gate. As he passes, he kicks
the guard who hasseled him into the wall.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
Men gather around as Robin dismounts, admiring the horse.

                       ROBIN
         A personal loan from the Sheriff.
                       ASLAN

         How so? You have not raised a
         finger to protect me.

         my pledge.
                       ROBIN
         Aslan, if I didn't know better,
         I would swear you were worried
         about me.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL
The Sheriff maniacally spits out orders to Gisborne.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Starve them out. Slaughter their
         livestock. I want to see Locksley's
         own people fighting each other to
         bring him to us.
                       GISBORNE
         I swear he will not live to see
         the next full moon.

EXT. HAMLET - DAY
A SQUEALING HOG is loaded onto a wagon. SOLDIERS round
up the livestock. An old FARMER protests.
                       FARMER
         Go' bless ya, sir. Leave us the
         sow. She's with young 'uns. The
         next litter'll feed us through
         the winter.

This provokes a barrage of protests.   The men are angry.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Brave talk, Locksley. I say we
         take the rich boy in.
Murmurs of general agreement.
                       ROBIN
         Will, do you think the Sheriff will
         give everything back after I am
         gone?

         Alright, Will. You can take me
         in on one condition. You must

         Dead, Locksley.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY (LATER)
Hands tighten a girth. Will confidently jokes with his
cronies. Woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators.
Little John and his wife, Fanny, keep to themselves,
while Wulf openly talks with Robin, Aslan and Duncan.
Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged
with scars.
                       ASLAN
         This man has true purpose.    He
         means to kill you.
                       DUNCAN
         And you have given him the means.
                       WULF
         Will is ruthless, Robin.    Guard
         your back.
                       ROBIN
         I am grateful for your concern,
         friends, but I have to prove to
         them it is possible to overcome
         unequal odds.
                (shouts)
         I am ready, Will.
Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly
grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs
in his heels.
Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin
clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins
back to the attack.
His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls
aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.

Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs
Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder.
Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides
right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away.
Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's
chest.
Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his
lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly.
Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword.
Robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough.
Douses his face. Yells at Will.

                       ROBIN
         Come on, you little piss pot.
         Do your worst!
Will grabs a spear from a bystander. Robin stands his
ground. Will lunges, Robin sidesteps.
                       ROBIN
         The horse is smarter than you are,
         Will.
Some of the men laugh. Will is incensed. Robin ducks
and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges.
Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.

                        ROBIN
         Here, Will!   You aim like a girl,
         Will!
Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter
spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's
legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug
of war.
Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away.
Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back-
wards off his mount.
Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen
adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The
point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will
wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.
                       ROBIN
         Thank the Lord you are not endowed
         like Bull.

The crowd is convulsed with laughter. Robin catches his
breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and
runs at him. A strong hand grasps Will's arm as he is
about to strike.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Bollocks, Will. Jus' bugger off,
         eh?
Overpowered, Will relents.   With a defiant glance, he
skulks away.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya got us by the short and curlies,
         Robin Hood. Now let's hear what ya
         got to bleedin' say.

Robin scans the faces.     He has their attention.
                          ROBIN
            Nottingham has taken from us
            everything we own. Now we are
            going to start taking from him.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            'Ow in bloody blazes are we gonna
            do that?
                          ROBIN
            We are going to tax him.
                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
Autumn. The forest is a mosaic of green, gold, orange,
and red. A giant eye in a circle of glass. Aslan, his
telescope raised.
                          ASLAN
            Here they come.
                          ROBIN
            How many?
                           ASLAN
            Two wagons.   Twenty escort.
                           ROBIN
            Twenty?   They usually have five.
He grabs the telescope.

SCOPE POV
A phalanx of   mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with
barrels, and   a tax wagon. The wagon is an armored box on
wheels, with   crossbow slits in the side. Guy of Gisborne
commands the   escort.
BACK TO SCENE
                          ROBIN
            This is no ordinary convoy.
Bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods-
men lies nervously in ambush.
                          BULL
            'ow many?
                                                (CONTINUED)

                       ROBIN
         Er, about ten.
                (then, to Aslan)
         Why scare them? They can't count
         anyway.
                       ASLAN
         And they call me the barbarian.
                         ROBIN
         Let's go.
Together they run down the hill, keeping low.
Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a
fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing
from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the
barrels.
ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A
soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload
their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces
camouflaged.
The mounted soldiers charge them. The  woodsmen run into
the trees. As the horsemen close in,  the runners leap
into a trench. Lift up matted screens  of brush and
grass. It's as if they disappeared.   The soldiers slash
wildly at the thick screens.
More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin
in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods-
men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne
urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file,
beating their way through the tangled branches.

The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on
ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The
horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the
river gorge. Momentum  carries many of them over the
cliff.
BACK ON ROADWAY
Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax
wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are
unable to fire at them.
Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar
hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his
head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse,
driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen
is lifted into place, covering their route.

CONTINUED:
Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone.
He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and
cursing.
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof.     Angry shouts
from inside.
                       ROBIN
         Surrender your weapons. I give
         you my word you shall go free.
In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near
his feet.

                       ROBIN
         Ah, I feared as much.
He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the
river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside,
panic. Drowning rats.
The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead.
Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at
them.
                                               CUT TO:
COUNTRYSIDE
Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The
lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in
astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with
glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around.
Cheers of celebration.

                       LITTLE JOHN
                (awestruck)
         I'll be buggered.
                       ROBIN
         This treasure had a purpose.     We
         must find out what.
He turns at the sound of a brawl from the Friar's cart.
The Friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies.
                        ROBIN
         Get off him.   He's a man of the
         cloth.
Robin drags the men off. The Friar clambers to his feet.
Around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen.

CONTINUED:
                       FRIAR
         The Lord's blessing on you, kind
         sir. These sinners were attempting
         to steal these libations destined
         for the monks of St. Catherine's.
He indicates his cargo of barrels.
                       ROBIN
         It appears to me, Reverend Friar,
         that many of the libations have
         found their way into your own
         esteemed person.
Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart.

                       FRIAR
         A thousand pardons, sir, but duty
         beckons. I must hasten on.
                       ROBIN
                (grabbing the bridle)
         A moment, my reverend friend. You
         travel with poor company when you
         travel with Nottingham's soldiers.
                         BULL
         Aye, tax him.
This sparks a chorus of comments.
                       ROBIN
         My men are thirsty and have much
         to celebrate.
                       FRIAR
         Lord bless me, sir, are these your
         men? I had mistook them for
         common thieves. Kindly step
         aside.
                       ROBIN
         Surely the Lord has the charity to
         spare a few barrels to good
         Christian men.
The Friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins.
                       FRIAR
         Well, sir, if you wish them to
         share in the good Lord's brew...
Casually reaching under the seat, he pulls out a club.
Smites Robin with it.

                       FRIAR
         ... you must best me for it.
Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed,
Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal
full in the face.
                         FRIAR
         Giddyup, nag!
The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises
his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs
after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the
cart.

                       ROBIN
         You leave when I say.
Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward.
                       FRIAR
         Protect me, Lord.
He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under
him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf!
                         FRIAR
         Yield!
He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe.
The woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle.
                       FRIAR
         Confess that Friar Tuck is a
         better, holier, and braver man
         than thou art, knave.

                        ROBIN
         Never!   Whoomf!
                         FRIAR
         Yield, I say!    Yield to Friar
         Tuck.
Desperate, Robin bites the Friar's leg. Tuck howls.
Robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. Smashes
the Friar's head with his drinking jug.
                       ROBIN
         Yield yourself!
He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the
ground.

                       ROBIN
         Yield to Robin Hood.
Tuck holds up a hand in surrender.    Robin eases off.
                       FRIAR
                (feeling his head)
         Thank you, Lord, for teaching me
         humility.
                       ROBIN
         Well, Friar Tuck. We have need
         of an honest man of God, to
         minister to these men and their
         families. What do you say?

The Friar struggles to his feet. He reviews the motley
faces of his potential flock. His eyes light on the
grinning Saracen.
                       FRIAR
         I'd rather roast in hell.
He punches Robin in the gut.
                                              CUT TO:

FRIAR TUCK
strapped into the traces, pulls the beer cart. Sweating
profusely, grunting with strain. His horse contentedly
follows.
                       ROBIN
         Giddyup, Friar.

He flicks the reins, steering the cart into camp. Women
and children rush to greet their men. Jeer the roped
soldier-prisoners. The Friar checks out his flock. A
woman curtsies, another crosses herself, children touch
his robe in wonder.
                       ROBIN
         What do you say now, Tuck?    Here
         are the meek of the earth.
Tuck surveys the hopeful, hungry faces. The little
hamlet of half-built huts. He folds his hands in a
moment of prayer.
                       FRIAR
         The Lord moves in mysterious
         ways. I accept.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP
A blazing fire. Deer carcasses roast. Tuck's barrels
supply the refreshment. Robin and Aslan pass out coins
to each family.

         he's very hard to reason with.
With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan   leaps INTO VIEW.
Stripped to the waist, brandishing   his scimitar. The
Captain tries to back away. Robin    tries to restrain
Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling,    drooling at the mouth,
Aslan explores the Captain's body   with his hands. A
butcher checking meat.
                       ROBIN
         I strongly advise you to talk.
         He hasn't eaten in weeks.

                       CAPTAIN
                (rising terror)
         What does he want?

         No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan.
         ... How about this other one?...
         Fatter, yes... more meat.
The other soldier, who definitely  has more flesh on the
bone, is struck dumb with horror,  as Aslan turns his
attention to him. With one swing   of his sword, Aslan
slices through the man's ropes.   Drags him to his feet.
Little John runs over.

                       LITTLE JOHN
                (urgent)
         No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin'

         I cannot stop him, John. Besides,
         if they will not tell what they
         know, then they must pay the price.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Kill 'em aye, but not like this.
         'Tain't Christian.
Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan
has dragged his victim. The Captain's face pales. Then
silence.

The demented Arab slowly reappears. Blood drips from his
lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end
of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm.
Turning to Robin, Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates
wildly at the Captain.
                       CAPTAIN
         What does he say?
                       ROBIN
         Well, roughly, he says that he
         doesn't care for the way your
         friend tastes, and he wants you.
                       CAPTAIN
         No, God, no! I'll talk. Just
         keep him away. Keep him away!

BEHIND WAGON
Bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth
and trying to suppress his own laughter. Beside them
lies a large chunk of venison. The man is unharmed,
except that he's missing a glove.

INT. WOODSMAN'S HUT - NIGHT
The walls shake with Little John's laughter.

venison.

         Since he also has every Smith
         in the country working in his
         castle, we can assume he is
         planning a little war.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Agin' who?

INT. CASTLE ARMORY - NIGHT
Sparks. Smoke. Sweat. The Sheriff inspects his weapon
factory. His eyes glint with the reflections of the
smithy's fires.
A DOOR CRASHES open behind him. FOOTSTEPS. Paying no
heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. It's blade white-
hot.
                       GISBORNE
         We were ambushed. In Sherwood
         Forest.
Nottingham tests the sword against an anvil.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Spanish steel, cousin. So much
         stronger than our native blades.
         Any losses?
                       GISBORNE
         All the men are gone.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Yet again you are the sole
         survivor, cousin? Interesting.
         And the gold?
                       GISBORNE
         Well, it er... disappeared.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       74.

The Sheriff looks at Gisborne for the first time.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Robin Hood?
                       GISBORNE
         They were woodsmen, dressed in
         green.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Robin Hood.
He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Cousin, we must be strong. We
         cannot allow this outlaw to make
         fools of us.
Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's
belly.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         And I cannot allow a lieutenant
         to fail me.
                (turning to the
                 horrified smithy)
         It is indeed fine steel.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
A small procession. Tuck drives his cart, Bull the tax
wagon. Both vehicles laden with supplies. Wulf and Hal
pass out flour, chickens, blankets, clothing to the
villagers. Their weapons are prominently displayed.
Tuck swigs from a jar, passes it to an old villager.
                       FRIAR
         God bless you, sir.
                       VILLAGER
         An' Go' bless Robin 'Ood, friar.
         They says as 'ow none o' the
         Sheriff's cronies dare go within
         miles o' Sherwood for fear o'
         havin' their pockets pinched.
                       FRIAR
         Ah, the good Lord giveth and the
         good Lord taketh away.
                       OLD WOMAN
         Unless Robin Hood takes it first!

                                                     75.
CONTINUED:
Laughter. The procession passes two of the Sheriff's
mounted soldiers. They glumly watch as Tuck raises his
jug in greeting.
                       FRIAR
         Good morrow, brothers.

EXT. FOREST POOL - DAY
Water, sparkling with sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives
in naked. He luxuriates in the cool water... HOOFBEATS.
He attempts to hide... too late. Four horses emerge from
the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant
Sarah sandwiched between them. Bull has a black eye.
Marian jumps down.
                       MARIAN
                (to Robin)
         How dare you!
                       ROBIN
         Good morning, Lady Marian.
In response, she starts pelting him with stones.
                       MARIAN
         You send men to drag me from my
         home in the middle of the night,
         like some slave girl? Is this
         the way the famous Robin Hood
         treats a lady?
                       ROBIN
         Ah well... er, let me finish this
         bath you wished me to take. Then
         I'll explain.
                       MARIAN
         I demand an explanation right now!
                       ROBIN
         If you will be patient, I could
         spare your propriety by...
                       MARIAN
         I will decide when my propriety
         is compromised.
                         ROBIN
         As you wish.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     76.

He wades bare-ass naked out of the water towards her.
She casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body,
glistening with water.
                       MARIAN
         How dare you expose yourself to
         me?!
She slugs him. Robin stumbles backwards into the water.
Bull grins, gesturing to Sarah and pointing to his own
black eye.
                       BULL
         The big 'un did the same to me.


EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
An arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a
tree. Little John lowers his crossbow, delighted at
his shot.
                       LITTLE JOHN
                (to Wulf)
         Right m'lad. Let's see how close
         you can git to that bugger.
Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his
father's arrow, splitting it in two. Little John slaps
Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Take a gander at this 'un, mates.
         Never seen nuthin' like it in
         my bloomin' life.

Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of
a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac-
ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses,
camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not
about to admit it.
                       MARIAN
         This better be damned important.
Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap-
tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats
and... the treasure chest. At Robin's nod, Bull throws
back the lid. Marian is speechless.
                       ROBIN
         Nottingham robs the poor. We
         rob Nottingham and give back to
         the poor.

                        MARIAN
          Do you think he's going to let
          you get away with all this? The
          man is without mercy. He will
          annihilate you.
                        ROBIN
          Somebody has to take a stand.
                        MARIAN
          You're taking a stand with the
          lives of these people. These
          young ones.
A beat. She checks the faces. Her eyes meet Robin's.
Is there a hint of concern for him also?
                        MARIAN
          What do you want from me?
                        ROBIN
          Nottingham was sending this gold
          to buy reinforcements from the
          Celtic tribesmen. We need to
          warn King Richard.
                        MARIAN
          Nottingham would not dare
          challenge the King.
                        ROBIN
          The King is not in England to
          be challenged, is he? While he
          is away, he may lose his country.
                 (Marian masks her
                  concern)
          You are Richard's cousin. You
          can get word to him. He would
          believe you.
                        MARIAN
          Now you want me to participate
          in your folly?
A little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild
flowers. Touched, Marian kneels to accept the offering.

         I am sending Duncan with you.
         Give him some warm food and a
         real bed. I grow tired of his
         bellyaching.
                       DUNCAN
         Hah! I have endured more hardship
         in my lifetime than any man here.
Robin laughs and speaks to Marian in a stage whisper.
                       ROBIN
         Don't tell him I told you, but
         he may be useful to you. There
         is no one to whom I would rather
         entrust your safety.
                       MARIAN
         Duncan, you are most welcome.
Taking the lead rein from Duncan's horse, she rides away.
                       ROBIN
                (calls after her)
         Will you send word to the King?
                       MARIAN
         I'll think about it.

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
A globule of red liquid.    A signet ring.   Marian seals
a letter.


INT. BISHOP'S CASTLE - DAY
The letter is held in the pudgy, jeweled fingers of the
Bishop of Hereford. A lavish office.
                       MARIAN
         It is a personal matter, my Lord,
         but one of vital importance.
                       BISHOP
         I understand, my dear lady.
         This is my most trusted emissary.
He hands the letter to a solemn courier.

         You will travel to France
         immediately. You must give this

         King, and him alone.
The courier bows in acknowledgement.    Marian indicates
Sarah.
                       MARIAN
         My lady-in-waiting will accompany
         you.
Surprised, the courier glances at the Bishop.

                       BISHOP
         My dear, I could not vouch for
         her safety. The journey is fraught
         with danger.
                       MARIAN
         I appreciate your concern, my
         Lord, but Sarah is an accomplished
         rider. I must insist that she
         goes along.
                       BISHOP
                (a beat)
         As you wish.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
An informal council of war.   Robin uses a stick in the
dirt.

                       ROBIN
         We have to be ready to move camp
         at any time. The only way we can
         be attacked is from the Nottingham
         Road. We hide lookouts in the
         trees, here and here. If they
         see soldiers, they shoot warning
         arrows. Whistles by day, fire
         by night.
Wulf runs up to Little John in panic.
                        WULF
         Father!   Come quick.   Mother's
         dying.

INT. WOODSMEN'S HUT - DAY
Fanny Little writhes in agony.    John rushes in.   Tuck
looks up from Fanny's side.
                       FRIAR
         The child comes early.
Fanny screams.   John kneels beside her, taking her head.
                         LITTLE JOHN
         Hush, m'lass.    Ya'll be fine.
                       FANNY
         'S not like t'others, John.    Oh
         God, it pains me so.

                       LITTLE JOHN
                (angrily, to Tuck)
         Ya're sittin' thar like a fat
         sow. Help her, man, help her!
                       FRIAR
         I am doing all I can.
Aslan appears in the doorway, with Robin. Whips back the
blanket. Fanny's chest is covered with black squirming
creatures.
                       ASLAN
         By Allah, leeches!
He starts to pull the parasites off.    Tuck jumps at him.
                       FRIAR
         Get away from her!
Aslan pushes him away, continuing his work.

                       ASLAN
         Blood is like air. If she loses
         blood, she and the child will die.
John is paralyzed with confusion.    Tuck appeals to Robin.
                       FRIAR
         He lies. He is the devil's seed,
         sent to lead us astray.
                       ASLAN
         Fool, both the Bible and the Koran
         instruct us to preserve life.
Tuck raises an arm to strike Aslan. Robin blocks the
blow. Aslan gently touches the mother's stomach.

         savage?
                       ASLAN
                (to John)
         If you will allow me, I can help
         her. It will not be without
         danger.

                       FRIAR
         Do not listen to him!   He will
         kill her.
                       ASLAN
         If you do not listen to me, she
         will certainly die. And the
         child, too.
Fanny cries out.   John looks to Robin, pleading for
advice.
                       ROBIN
         The good Friar has done all he
         can. I suggest you let the Arab
         try.
                (as John is
                 undecided)
         If I am wrong, and they die, then
         you may take my life.

John's eyes meet his wife's.   She nods.
                        LITTLE JOHN
         So be it.
                       FRIAR
         Then it will be on your head.
         I have warned you.
He storms out.   All business, Aslan speaks to Wulf.
                       ASLAN
         Bring me a needle, thread, water,
         a skinning knife, and burning
         ashes.
Wulf runs to obey. John looks horrified. Robin eases
him outside, then returns to Aslan's side. They
whisper.

          the knife.
                          ROBIN
          The knife?
                        ASLAN
          I have seen it many times with
          horses.
                       ROBIN
          Horses? By the Lord, what are
          her chances?
                        ASLAN
          After wasting so much blood...
          not good.
                        ROBIN
          Now you tell me!
Wulf runs back in.     Aslan holds up a piece of wood.

                 (to Fanny)
          Are you ready?... Bite down on
          this... Robin, hold her steady.
He lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes.

OUTSIDE

Little John paces. Wulf comes out of the hut.      Families
hover and wait. From inside, MUFFLED GROANS.

Robin cannot watch... a WAIL! Aslan mutters something

         What did you say?
Aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant.
                        ASLAN
         It is a boy.
The mother revives.   Aslan places the child on her
breast.

         Your son, my lady... Robin, hold
         her skin together while I sew her
         up.
He picks up the needle and thread.   Robin's eyes turn to
the woman's abdomen... He faints.
                                             CUT TO:

LITTLE JOHN
marches among the cheering families, holding his newborn
child high for all to see. Tuck sits miserably to one
side. Bloody and  exhausted, Aslan appears at the hut
door. Tuck jumps  to his feet, drawing his knife.
Heads turn. Tense silence. Robin appears, unsteadily,
behind Aslan. Watches, ready to intervene. Tuck stares
at Aslan. Raises his blade... and slices down across
his own wrist.
                       FRIAR
         This day God has taught me a fine
         lesson.
He hands Aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist.
                       FRIAR
         I would be honored.
Aslan slices his own wrist. The two wrists clasp
together in the universal sign of brotherhood. Everyone
cheers.
                       FRIAR
         You are a good man, my barbarian
         friend.

         We shall open a barrel together
         and I shall do my damndest to
         save your heathen soul.

         Alas, I am not permitted...
                       FRIAR
         Our God made this brew, brother.
         I merely combined the ingredients.
         Do you dare to insult his works?

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Hooves fly along a track. Sarah and the courier.    The
courier reins in, Sarah draws alongside.
                       SARAH
         What is wrong?
                       COURIER
         My horse seems to be favoring
         a foreleg.
Sarah leans down to look and the courier cudgels her
across the neck. She falls from the saddle, unconscious.

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Flickering candlelight. Marian is alone, reading. A
sudden gust extinguishes her candle. HAMMERING and
SHOUTING from a distant part of the house. Unnerved,
she calls out.

                          MARIAN
         Who is there?     Duncan!

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Marian enters stealthily. A candle in one hand, a
drawn dagger in the other. Something leaps at her!...
A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She
shoos him down.
                       MARIAN
         Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice.
She sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind.   A
masked SOLDIER.

                       SOLDIER
         We meet again.
He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his
mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. He prods
her with his sword.
                       SOLDIER
         Drop your blade.
                       MARIAN
         You are still overmatched, soldier.
She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table.
Lays his blade against her chest.

                       SOLDIER
         You owe me favors, wench. Bare
         your breasts... or I will do it
         for you.
Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her
dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs
a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face.
Screaming, he grabs his  face. She reaches for her
dagger. He slashes with   his sword. She backs to the
fireplace, grabs a spit  of roasted chickens... drives
the point clean through  his chest.
He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the
cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked
soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging
the servants. Duncan  is shoved through the door.
                       DUNCAN
         I am sorry, my lady.    There were
         too many.
She stares at the invaders with studied calm.
                       MARIAN
         Is there something you need,
         gentlemen? I remember no masked
         ball on my calendar.

AERIAL SHOT
FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an expanse of green,
intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING
AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in...

                                                      86.
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - NIGHT
The Sheriff and SIX BARONS are gathered around the model.
These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord
Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with
a white rat on his arm.
                       REDHEAD BARON
         Forget about Locksley. He is no
         threat.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         How can we control all England if
         we cannot control our own county?
         The people are turning him into
         a hero.

                       GREYBEARD BARON
         It is impossible to attack him
         in the forest. We have tried
         everything. He is cunning.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Then we   will be more cunning. I
         must be   rid of him. We may not
         be able   to intercept his next
         warning   to the King.
Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open.
Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor.
His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the
visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable
ferocity in his eyes.
                       CELTIC CHIEFTAIN
         I want the heads of the men who
         stole my gold.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Welcome, sir. We were discussing
         how to rid ourselves of those very
         men. The outlaws who band with
         Robin Hood.
                       REDHEAD BARON
         My Lord Nottingham, I must protest.
         It is a mistake to ally ourselves
         with foreigners.
                       GREYBEARD BARON
         What can these Celts do that we
         cannot?

CONTINUED:
The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a
burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log
spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head...
and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking
at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full
three seconds.
An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the
demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         This rat Hood has hidden out in
         the forest.  He resists all our
         assaults with traps and devices,
         while he robs us blind. We must
         bring him out and destroy him.
The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees.
The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches
the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT
SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its
escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and
again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - NIGHT
The campfire. Aslan shrieks a war cry.   Dervishes 'round
the fire, swigging from a jug. Equally  drunk, the Friar
follows, howling, mimicking him. Robin  and the others
watch in amusement. Tuck scoops another  jug and hands it
to Aslan.
                       FRIAR
         Come, you son of Saladin. A toast
         to all of Jehovah's children. The
         saved and the damned.
                       ASLAN
         This must be a truly evil potion,
         to make the soul feel this good.
He downs the entire jug in one long draught.   Refills it.
                       ASLAN
         Come, holy man. A toast to all
         of Allah's children. The true
         believers and the fat infidels.
Tuck laughs and drinks. Aslan sways and topples at the
Friar's feet. Heaves up all over the holy sandals. Tuck
looks at Robin.

A masked soldier gallops along.    Hurls a bundle to the

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAWN

The Friar and the Saracen lie head to head on the dewey
grass. Tuck  snores. Robin shakes Aslan, who grabs for
his weapon.  The hangover hits him like a mallet. He
clutches his temples.
                       ROBIN
         The dancing demon! Good morning.
                       ASLAN
                (wincing)
         If it was Jehovah who created this
         brew, he is truly wise. He built
         the punishment into the crime.
An ARROW WHISTLES into a tree.    Robin reacts.
                       ROBIN
         They need help.


EXT. FOREST LANE - DAY
Bull and Hal are crouched in the roadway, over a body.
Robin runs up with Aslan. He kneels beside them. The
body is Duncan. Robin clasps a dead hand... Silence.
Fighting his emotions.
                       BULL
         A bloke wearin' a mask o' the
         Druids rode by. Tossed 'im down.

EXT. CAVES
SQUAWKING ominously, CROWS burst from the trees. Robin
rides up the path to the caves that his father took.
Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves
cautiously forward.


POV THROUGH SCOPE - CIRCLE OF STONES
No one visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes.
Remnants of a recent ceremony.

BACK TO SCENE
Robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone
circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar.
Through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form,
lying face down.
                       ROBIN
                (under his breath)

He runs forward. Turns the body over. Skin chalk-white
from loss of blood... Sarah! A shadow falls across
Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into
blackness.

INT. CAVE - DAY
Robin's eyes  -- he wakes. Squints around him, the dark
smoke-filled  recesses of the caves. The walls weave.
Eerie WATERY  sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men.
He tries to  stand.
                       VOICE (O.S.)
         Robin!... Robin!

A figure in a flowing white robe. Angelic. Floating
towards him... Marian. He tries to speak her name.
Reaches out his hand.
                       MARIAN
         Death is not to be feared,
         Robin. Embrace it.
Her LAUGH ECHOES around the cave, as if hundreds of lost
souls are laughing with her. Robin crawls away, cover-
ing his ears. Marian lifts his face to hers.
                        MARIAN
         Drink this.
Weakly, Robin tries to push away the cup.   Her hand
grips his chin, forcing his mouth open.
                        MARIAN
         Drink.

The liquid trickles over his lips. He tries to focus.
Her features are BLURRED, her voice hypnotic.
                       MARIAN
         Look at me. Listen to me. You
         belong to me. Your soul is mine.
         You will obey my every word. Do
         you understand?
Her face is inches from his. He tries to pull away, his
subconscious sounding alarms.

         Why, Marian?

         I love you.
                       MARIAN
         Kiss me.
He gives himself to her. Their lips meet... something
changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face
starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of
Mortianna.
He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his
head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision,
we see he is surrounded by masked men.
                       ROBIN
                (slurred)
         Where is Marian?
                       MORTIANNA
         She is with friends.
                (cackles)
         Your resistence is strong, but
         useless. Sign this.
                (as quill is forced
                 into his hand)
         You are a Druid like your father.
         You consort with the devil. Your
         confession will be witnessed by
         the Bishop of Hereford.
A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then
cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be-
tween his shoulders.
In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling
beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan.
                       MORTIANNA
                (horror)
         The painted man!
Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A    curved
scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in   the
other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked    guards
are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats,    scurry-
ing into the depths of the cave.

CONTINUED:
Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling
in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf
stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy.
A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like
hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only
two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark-
ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his
feet... and lunges.
                          ASLAN
         Behind you!
Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan
grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into
the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks.
Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's.
Robin is slumped against a rock.
                       ROBIN
                (groggy)
         Marian?
Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is
crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.
                       BULL
         Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian
         burial. Promise me, boy.
                          WULF
         I promise.
Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be-
low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock.
For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom,
hatred, fear -- then is gone.

EXT. GREGOR CAVES - DAY
Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering,
glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks
the light from his eyes.
                       ASLAN
         They have poisoned you. There
         are herbs that can alter a man's
         brain. I know of only one cure.
He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the
other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers
down his throat.

         You will thank me for this later.

EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY
Distant THUNDER. Three horses. First Wulf's, leading
another with the bodies of Bull and Sarah draped across
its back. Aslan rides the third, with Robin propped up
in front of him.
                       ROBIN
         You have fulfilled your vow.   Now
         you can leave.
                       ASLAN
         Your gratitude warms my heart.
                       ROBIN
         You ignored my request.
                       ASLAN
         It is fortunate that I did.
                       ROBIN
         Because of you, another good man
         is dead.
                       ASLAN
         He urged me to bring him. He was
         a brave man and I grieve for him.
         Praise be to Allah that I do not
         grieve for you also. Or for my
         broken vow.
                       ROBIN
         To hell with your damn vow.
                       ASLAN
         I am glad you are feeling
         better.
Ahead of them, Wulf shouts and reins in. He points into
the distance. A huge cloud of smoke is darkening the
sky.
                        ROBIN
         The forest!   Ride!

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
Fire.   Blazing rampant.
Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire
arrows. At a shouted order, another wave of flaming
arrows ignites the trees.
Behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback.
One is the Sheriff, in full armor. The other is the
black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as still as a rock.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
Chaos. Acrid black smoke pours across the clearing.
Disarray. COUGHING, SCREAMING, confusion. Little John
vainly attempts to instill calm.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke
          ain't gonna kill ya.
Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees.
Full retreat.
                        WILL SCARLET
                 (running up)
          It's burning for miles, John.
          It's hotter than hades, and them
          damn screens ain't worth nothing.
Two woodsmen, blinded and choking, stumble into one of
their own camouflaged pits. Hideous screams as they're
impaled on hidden stakes. John tries to gather the able-
bodied men to his side.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must
          make a stand.
Most of them keep on running.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          Damn y'all! Ya're no more use
          than a load o' wet farts.
                        WILL SCARLET
          Where's that damn Locksley?   I'll
          swear he betrayed us.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          Bollocks, Will. Quit yer bloody
          bellyachin'.
Hal runs to join them, stuttering.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                    95.

         Celts?   Where?
                       HAL
                (pointing behind
                 him)
         Gggg... God help us.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
Celts, arrayed behind their Chieftain. An awesome sight.
Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head-
pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie
silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up
to the Chieftain.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         I want prisoners.
The Chieftain does not turn his head.
                       CHIEFTAIN
         We came to fight.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Nevertheless, I need prisoners.
With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits.
Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol-
diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword.
Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors.
They charge forward.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
The bloodcurdling cry fills the sky. Amidst the smoke
and chaos, Little John's small band is gathered at the
edge of the clearing.
                       WILL SCARLET
         What are we gonna do, John?

         Stop 'ere and flippin' well fight
         'em, that's what. Whadya say,
         lads?
Half-hearted support from about a dozen men, including
Tack.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin'
         wi' the wenches.
                       FRIAR
         This holy man believes in doing
         God's work with his hands.

He snatches a quarterstaff.    John slaps him on the back.
The men are encouraged.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Let's give 'em a bloody good
         wallopin' an' all, lads.

EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
Aslan reins in. In the valley below, the forest is
ablaze. The Sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em-
battled woodsmen.
                       ROBIN
         Wulf, stay here. I need your
         horse.
He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart
of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.

                       ROBIN
         What are you doing?    Out of my
         way!
                       ASLAN
         I saved your life. I will not
         let you give it away for no
         purpose.
                       ROBIN
         Out of my way, damn you!
                       ASLAN
         Does the witch still have
         possession of your senses? If
         we meet up with the survivors we
         may yet give them some help. And
         do some damage to the enemy.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                      97.
CONTINUED:
Robin debates.   Relents.   They urge their horses into
a gallop.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
The Sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest.
From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's
men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat,
turn and fire again.
They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries
charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen
drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are
being decimated.

Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy,
inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant.
Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt.
                       FRIAR
         Surely you would not harm a man
         of the cloth?
The man swings, Tuck sidesteps.
                        FRIAR
         You would?   Then to hellfire with
         you.
He pummels the man to the ground with his staff.
The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group,
including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others
fight on.

Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded
by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out
expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his
attackers are hurled aside. Robin rides right through
them, slashing with his sword.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         'Bout bleedin' time, mush.
Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver-
ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck
glances heavenwards.
                       FRIAR
         Thank you, Lord.
                (an afterthought)
         And thank you, Allah.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                      98.
CONTINUED:
Aslan is a   wild man. Steering his horse with just legs
and knees,   he strikes out with both swords to left and
right. The    momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the
edge of the   clearing. Starts picking off stragglers.
His father   spots him.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there,
         ya li'l bugger.
Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back...
but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He
freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet.
When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by
three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but
is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down.
Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down
with both swords. Both men topple to the ground
simultaneously.
Suddenly all is quiet.    The smoking clearing is a mass
of fallen bodies. Only    four men seem to be alive.
Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who   is slouched against a tree
gasping for breath, and   Hal, who kneels clutching his
wounded shoulder.
Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed
and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Don't 'ee start bleedin'
         blubberin', or ya'll make me
         bloody vomit.

Robin manages a relieved smile. Aslan strides over.
All around them lie slain Celts and woodsmen.
                       ASLAN
         It was a fiendish mind that
         planned this campaign.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DUSK
A shovel breaks dirt. Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a
grave. The clearing is transformed into a cemetery.
Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags
a Celt's corpse into a grave. Throws the man's armor
and weapons into a growing pile.
                                            (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
         You were an honor to your
         countrymen today, Aslan. You
         fought better than twenty
         English knights.
                       ASLAN
         This war is the God of Abraham
         against the forces of evil.
                       ROBIN
         Well, the war is over.
He stares across the desolate clearing.

                       ROBIN
         There is too much blood on my
         hands.

INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - NIGHT
A heavy key turns in a lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol-
lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the torture chamber
where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them
Wulf and Will Scarlet. Putrid ankle-deep water on the
floor, walls encrusted with dried blood and grime.
Nottingham walks up to the FIRST MAN. Wry smile.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (wry smile)
         Would you prefer pain or death?
                        FIRST WOODSMAN
         Death.

Dignity masking his terror.    Nottingham appears to
consider.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         Torture him.
The man is dragged away by guards.    The next PRISONER --
                        NOTTINGHAM
         And you?   Pain or death?
                       SECOND WOODSMAN (PRISONER)
                (pure terror)
         ... Er... pain.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Torture him... you see, it makes
         no difference.

                       NOTTINGHAM (CONT'D)
         You will all be tortured. You will
         all tell me all you know about
         Robin Hood, and then you will all
         be hanged. Then we will catch your
         beloved Robin Hood and do the same
         to him.
                       WILL SCARLET
         I will kill him for you.
                          WULF
         Will, no!
Nottingham strides up to Will, drawing his sword.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Why would I need you?
                       WILL SCARLET
         All your attempts to kill him
         have failed. Your army failed.
         Your Celtic mercenaries failed.
Nottingham places his sword point against Will's throat.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         And you can succeed?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I am one of his men. He would
         never suspect me.
                       WULF
         He knows you always hated him,
         traitor.

                       WILL SCARLET
         He is a trusting fool. He will
         believe me. If he doesn't, he
         will kill me and you have lost
         nothing.
Nottingham slides his blade between Will's teeth.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         If you fail, I will personally
         cut out your lying tongue.
He withdraws the blade.    Will tries to smile.
                       WILL SCARLET
         And if I succeed?
                                            (CONTINUED)

         His friends will..

         ... torture him!
He turns back to Will.   A smile of mock apology.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         It will look better.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
A winter's night. Bitterly    cold.  Sad figures huddled
around a small fire. Fanny    tends to John's wounds, their
little ones asleep by their   feet.  John drinks and passes
the jug to Tuck, who numbly   shakes his head. Too
depressed even to drink.
Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who
sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.
                       ROBIN
         My pride brought us to this.
                       ASLAN
         No, friend. It was you who gave
         these men pride.
                       ROBIN
         I gave them nothing but false
         hope. Tomorrow we will disperse.
         These people can move south and
         start over. You must go home and
         win your Jasmina.

                         ASLAN
         And you?
                       ROBIN
         I am no longer your responsibility.
                       ASLAN
         That is for me to decide.
                       ROBIN
                (raging)
         Damn you, Arab. I want you out of
         my life. Can't you understand
         that? Go home. Go back to your
         own kind.
Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for
argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips
it from his neck.

                       ROBIN
         Damn you, too, Father.   You reared
         a coward and a fool.
He hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging
branch.
                                            CUT TO:

NOVEMBER MOON
Watery, full. The FOCUS SHIFTS TO the medallion,
dangling in its center... the last thing Robin sees
before his eyes close into troubled sleep. The white
moon against the black sky...
                                            DISSOLVE TO:

ITS NEGATIVE IMAGE
-- a black circle against a white sky. An executioner.
The round medallion has become a noose.
In the noose appears Wulf's face. The executioner hauls
on the rope and Wulf's features contort in the agony of
death. Another noose, another face... Duncan. Another
-- Bull. Another -- Marian.
                       MARIAN
         Kiss me, Robin.
The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face
shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna.

Next, Robin's father.   He stares accusingly right AT us.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Why have you betrayed me?   Why?
Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his
hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope.
His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous
cacophony.
                                            DISSOLVE TO:

ROBIN'S FACE
DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER BECOMES the sound of
a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive away
the horror.

CONTINUED:
The first streaks of light fight their way through a
thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure,
at first indecipherable. Aware of his presence,
Robin looks up.
                         ROBIN
         Will!    I thought you were taken.
                         WILL SCARLET
         I was.
                       ROBIN
         How did you escape?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I promised to kill you.
                         ROBIN
         And will you?
Before Will can answer, Little John runs up.     Grabs
Will's throat.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will
         Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a
         bloody favor an' all.
Quickly, others arrive. Aslan, Tuck, Hal, Fanny, with
kids clinging to her skirts.
                       FANNY
         Afore ya kill 'im, John, ask 'im
         if Wulf be still alive.
Will is choking, unable to speak. John loosens his hold
just enough for Will to splutter out...
                         WILL SCARLET
         Y... e...
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Git us a rope, Hal, and we'll put

         misery.
                         ROBIN
         John, wait.    Let us hear what he
         has to say.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff,

         A traitor sneaks in and out under
         cover of darkness. Will walked in
         and announced himself.
                         LITTLE JOHN

John reluctantly moves his hold from Will's neck to his
shoulders.

         Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a

Will eyes the accusing faces. Hal searches, lifts Will's
shirt. His whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and
fresh burns.
                         LITTLE JOHN
         Bugger me.
He steps back.    Ready to listen.
                       WILL SCARLET
         I bring a message from Nottingham.
         Our men are to be hung in the
         square on Saturday. At high noon.

                       FANNY
         What about my boy?
                         WILL SCARLET
         The boy, too.    Ten men in all.
Fanny drops her head on John's shoulder.
                         WILL SCARLET
         Their   deaths are a warning.
         Anyone   who associates with the
         outlaw   Hood is to suffer the same
         fate.    Man, woman, or child. Even
         anyone   who so much as utters his
         name.

         Robin Hood! Robin Hood! Robin
         Hood!
                (chuckles)
         May as well be hung for a sheep as
         a lamb.
                       WILL SCARLET
         The hangings are to be part of the
         celebration for the Sheriff's
         marriage.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Marriage, eh? What lucky wench
         gits to play with the Sheriff's
         codpiece?
Will turns his gaze directly on Robin.
                        WILL SCARLET
         Lady Marian.
                       FRIAR
         He takes a bride of royal blood?
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Aye, and then with King Richard
         gone, he takes the bloody throne.
Everyone reacts with shock.     Only Robin appears unsur-
prised.
                       ROBIN
         You were to use this news to get
         close to me, and then kill me?
         Right, Will?

                       WILL SCARLET
                (sly grin)
         Not straightway, of course.
                       ROBIN
         What is your intention, Will?
                       WILL SCARLET
         That depends on you, Locksley.
                        ROBIN
         How so?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I've never trusted you, that's no
         secret. What I wanna know is, are
         you gonna finish what you started?

Robin is on the spot.    All eyes on him.   Will presses his
point.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Will ya stay and keep us fightin'
         till every man jack of us is dead?
         Or will you run like the spoiled
         little rich boy I always took you
         for?
                       ROBIN
         You present quite a choice.    What
         would you have me do, Will?
                       WILL SCARLET
         If you run, I will kill you.
                       ROBIN
         And if I stay, will you all stay
         with me?
Robin checks the other faces.
                       ASLAN
         To the end, friend.
                       FRIAR
         If my heathen brother stays, I
         stay.
                       HAL
         Mmmm... meee... tttt...
He can't get it out.    Little John covers Hal's mouth.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         'E's in. We're all bloody in.
         Daft buggers.
                       ROBIN
         There's your answer, Will.    We
         finish it.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM TOWN SQUARE - DUSK
Ten gallows, silhouetted against the setting sun. The
black-armored Celt tests a gallows, springing the hatch.
A heavy sack dangles from the rope. Grim-faced peasants
watch. Among  them -- Fanny Little.

                                                        107.
INT. DUNGEON - DUSK
The sound of the gallows ECHOES inside the damp, stone
walls. Wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to rings
in the floor. Wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light
high in the wall. The purple sky is turning black. He
fingers his wooden crucifix.
                         WULF
           If it be your biddin' that this be
           my last night o' life, Lord, gimme
           the pluck to die proud. An' look
           'ee kindly on my folks an' the
           young 'uns.
The light in the cell melts to total darkness.

CHIRPS.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAWN
In the troubled human realm, Tuck says his morning
prayer.
                         FRIAR
           Lord, grant us the courage to
           endure, and if you're as smart as
           I believe you are, grant us
           victory... and the victuals to
           celebrate it with.

Aslan is crushing charcoal into a mixture of yellow
powder, which is turning black. Tuck approaches.
                         FRIAR
           Will you pray with me, son of
           Allah?
                         ASLAN
           I have prayed for you, often, my
           brother. But, let us put prayer
           aside and help our gods in a more
           practical manner. I must reveal
           to you the mysteries of the black
           powder.
Tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to
examine it. Aslan snatches it back... Before Tuck can
react, Robin walks up.

         Will it work?
Aslan throws a handful of powder into the firel A fire-
ball rips ten feet in the air... Tuck falls on his ass
in terror.
                       ROBIN
                (impressed)
         You are truly a wizard.
                       ASLAN
         There is no such thing. But if
         there was...
                (chuckles)
         ... I would surely be one.
Robin reaches out and shakes Aslan's hand. A moment of
bonding. He moves on to the others, clasping each man's
hand as he speaks.
                       ROBIN
         We have no armored knights, no
         glorious banners. But I am
         honored to be going to battle in
         this company. Today we fight not
         just for the lives of our friends,
         but to save all England.
A moment of tension before Will takes the proferred hand.
                       ROBIN
         We may be only six men, but...
                         FANNY
         Seven!

She strides towards them from the trees.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         What in blazes ya doin', woman?
         Where's the little 'uns?

                 John)
         Robin, I been to town an' seen the
         scaffold and the guard towers.

Robin starts to draw a diagram on the ground with a
stick.
                       ROBIN
         Fanny, show me the exact location
         of the scaffold.
Little John double-takes.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM - DAY
The gallows. Swathed in a pink glow. A brilliant,
wintry morning. Breath billows from the mouths of the
sentries.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - CORRIDOR - DAY
Boots clack confidently down a stone corridor. The
Sheriff decked in wedding finery. He enters...

INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY

... Mortianna's apothecary. Dark, smoke-filled. Foul
things in jars. Animals in cages, waiting to meet
unspeakable ends. Marian is strapped in a chair, flanked
by two armed guards.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         How is my bride?
Marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his
face.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Ah... You are overwhelmed with
         happiness.
He slowly wipes off the spittle... and slaps her hard.

                (calm, uncowed)
         I will never marry you.
Mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet
she used at the Druid ceremony.
                       MORTIANNA
         Hold her!
Marian struggles against her bonds.
                       MARIAN
         Get away from me, you disgusting
         hag. I will not... augh!

The guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth
open. Mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her
throat. Marian fights, gagging and choking... until the
drug takes its effect. She slumps forward. Nottingham
watches with amusement.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (to Mortianna)
         When we are married, thirty of the
         northern barons will pledge me
         their support as king. As you
         predicted.
Mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood.
Clasps the dice-like runes.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What do you see in the portents?
Mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands
to her sides. She chants, fingering the bloody stones.
                       MORTIANNA
         The union. The blood of the lion
         and the house of Nottingham. New
         faith. New power. New souls.
She stares at Nottingham, her red eyes demented.
                       MORTIANNA
         If there is no union, there will
         be darkness, despair, death.
         Ours!
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Di not give me riddles, woman. We
         are to be married within hours.
         How can we be in danger?

                (shouting)
         Tell me how it will result.
                       MORTIANNA
         I have told you what I know.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Confound you, crone. Without my
         protection, the people would hunt
         you down, rip out your black heart
         and burn it.

Mortianna runs at him.   Points her bony finger at his
heart.
                       MORTIANNA
         Without me, you are nothing. You
         are straw, a fleabite, a speck.
                (as Nottingham
                 laughs)
         Laugh, fool. I birthed you from
         this body. I stole a babe in this
         very castle, and killed it so that
         you might rise in its place. You
         are my son.
                (Nottingham is
                 too shocked to
                 react)
         Together we are strong. Now is
         not the time to doubt. Now is the
         time to believe, to be bold. The
         bold will prevail.


EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
Masses stream in. They give wide berth to a Celtic war-
rior in a boar's head helmet. Soldiers prod and harness
the passing peasants. Tuck drives a cartload of barrels.
A GUARD stops him.
                       GUARD
         What you got there, Father?
                       FRIAR

EXT. DUNGEON GATE - DAY
Wulf blinks at the sunlight as the prisoners are led out.
Holds his head high. Soldiers hurl abuse, the people are
too cowed to show support. Fanny glances at her son,
crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed.
On horseback, encircled by guards, the Sheriff and his
baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel
amusement. A  yell attracts Nottingham. Will is being
shoved back by guards.
                      WILL SCARLET
         Sheriff! My Lord Sheriff! I have
         word for you! Of Robin Hood!
Nottingham shouts to one of his mounted guards, who rides
over, grabs Will by the collar, and drags him to his
side.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I found his lair, but alas he still
         lives.
The Sheriff strikes down with his armored hand.    Will
crumples.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Stretch his neck with the others.
Hands yank Will to his feet. Dazed, he tries to speak.
Disinterested, Nottingham turns away, until he catches...
                       WILL SCARLET
         ...He... He... is here!
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Locksley, here? Where ?
Will struggles to get free of his holders.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Call off your dogs.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Release him!... Now, where is he?

                       WILL SCARLET
         I want your word, in front of
         these witnesses. If I tell you,
         I will go free.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (scoffs)
         We will find him.
                       WILL SCARLET
         He is concealed. He is going to
         free the prisoners and stop the
         wedding.
Nottingham's jaw tightens.   Eyes the prisoners, the
scaffold.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Put Hood in my hands, you go free.
                       WILL SCARLET
         With the reward. Ten thousand
         crowns.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Damn your worthless hide!    Just
         tell me where he is.
                       WILL SCARLET
         The reward!
The parade of prisoners reaches them. Seeing Will, Wulf
charges at him, screaming in blind rage. Soldiers grab
Wulf. Throw him down, kicking and beating. Voices in
the crowd plead to let him be. Someone tries to
intervene, gets hurled down.

                       NOTTINGHAM
                (to Will)
         You'll get your reward. Where

EXT. SCAFFOLD
Tuck urges his ancient nag towards the scaffold with his
cargo of barrels. The crowd parts unwillingly.
                       FRIAR
         Out of the way. Make way for
         the Lord's business.

Across the square, Will points urgently in Tuck's
direction.

EXT. CITY WALL - DAY
A massive oak stands near the southern wall. A large
figure climbs to its uppermost branches. Little John.
He scrambles from the tree, starts to climb the wall
itself. He slips frequently.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
The prisoners are led to the scaffold, where the hooded
executioner waits, along with the Chieftain. Wulf
staggers, from his beating.
Nottingham's men encircle Tuck's cart.    He watches them
nervously.

EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
Fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement. Far
below, John clings to the outer wall. Above him it's
sheer, without footholds. The rope doesn't reach his
fingertips. He stretches, loses balance. Falls...
desperately grabbing at the rope. He swings, clinging
by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Will leads the Sheriff to Tuck's cart.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Step down, friar.
                       FRIAR
         As you wish, sire. Is there
         something amiss?
                       NOTTINGHAM
         This man claims you have outlaws
         concealed in these barrels. Among
         them the cursed Robin Hood.
Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred.
                       FRIAR
         This man will rot in hell as a
         knave and a liar. These are
         libations for the celebration
         of your lordship's nuptials.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Break one open!
                       FRIAR
                (nervous)
         Why waste fine vintage, my lord?
A cask is shattered... wine torrents out.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Try another. There are many
         barrels, only a few outlaws.
A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the
scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the
steps -- Wulf.
Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes
a flame.

EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He
nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks
the man's view.
                       SENTRY
         What is your business, woman?
                       FANNY
         Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear.
         Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly
         view up 'ere, ain't it?
She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to
her... notices the rope. With all her might, Fanny rams
his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times.
He slumps unconscious.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the
noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who
is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head
bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree-
branch crutch.
                       WOUNDED SOLDIER
         Give room for a fightin' man and
         his ma. Step aside, or I'll make
         ya. I wanna see the bastards walk
         on air.

                                                       116.
EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
John struggles over the battlement.   Collapses.
                       FANNY
         'Bout time, ya gurt lug.
She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an
arrow.
                       FANNY
         We be too late.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain
guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround
the base.
The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose.
SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the
barrels.
A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow.
The executioner's eyes glint through the slits.
Nottingham intently watches Wulf.
The Chieftain stands, impassive.
Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns.
Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.   His eyes close.
An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye
slit.
The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but
the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap.
Wulf's body plunges.   The rope snaps tight.
Little John yells.   Fanny screams.
A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier
throws aside his crutch... Robin!
Wulf dangles, strangling.   His hands wrench at the
choking cord.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                      117.
CONTINUED:
The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the
smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting
it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his
effort to escape.
The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked...
by the Celt with the boar's head.
KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing
smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass
confusion.
Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's
rope. He hauls him onto the platform.

Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes
the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig...
It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his
arm.
                       HAL
         Here... By God... Let's fight 'em!
                      WOODSMAN
         Hal! What happened to your
         stutter?
                       HAL
         It's gg... ggg... g..oh crap!
A guard attacks, Hal fells him.
                       HAL
         Take that, ya mug.
No stutter this time!    The woodsmen join battle with the
guards.
The Chieftain cudgels his Celt attacker across the head.
The boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing Aslan.
                        CHIEFTAIN
         Impostor!   You dishonor the clan.
Aslan retreats, fending off the Chieftain's shattering
blows.

FROM PARAPET
John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch
Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him.
                         LITTLE JOHN
         Fight fair...
                                            (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
He aims.   Grits his teeth... picks off the Celt with a
shaft.
                         LITTLE JOHN
           ...Or don't fight at all.

ON SCENE
Robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking
out, slashing down. Sends two Celts hurtling down the
trap hole.
Will battles the Sheriff. A reprise of his own fight
with Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and
mounted, flails at Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and
around the horse's legs.
Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat.
Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at
his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood.
Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL... It
EXPLODES.
The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the
parapet.
                          GREYBEARD BARON
           Up there!   No mercy, shoot them!
Crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire.      Bolts ricochet
all around Little John and Fanny.

ON SCAFFOLD

Wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.

ON SCENE
Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a
soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the
Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black
armor.
The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking
Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will
grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war.
Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in.
He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his
horse. Will leaps on him.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                       119.
CONTINUED:
                       WILL SCARLET
         Pain or death, you butcher?
The Sheriff's men drag Will off before he can choke him.
Raging, Nottingham climbs to his feet. Will is held by
four men.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Here's another message to Robin
         Hood, written in your blood.
He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's
belly.
                       WILL SCARLET
         It's over, fool. You can kill my
         body, but you cannot kill our
         spirit.
He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle.
Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose,
using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers.
As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his
men.
                        REDHEAD BARON
         It's Hood!   Get him!
The Chieftain knocks Aslan down.   Aslan loses his sword.
                        CHIEFTAIN
         I am iron.   I am rock. I am your
         death.
Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead
Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out.
                       ASLAN
         You talk too much!
He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's
mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain
grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples,
his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck.
Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.
                       ASLAN
         Englishmen! I am not one of you,
         yet I fight for you. Against a
         tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin
         Hood.
The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen
soldiers, many join the fray.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                      120.
CONTINUED:
Nottingham runs through the castle gate.   Angry peasants
pursue.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Lower the portcullis! Now!
A guard winds down the giant gate.   Nottingham hurls him
aside.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Too slow, fool!
He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a
guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.

Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees   with dismay
that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he    staves off
the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly    peasants
are swarming over his attacker. The baron is    dragged off
and trampled down.
                        ROBIN
         Friends!   We must raise the gate.

EXT. CASTLE PARAPET - DAY
Crossbow bolts fly. Little John ducks and weaves, while
spinning and firing at the men advancing at him from both
sides.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers.
         Ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies.
He can't shoot fast enough. As they descend on him, he
leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. Grabs
his sword.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind
         if I borrow this?
He's backed up against a battlement, outnumbered five to
one.

EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY
Robin and the others try in vain to lift the portcullis.
INT. CASTLE - MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY
The Sheriff marches through, issuing orders.

INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY
Surrounded by flickering candles, Marian sits before a
mirror. In a white wedding gown. Her eyes faraway,
lifeless, in deep trance. Mortianna sensuously combs
the bride's hair with her taloned fingers. The
Sheriff's face appears in the reflection.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         Come!   It is time for the union.
The guards roughly haul Marian to her feet.    She is
oblivious.

INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Once, Christian, now blasphemously transformed   to the
practice of black magic. The crucifix on the    altar is
upside down. Marian stands before it, between    the
Sheriff and Mortianna. The Bishop is dragged    in.
Frightened. The BATTLE SOUNDS ECHO.
                       BISHOP
         They are rebelling. We must
         escape.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Marry us. When I am declared king,
         that rabble will not dare go against
         us.
                       BISHOP
         Is is madness to delay.
Mortianna screams and slashes her talons across the
Bishop's outstretched hands. Blood flows.
                       MORTIANNA
         Face them, or face me.

EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY
Robin leaps onto Tuck's cart.
                       ROBIN
         Light all the barrels, Tuck.

Robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across
the yard. Bouncing in the back, Tuck lights barrels.
FUSES smoke and CRACKLE.
                       ROBIN
         Jump!
Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the
last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the
horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is
blown to kingdom come.
Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger.
Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.


INT. CASTLE KITCHENS - DAY
Fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier.
He grabs her and pushes her into the open cooking fire.
Desperate, she grabs a poker and smashes him over the
head. The servants stare in shock... A chef comes at
Fanny with a knife.

EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY
Hal and the others battle against huge odds. More
peasants join them, daring to take on the Sheriff's hated
men. Aslan's a whirlwind,  striking out in all
directions. Each blow for  a cause.
                       ASLAN
         For Allah!... For Jehovah!
         For brotherhood!... For
         justice!


INT. CASTLE HALLWAYS - DAY
A door SLAMS back. Robin bursts through. Alone, against
three attackers. He swings a soldier around. Holds him
as a shield, using the man's own sword against his
companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is
off and running.
Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants
converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings
statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down
on his pursuers.
                       ROBIN
                (grabbing a servant)
         Where is she? Where is Lady

The man refuses to speak. Robin looks up the corridor,
sees six men guarding the private chapel's arched door-
way.
                        ROBIN
         Ah!   There is my answer.
He hurls the man aside... The armed guards charge him.

INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
Carrying a flaming torch, Tuck runs down the dark passage-
ways. Before him, an awesome sight... dozens of pitiful
men in cages. Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer.
A cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club.
                       FRIAR
                (pious)
         My son, there is a holy war being
         waged outside. Release all these
         wretches and God shall surely find
         you a place in heaven.
                       JAILER
         I'd rather go to hell!
WHAM! Tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest.
Flies back.

INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Sweating, fearful, the Bishop rushes through the service.
                       BISHOP
         ...your bodies to be bound in
         immortal wedlock. Do you, Marian
         Dubois, take...
The chapel DOORS SHATTER inward.
Robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining
soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into
him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another
pew, taking down a third.
                        ROBIN
         Marian, run!   It's me, Robin.
         Run!
Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side.
Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the
Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin
prepares to fight him.
                                          (CONTINUED)

         I warned you, I would find you no
         matter what.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         No companions? No army? You rush
         to your death for the sake of a
         woman. Lust has turned you into a
         fool... Recognize this, Locksley?
He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix
sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Appropriate I should use it to
         kill you with, don't you think?
He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire
in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying
desperately.

INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
Tuck picks himself up from the floor.    The jailer is
amazed.
                       FRIAR
         The Lord helps those who help
         themselves.
Grinning, he pulls open his robes, revealing chest armor
... and a miniature powder keg. He holds it to his
flaming torch and tosses it to the jailer... Stupified,
the man catches the smoking bomb.

                       FRIAR
         Give my regards to the devil.
The KEG ERUPTS, blowing the jailer through a wall.

Wulf sends an attacker plummeting off the parapet.

EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY

A crossbow bolt strikes Hal between his shoulder blades.
He falls. The Sheriff's soldiers are regaining the
advantage. The peasants are giving up, dropping their
weapons.
                        HAL
         No!   Fight on. Fight!
He sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards
him. Tuck leading a barefoot army. Dozens of ragged
prisoners, armed with chains and torture implements.
                       FRIAR
         Sinners, beware! God's avengers
         are at hand.
Dying, Hal manages a weak smile.

Tuck flails a chain at a Celt.

         Repent, heathen!
The man spins to strike back... freezes... grinning...
Aslan!

         Turn that on the Sheriff and his
         bullies.
A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding
cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying
food and cutlery.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY

A full-scale riot. The populace has turned. Into the
fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants
and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms,
knives, hooks, and bedpans.

INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - DAY
Nottingham slashes maniacally.   Robin is cornered,
weakening.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You should have stayed away,
         Locksley. Fools like you never

A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his
grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back
to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan,
followed by Tuck.

                         ASLAN
         Ali akbar!
                         FRIAR
         Amen!
                       MORTIANNA
                (seeing Aslan)
         Agh... the painted one!
Nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!...
Robin lashes out. Kicks the Sheriff in the gut, chops
down his sword hand. His father's sword clatters to the
floor.
Whirling swords in each hand, Aslan attacks the other
men. Robin pile-drives Nottingham into the wall.
                                            (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
The Bishop makes his escape.    Tuck blocks his path.
                      FRIAR
         So! You sold your soul to the
         devil?
                       BISHOP
         No, I swear it, in God's name.
                       FRIAR
         Blasphemer! You accuse innocent
         men of Druid worship while you
         practice the black arts yourself.
The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes.

A taloned hand grips a spear... Mortianna creeps up on
Aslan.
                       ROBIN
                (glimpsing her)
         Watch out!
Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives
the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to
the floor.
Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword.
Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows.
Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot
pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet.
Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with
all his strength.
The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.

                       BISHOP
                (innocently)
         I am sure you would not strike a
         man of the cloth.
                        FRIAR
         Think again!
Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so
hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW.

EXT. CASTLE - BALCONY - DAY
Mortianna hauls Marian against the battlements. Peers
down at the battle. She spins in shock at Aslan's voice.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     128.
CONTINUED:
                          ASLAN
            What you fear is not below.
He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams
hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest.
Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all
reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it
further through her body in her effort to get at him.
Clutching, screeching, hissing.
Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the
last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle-
ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to
the ground.


INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the
altar.
                          NOTTINGHAM
            What can your puny God do for
            you now?
The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked.
Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand.
He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the
temple.  The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his
father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries
to squirm away.
                          ROBIN
            This is for my father.

He drives the sword down, like a stake, right through
Nottingham's heart. The man shudders, and is still.
Robin stands over him. Drained. Tuck rushes outside.
Kneels at Aslan's side. Robin spots Marian swaying on
the edge of the steep parapet.

EXT. CASTLE BALCONY - DAY
Robin grabs Marian, pulling her back. Carefully lifts
her face. Her lifeless eyes suddenly flash. She lashes
out. A spitfire.
                           MARIAN
            Let me go!   Who are you?
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                    129.

                       ROBIN
                (restraining her)
         I'm your sworn protector.   Any
         way I see fit.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder,
Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the
fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into
the freezing water.
She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back.
Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers,
enjoying the show.
                        MARIAN
         Robin?   Oh God, is that you?
She stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him,
pounding her fists on his chest.
                       MARIAN
         How dare you?!
Robin grins at the crowd.
                       ROBIN
         I think she's feeling better.
Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of
battle. Reality gradually sinks in. She folds against
Robin's chest.
Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and
Fanny.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         We done it, mate. We clobbered
         the buggers.
                         FANNY
         Are you 'urt?
                         ROBIN
         It will mend.
He spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of
Aslan. His smile fades. He runs over. Cradles Aslan's
head.
                       ROBIN
         Aslan, my friend.

         I'm going home the easy way,
         Robin.
                       FRIAR
                (shaking Aslan)
         You die on me, you son of satan,
         and I swear I'll bury you as a
         Christian in St. Catherine's
         Cathedral with a thousand monks
         chanting prayers for your
         miserable soul. You hear me?
                       ASLAN
                (weakly)
         I have no strength, Brother Tuck.
                       FRIAR
                (kicking him)
         A fine friend you are! By the
         grace of Allah and Jehovah we
         have won the day, and you want to
         give up the ghost. I'll pickle
         your remains in mead, lay you
         in your grave with a pig for a
         companion, and mark it with a
         cross as big as this castle.
                        ASLAN
         Please!   It hurts when I laugh.
                      FRIAR
         See. There's life in the heathen
         dog yet.
                       ROBIN
                (laughs)
         Here, Tuck. Look after him.    You
         deserve each other.
Robin stands, Marian joins him. Around them cheering
grows, till the whole crowd is in unison.
                        CROWD
         Robin Hood!   Robin Hood!

INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY
A VOICE ECHOES from the vaulted roof.   A wedding is in

                       FRIAR (O.S.)
         By the power vested in me by
         God's holy church, I now
         pronounce you husband and wife.
Tuck is performing the ceremony before the happy couple.
                       FRIAR
         You may kiss the bride.
The husband draws back the bride's veil.    Robin and
Marian. They kiss... long.
                      FRIAR
               (whispers)
         Hurry. We waste good celebration
         time.
They break   the embrace, turn to the congregation and
start down   the aisle. They pause at the front pew,
where KING   RICHARD and members of his court are sitting.
Robin bows,   Marian curtsies.
                       KING RICHARD
         May I kiss the bride?
                       ROBIN
         Who would dare refuse his king's
         request?
                       KING RICHARD
                (kissing Marian's
                 cheek)
         You look radiant, cousin.
                       ROBIN
         We are deeply honored by Your
         Majesty's presence.
                       KING RICHARD
         It is I who am honored, Lord
         Locksley. Thanks to you I still
         have a throne.
They continue down the aisle, past the smiling congre-
gation. Waiting by the door is Aslan. He and Robin
embrace.
                       ASLAN
                (whispers)
         My friend, a word of advice...
         Ride her better than your horse.
Robin laughs.

          EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed.
          They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small
          wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The
          tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk
          about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.

          GIRL
          Now that the war's over, our
          soldiers get to come home, yes?

          TEACHER
          Some of them. Some will be
          stationed on the rim planets as
          Peace Enforcers.

          BOY
          I don't understand. Why were the
          Independents even fighting us?
          Why wouldn't they look to be more
          civilized?

          TEACHER
          That's a good question. Does
          anybody want to open on that?

          GIRL
          I hear they're cannibals.

          ANOTHER BOY
          That's only Reavers.

          ANOTHER GIRL
          Reavers aren't real.

          ANOTHER BOY
          Full well they are. They attack
          settlers from space, they kill
          them and wear their skins and rape
          them for hours and hours --

          TEACHER
          (in Chinese)
          

          (CALMER)
          It's true that there are...
          dangers on the outer planets. So
          let's follow up on Borodin's
          question. With all the social and
          medical advancements we can bring
          to the Independents, why would
          they fight so hard against us?

          RIVER
          We meddle.

          TEACHER
          River? 
          RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
          and "typing" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a
          long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
          columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is
          a good two years younger than the other kids.

          RIVER
          People don't like to be meddled
          with. We tell them what to do,
          what to think, don't run don't
          walk we're in their homes and in
          their heads and we haven't the
          right. We're meddlesome.

          TEACHER
          (gently taking her

          STYLUS)
          River, we're not telling people
          what to think. We're just trying
          to show them how.
          She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead

          INT. LAB - NIGHT

           And we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER
          sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one
          right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
          technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.
          The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.

          2ND TECHNICIAN
          She's dreaming.

          FIRST TECHNICIAN
          Nightmare?

          2ND TECHNICIAN
          Off the charts. Scary monsters.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight-
          drop.
          DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for
          that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied
          with himself.

          

          

          

          

          4.
          Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And
          making him a little nervous.
          The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates
          -- no
          substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton
          longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS

          (CONTINUING)
          See, most of our best work is done
          when they're asleep. We can
          monitor and direct their
          subconscious, implant
          suggestions...
          River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector
          starts forward, slowly.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS

          (CONTINUING)
          It's a little startling to see,
          but the results are spectacular.
          Especially in this case. River
          Tam is our star pupil.
          The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
          staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we
          will very soon learn, is SIMON.

          SIMON
          I've heard that.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          She's a genius. Her mental
          capacity is extraordinary, even
          with the side-effects.

          SIMON
          Tell me about them.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Well, obviously, she's unstable...
          the neural stripping gives them
          heightened cognitive reception,
          but it also destabilizes their own
          reality matrix. It manifests as
          borderline schizophrenia... which
          at this point is the price for
          being truly psychic.

          SIMON
          (moves toward her)
          What use do we have for a psychic
          if she's insane?

          5.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I don't have to tell you the
          security potential of someone who
          can read minds. And she has lucid
          periods -- we hope to improve upon
          the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to
          ask if there's some reason for
          this inspection.

          SIMON

          (TURNING)
          Am I making you nervous?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support for the
          project was unanimous. The
          demonstration of her power --

          SIMON
          (turns back to her)
          How is she physically?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
           Like nothing we've seen. All our
          subjects are conditioned for
          combat, but River... she's a
          creature of extraordinary grace.

          400

          SIMON
          Yes. She always did love to dance.
          He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.

          ANGLE: THE BATON
          As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),
          flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting
          forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
          flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.
          Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her
          head and swabs her, whispering:

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River. Wake up. Please, it's
          Simon. River. It's your brother.
          Wake up...
          She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
          out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic
          beneath.

          6.
          River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.

          RIVER
          Simon.
          A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.

          RIVER

          (CONTINUING)
          They know you've come.

          INT. GUARD STATION - CONTINUING

          As a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret
          service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls
          into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.

          INT. RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          Simon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair
          of double doors.

          SIMON
          We can't make it to the surface
          from inside.
          Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at
          them from the other side of the doors.

          But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
          equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds
          herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and
          outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.
          The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing
          the lone orderly. Passing right under River.

          It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a
          long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
          inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.
          They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his
          baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They
          fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.
          Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small
          patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky
          blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.

          ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
          the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.
          A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops
          down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It
          comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.

          SIMON
          Get on!
          He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
          right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.
          Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as
          the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up
          in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her
          holding one of the cables --

          and River on the gurney just before it rises.

          There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
          he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.
          The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.
          He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a
          suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual
          wear. He is in:

          INT. INSTITUTE RECORDS ROOM - DAY

          -- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic
          records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
          Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.
          The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.

          Remarkable children.
          Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
          the opening) and a nervous young female intern following.
          Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Excuse me! No one is allowed in
          the records room without my
          express permission.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (over this, quietly)
          Enter the doctor.
          (to Mathias)
          Forgive me. I prefer to see the
          event alone, without bias.
          Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I need to see your clearance.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You're right to insist. I know
          you've had security issues here.
          He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
          at the readout, and drops the bluster.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Apologies. An Operative of the
          Parliament will of course have
          full cooperation.
          (looks at screen)
          I'm not sure what... I see no
          listing of rank, or name.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I have neither. Like this
          facility, I don't exist. The
          Parliament calls me in when...
          when they wish they didn't have
          to. Let's talk about the Tams.

          logs...

          River was your greatest success.
          A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until
          her brother walked in eight months
          ago and took her from you.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          It's not quite so simple.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm very aware of that.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          He came in with full creds. He
          beat the ap-scan, the retinal...
          There was no way I could --

          THE OPERATIVE
          No, no. Of course. The boy spent
          his fortune developing the
          contacts to infiltrate this place.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Gave up a brilliant future in.

          read. Turned his back on his
          whole life. Madness.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Madness, no. Something a good
          deal more dangerous. Have you
          looked at this scan carefully? At
          his face?
          Mathias looks uncertain.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          It's love, in point of fact. He
          loved his sister and he knew she
          was in pain. So he took her
          somewhere safe.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Why are you here?

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm here because the situation is
          even less simple than you think.

          It's pride.
          He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
          to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support --

          THE OPERATIVE
          (shutting it off)
          Key members of Parliament. Key.
          The minds behind every diplomatic,
          military and covert operation in
          the galaxy, and you put them in a
          room with a psychic.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          She was... she read cards, nothing
          more.

          THE OPERATIVE
          It's come to our attention that
          River became much more unstable,
          more... disturbed, after you
          showed her off to Parliament. Did
          she see something very terrible in
          those cards?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Whatever... secrets she might have
          accidentally gleaned... it's
          probable she doesn't even know she
          knows them. That they're buried
          beneath --

          THE OPERATIVE
          But they are in her. Her mind is
          unquiet. It's the will of the
          Parliament that I kill her. And
          the brother. Because of your sin.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (continuing; moving
          to his briefcase)
          You know, in certain older
          civilized cultures, when men
          failed as entirely as you have,
          they would throw themselves on
          their swords.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          (fed up)
          Well, unfortunately I forgot to
          bring a sword to --
          The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.

          THE OPERATIVE
          The Parliament has no further
          interest in psychics. They
          represent a threat to the harmony
          and stability of our Alliance.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I would put that down right now if
          I were you.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Would you be killed in your sleep,
          like an ailing pet? Whatever your
          failings, I believe you deserve
          better than that.
          The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
          with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out
          his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent
          reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm.
          The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
          quietly as the first.
          Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He
          bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine.
          Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile.
          The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace
          for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and
          holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point
          tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror
          as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it.
          The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.

          triggers. We'll have to reach out

          back to us. No matter how far out
          Simon has taken her, we can --
          He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame,
          slowed suddenly by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the
          Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him:

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          This is a good death. There's no
          shame in this, in a man's death.
          A man who's done fine works.
          We're making a better world. All
          of them, better worlds.
          Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the
          body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          Young miss, I need you to get to

          the same in Chinese behind it.

          We move away from the ship. The name is on the nose, under
          the bridge. It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
          craning neck. The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines
          on either side and a giant glowing back. There are two small
          shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines. It's not
          the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure.
          As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she
          starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears. Camera comes
          around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see
          the Captain, MALCOLM 'MAL' REYNOLDS, standing and watching.
          At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
          flying past the window.

          [Note: the following sequence will take us through the ship
          in one extended STEADICAM shot.]
          The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
          tangle of wires and machinery all about.
          Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old
          Independent. Gun at his hip. He's not unlike the ship --
          he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at
          least, weathered. Right now, though, he's mostly startled.

          He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian

          The hulking mercenary JAYNE is coming up out of his bunk as
          Mal passes. He carries a number of rifles and grenades.

          arms...

          It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There
          is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from
          a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and
          sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor.

          room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks
          and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes

          You told me --

          (JOLT)
          You told me the entry couplings
          would hold for another week!

          KAYLEE

          (WORKING)
          That was six months ago, cap'n.

          MAL
          My ship don't crash. If she
          crashes, you crashed her.

          

          

          

          

          17.
          Steam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up.
          He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned
          than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in
          dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Doctor. Guess I need to get
          innocked 'fore we hit planetside.
          Simon nods, the ship jolting again.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to
          worry about.

          SIMON
          I'm not worried.

          MAL
          Fear is nothing to be ashamed of,
          Doc.

          SIMON
          This isn't fear. This is anger.

          MAL

          4 (LAUGHS)
          Well, it's kinda hard to tell the
          one from t'other, face like yours.

          SIMON
          I imagine if it were fear, my eyes
          would be wider.

          MAL
          I'll look for that next time.

          SIMON
          You're not taking her.

          MAL
          (brushing past him)
          No no, that's not a thing I'm
          interested in talking over with --

          SIMON
          She's not going with you. That's
          final.

          4

          

          

          

          

          18.

          MAL
          (turning back)
          I hear the words "that's final"
          come out of your mouth ever again,
          they truly will be.
          (turning away again)
          This is my boat. Y'all are guests
          on it.
          He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to:

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING

          Simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs.

          SIMON
          Guests? I earn my passage,
          Captain --

          MAL
          And it's time your little sister
          learned from your fine example.

          SIMON
          I've earned my passage treating
          bullet holes, knife wounds, laser
          burns...

          MAL
          Some of our jobs are trickier than
          others --

          SIMON
          And you want to put my sister in
          the middle of that.

          MAL
          Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'.
          It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine.
          The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the
          ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of:

          INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUING

          Into which the two men step.

          SIMON
          She's a seventeen year old girl.
          A mentally traumatized sevente--

          J

          

          

          

          

          19.

          MAL
          She's a reader. Sees into the
          truth of things; might see trouble
          before it's coming. Which is of
          use to me.

          SIMON
          And that's your guiding star,
          isn't it? What's of use.

          MAL

          (LAUGHS)
          Honestly, doctor, I think we may
          really crash this time anyway.
          Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm.

          SIMON
          Do you understand what I've gone
          through to keep River away from
          the Alliance?

          MAL
          I do, and it's a fact me and mine
          have been courteous enough to keep
          to our own selves.

          SIMON
          Are you threatening to --

          MAL
          I got one purpose here: keep this
          boat in the air. I take the jobs
          I get -- which is less and less,
          case you ain't been keeping track.
          He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Every year since the war the
          Alliance pushes just a little
          further out towards the rim.
          Makes it a chore for naughty men
          like us to slip about -- and
          keeping you two on board means
          working twice as hard to avoid the
          law. Means turning down a score
          of honest jobs.

          J

          

          

          

          

          20.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          They enter the biggest space on the ship. Giant doors sit at
          the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering
          ramp. Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to
          the foredeck hall. We've come all the way through Serenity.

          MAL
          So here is us, on the raggedy
          edge. Don't push me and I won't
          push you. 
          Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him:

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Things get gritty I will keep her
          from the fray, but she's coming.
          Best you get her ready.
          As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man
          hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne and
          Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this
          boat out before we get flattened?

          ZOE
          Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody
          flies like my mister.
          The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on
          the catwalk, and track with them to find:

          SIMON
          River...
          She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose
          summer dress draped over her small frame.

          RIVER
          I know. We're going for a ride.

          EXT. LILAC -- DESERT GULCH - DAY

          Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship.
          The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to
          River in the back:

          

          

          

          

          21.

          SIMON
          Now, River, you stay behind the
          others. If there's fighting you
          drop to the floor or run away.
          It's okay to leave them to die.
          River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.

          RIVER
          I'm the brains of the operation.

          ZOE
          We should hit town right during
          Sunday worship. Won't be any
          crowds.

          MAL
          If Fanty and Mingo are right about
          the payroll, this could look to be
          a sunny day for us.

          SIMON

          (APPROACHING)
          Captain, I'll ask you one last
          time...

          MAL
          Doctor, I'm taking your sister
          under my protection here. If
          anything happens to her, anything
          at all, I swear to you I will get
          very choked up. Honestly. There
          could be tears.
          He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...

          KAYLEE
          Don't mind the Captain none,
          Simon. I know he'll look out for
          her.

          SIMON
          It's amazing. I bring River all
          the way out to the raggedy edge of
          the 'verse so she can hide from
          the Alliance by robbing banks.

          KAYLEE
          It's just a little Trading
          Station. They'll be back 'fore
          you can spit.
          (as he stalks off)
          Not that you spit...

          

          

          

          

          22.
          Kaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn.

          EXT. LILAC - DAY

          We see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in.
          The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood
          mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build
          with. Right now the streets are mainly empty.

          EXT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          The mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak:

          JAYNE
          What are we hoping to find here
          that equals the worth of a turd?

          MAL
          Alliance payroll. There's peace
          enforcing squads stationed all
          about this quadrant. Can't use
          credits out here -- they got to
          pay their boys in cashy money.
          Which once a month rests here.

          ZOE
          Something about stealing from the
          Alliance just warms a body like
          whiskey in winter.

          JAYNE
          (cocks his gun)
          Shiny. Let's be badguys.
          Mal turns back to River.

          MAL
          You ready to go to work, darlin'?

          RIVER
          There's no pattern to the pebbles
          here, they're completely random.
          I tried to count them but you
          drove too fast. Hummingbird.

          MAL
          (never mind)
          Right. Great. Let's go.

          INT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          We are in a camera's eye view, right above the door.

          J

          

          

          

          

          23.
          The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following
          and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking.
          Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with
          "Welcome to Lilac" on it for the millisecond before it's
          blown to bits.
          There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers,
          farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination
          post-office, general store, bank, and most other things.

          MAL
          Hands and knees and heads bowed
          down! Everybody, now!
          Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others.
          Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks.
          Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very
          much new in design.
          The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
          great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right
          upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! --
          bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Y'all wanna be looking very
          intently at your own belly
          buttons. I see a head start to
          rise, violence is gonna ensue.
          The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else.
          Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty
          shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform.

          JAYNE
          Looks like this is the place.
          He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front
          door. She does, and River steps in.
          ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched-
          over customers as Mal addresses them.

          MAL
          You've probably guessed we mean to
          be thieving here, but what we are
          after is not yours. So let's have
          no undue fussing.
          As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
          finding the small vault locked.

          1410

          

          

          

          

          24.

          JAYNE
          She's locked up.
          River suddenly looks around, perturbed.
          CLOSE ON: a young tough.
          River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
          young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt.
          He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.

          ZOE
          You know what the definition of a
          hero is? It's someone who gets
          other people killed. You can look
          it up later.
          He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.
          Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him
          toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow.

          TRADE AGENT
          This is just a crop moon, don't
          think you'll find what you --

          MAL
          (in Chinese)
          140 
          The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall
          safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive.
          Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.

          ZOE
          At last. We can retire and give
          up this life of crime.
          Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
          hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming
          metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal
          addresses the Trade Agent.

          MAL
          Is there a fed down there? Be
          truthful.

          TRADE AGENT

          (NODDING)
          Y'all are Browncoats, hey? Fought
          for independence?

          VJ

          

          

          

          

          25.

          MAL
          War's long done. We're all just
          folk now.
          (calls down)
          Listen up! We are coming down to
          empty that vault!
          The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.

          GUARD (O.S.)
          You have to give me your
          authorization password!
          Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into
          the hole. A beat...

           GUARD (O . S . )

           (CONTINUING)
          Okay...
          Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:

          INT. VAULT - CONTINUING

          Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets. A
          short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is
          already opening. Behind that door, a few bags of the real
          deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed.

          INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          We move in on River as something crosses her face. Worry.

          EXT. TOWN - DAY

          A WOMAN carrying a bucket and her nine year old SON are
          looking at the trading station a few buildings away.

          SON
          Repeater.

          WOMAN
          Did sound summat like gunblast...
          Maybe you aught run tell Lawman...
          She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a man.
          Mostly. He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self-
          mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning. His
          clothes are rags, his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness.
          A blade blurs through frame...

          

          

          

          

          26.

          INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          River SCREAMS and flops onto her back, pinned by revelation.
          Others look at her, concerned, as Jayne makes his way to her.

          JAYNE
          What the hell is up? You all
          right? What's goin' on?
          He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed...

          RIVER
          Reavers.

          INT. VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

          Zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the
          guard, holding his gun at him:

          MAL
          Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and
          we avoid any necessary organs...

          GUARD
          I was thinking more of a graze..

          MAL
          Well you don't want it to look
          like you just gave up...

          JAYNE (O.S.)

          MAL!

          MAL
          (to himself)
          Every heist, he's gotta start
          yelling my name --

          JAYNE
          (barreling in)
          Mal! Reavers! The girl's
          pitchin' a fit. They're here or
          they're comin' soon.
          He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly.

          MAL
          (to Zoe and Jayne)
          Get on the mule.
          (to the guard,
          pointing to the

          VAULT)
          Does that open from the inside?

          J

          

          

          

          

          27.

          GUARD
          Whah -ah- yes...

          MAL
          You get everyone upstairs in there
          and you seal it. Long as you got
          air you don't open up, you
          understand?

          GUARD
          I -- Buh I --
          Mal is in his face, dark and huge:

          MAL

          GET THEM INSIDE THE VAULT.

          EXT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          The doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal
          behind with River in hand. She is freaked, in her own space.
          Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on --

          MAL
          Zoe take the wheel --

          JAYNE
          You see 'em? Anybody see 'em?
          1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands
          River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly
          moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon
          bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule.

          YOUNG MAN
          Take me with you!

          MAL
          Get in the vault with the others --

          YOUNG MAN
          I can't stay here! Please!

          MAL
          It's too many. Drive, Zoe.
          A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size
          of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded
          conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator,
          pure. It disappears over the rooftops.

          YOUNG MAN

          PLEASE!

          

          

          

          

          28.

          MAL
          Drive!
          Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors
          it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust.
          As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows
          and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun.
          He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back.
          Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the
          chest, slumps down dead.

          ANGLE: THE EDGE OF TOWN
          As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff
          shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street,
          right abreast of our gang.

          ANGLE: THE CENTER OF TOWN
          We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
          come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines
          to swarm into it.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain.
          The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic
          fire and it swings away. There is sporadic return fire.

          JAYNE
          How come they ain't blowing us out
          of the air?

          MAL
          They wanna run us down. The up-
          close kill.
          River is squashed down on her back, being very small.

          RIVER
          They want us alive when they eat
          us.

          JAYNE
          Boy, sure would be nice if we had
          some grenades, don'tchya think?
          Mal says nothing, keeps firing.

          ZOE
          Wash, baby can you hear me?

          VO

          INT. SERENITY: BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Wash is in a frenzy of switchflipping, prepping for take-off.

          WASH
          We're moments from air. You got
          somebody behind you?
          We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point:

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING


          ZOE
          Reavers.

          WASH

          (BLANCHING)
          

          ZOE
          We're not gonna reach you in time.

          WASH
          Just keep moving, honey. We're
          coming to you.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          As she lifts off and starts heading toward the others.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          Zoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the
          air from the skiff and S} NK! Goes through Jayne's leg.. The
          harpoon grips the leg and pulls --
          Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule, Mal just grabbing
          him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter --

          MAL
          Grab on!
          Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the
          two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol.

          JAYNE
          I won't get et! You shoot me if
          they take me!
          Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne --

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Well don't shoot me first!

          J

          

          

          

          

          30.
          Mal fires. Again. Steadies himself for one more...
          The line holding the harpoon is split by Mal's third shot.

          V0V
          The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground. Mal
          hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make room.

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Rutting pigs! Where's --
          And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it.

          EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE DESERT - CONTINUING

          Serenity rushes across the desert floor, not much higher off
          it than the smaller crafts.

          WASH
          (to Zoe)
          Get some distance on 'em. You come
          to the flats, I want you to swing
          round. Gonna try a Barn Swallow.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

           Wash hits the com.

           WASH
          J Simon! Open the loading dock!

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          Simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front, hits
          a couple of buttons. The doors pull open, as the huge ramp
          beyond them opens down, letting in a rush of wind and light.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          The mule reaches the flats, away from the rocks.

          WASH (O.S.)
          (in Zoe's ear)
          Okay, baby, we've talked this
          through...

          ZOE
          Talkin' ain't doin'.
          She throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about,
          fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming skiff.

          WASH (O.S.)
          Don't slow down!

          

          

          

          

          31.

          ANGLE: THE SKIFF
          As it heads for the mule --

          ANGLE: THE MULE
          As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of
           the sky, bay doors open, and comes right up behind it -- The
          Mule swallowed by the bigger ship --

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

           And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as
           it flies backwards into the bay, narrowly missing Simon and
           smashing back into the staircase, sparks and people flying --

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          Serenity tries to get altitude -- but slams right into the
          oncoming skiff, tearing it apart --

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          A flaming portion of the top flies in, skids to the floor as
          small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a
          lever and jets of C02 shoot out of the floor.
          Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing, then
          runs to the mule. The C02 stops and he finds River sitting
          in her seat, completely unharmed. Zoe is climbing painfully
          out of the other seat, Mal and Jayne both having been thrown.

          SIMON
          River?

          RIVER
          I swallowed a bug.
          Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is. She goes to Simon.

          KAYLEE
          Are you okay?

          MAL
          Is he okay?
          A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top.
           He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth --
           Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe
           both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go
           down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op.
          4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other.

          

          

          

          

          32.

          WASH (O.S.)
          We all here? What's going on?
          Hello?
          r./ ZOE

          No casualties. Anybody following?

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING


          WASH
          Nice flying, baby, and that's a
          negative. Clean getaway -- Out of

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING


          MAL
          Set course for Beaumonde.
          (to the others)
          First thing, I want these bod --
          Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to
          stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          

          SIMON
          You stupid, selfish, son of a
          whore ---

          MAL
          I'm a hair's breadth from riddling
          you with holes, Doctor --

          SIMON
          "One simple job! She'll be fine!"

          MAL
          She IS fine! Except for bein'
          still crazy, she's the picture of
          health!

          ZOE
          Wasn't for River, we'd probably be
          left there. She felt 'em coming.

          SIMON
          Never again. You understand me?

          MAL
          Seems I remember a talk about you
          giving orders on my boat.

          SIMON
          Well sleep easy 'cause we're off
          your boat. Just as soon as River
          gets her share of the "bounty".

          KAYLEE
          Well let's not do anything hasty...

          MAL
          No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying
          tourists anyhow. We'll be on
          Beaumonde in ten hours time, you
          can pick up your earnings and be
          on your merry. Meantime you do
          your job. Patch up my crew.
          A beat.

          RIVER
          He didn't lie down. They never
          lie down.
          She is looking at the Reaver. Everyone does, for a moment.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          Mal and Zoe enter from below.

          ZOE
          No, I think things'll glide a deal
          smoother for us without River and
          Simon on board... but how long do
          you think they'll last?

          MAL
          Doc made his call. They's as
          babes in a basket when we took 'em
          in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man
          has to cut loose, learn to stand
          on his own.

          ZOE
          Like that man back in town?
          They stop by Mal Is room.

          MAL
          I had to shoot him. What the
          Reavers woulda done to him before
          they killed him...

          ZOE
          I know. That was a piece a'
          mercy. But before that, him
          begging us to bring him along...
          vo,

          MAL
          We couldn't take the weight.
          Woulda slowed us down.

          ZOE
          You know that for certain

          MAL
          Mule won't run with five. I
          shoulda dumped the girl? Or you?
          Or Jayne?

          (CONSIDERING)
          Well, Jayne...

          ZOE
          Coulda tossed the payload.

          MAL
          And go to Fanty and Mingo with air
          in our mitts, tell 'em "here's
          your share"? They'd set the dogs
          on us in the space of a twitch,
          and there we are back in mortal
          peril. We get a job, we gotta
          vo make good.
          Washenters from the bridge.

          ZOE
          Sir, I don't disagree on any
          particular point, it's just... in
          the time of war, we woulda never
          left a man stranded.

          MAL
          Maybe that's why we lost.
          She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room
          as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her.

          INT. MAL'S ROOM - CONTINUING

          Once alone, Mal lets his own disappointment show. He pulls
          off his holster and drops it over a chair. Kicks the toilet
          closed and sits on his bunk.
          The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and
          clutter, ancient maps on the walls.

          Mal moves a bunch of papers off his bunk and a picture slides
          out. Hits the floor and starts moving: it's a snapshot-movie

          INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE

          We're close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused
          exasperation. Behind her is an opulently dressed little
          shuttle.

          INARA
          Kaylee, are you ever gonna put
          that capture down?

          KAYLEE (0.5.)
          We gotta have records of
          everything. A bona fide Companion
          entertained clients on this very
          ship! In this very bed!
          The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending
          over and sniffing curiously. Inara is packing things up.

          KAYLEE (O.S.)

          (CONTINUING)
          For one sweet second, we was
          almost classy.

          INARA
          4 You promised to help me pack.

           KAYLEE (O.S.)
          Honest, Inara, why do you have to
          leave?
          Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the
          picture freezes, goes back to the beginning.
          During all this, Mal has picked it up. He looks at it a
          moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much.

          JAYNE (V.0.)
          I do not get it. How's a guy get
          so wrong?

          INT. CARGO BAY - LATER

          We see the doors in the floor slide open, a second set below.
          Pan to see, for a moment, the dead Reaver's face.
          Kaylee is opening the doors with a keypad on a cable. Jayne
          drags the corpse closer to the doors as he continues:

          R

          

          

          

          

          36.

          JAYNE
          Ain't logical. Cuttin' on his own
          face, rapin' and murdering -- I
          mean, I'll kill a man in a fair
          fight... or if I think he's gonna
          start a fair fight, or if he
          bothers me, or if there's a woman,
          or I'm gettin' paid -- mostly only
          when I'm gettin' paid. But these
          Reavers... last ten years they
          just show up like the boageyman
          from stories. Eating people
          alive? Where does that get fun?
          He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing.

          KAYLEE
          Shepherd Book said they was men
          that reached the edge of space.,
          saw a vasty nothingness and just
          went bibbledy over it.

          JAYNE
          Hell, I been to the edge. Just
          looked like more space.

          KAYLEE
          I don't know. People get awful
          lonely in the black. Like to get
          addlepated ourselves, we stay on
          this boat much longer. Captain'll
          drive us all off, one by one.

          JAYNE
          You're just in a whinge cuz that
          prissy doc is finally
          disembarking. Me I says good
          riddance. He never belonged here,
          and his sister's no saner than one
          of them Reavers.

          KAYLEE
          That ain't even so! River's a
          dear heart and a boon to this
          crew! You just don't like her
          'cause she can read your mind and
          everything you think is mean.

          JAYNE
          Well, there is that.

          Her and Simon could have a place
          here. Now they're leaving us.
          Just like Shepherd Book.
          She looks up toward one of the shuttles.

          KAYLEE

          (CONTINUING)
          Just like Inara...

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

          And here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes
          half closed in passion. She settles on a cluster of brocaded
          pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss...
          Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and
          that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in
          saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved
          heads in the back, also on their knees.
          Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She
          speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
          repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her
          the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
          They love you.

          EXT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DUSK

          Inara looks out at the mountains. The space she's in
          resembles a Tibetan monastery, if slightly more opulent.
          Widen to see she is with SHEYDRA, a somewhat older Companion,
          the woman whose voice we heard. She hands Inara a drink.

          SHEYDRA
          The girls. They've learned more
          from you these last months than
          the rest of us could show them in
          two years.

          INARA
          They're very sweet. But they're
          not Companions.

          SHEYDRA

          (WRYLY)
          You've no hope for them? Junk the
          lot, start anew?

          J

          

          

          

          

          38.

          INARA
          On Sihnon we started training at
          twelve. Years of discipline and
          preparation before the physical
          act of pleasure was even
          mentioned. Most of these girls --

          SHEYDRA
          They're all of good family, the
          highest academic standards --

          INARA
          Control. Was the first lesson.
          And the last and these worlds are
          not like the Central Planets.
          There is barbarism dressed up in
          the most civil weeds. Men of the
          highest rank who don't know the
          difference between a Companion and
          a common whore. It's unsafe.

          SHEYDRA
          All the more reason the girls look
          to you. You came out here alone,
          before the Alliance ever thought
          to establish a House this remote.
          You've seen so much. You're a
          figure of great romance to them.
          4d INARA
          Great romance has nothing to do
          with being a Companion, Sheydra.
          You should know better.

          SHEYDRA
          I'm not the one who had a torrid
          affair with a pirate.
          Inara nearly spills her drink.

          INARA
          A who? With a what?

          SHEYDRA

          (SMILING)
          It's the talk of the House. The
          girls all trade stories in the
          dorms at night.

          INARA
          I didn't... have a pirate...

          J

          

          

          

          

          39.

          SHEYDRA
          In one of the stories you make
          love in a burning temple. I think
          that's my favorite.

          INARA

          (SITTING)
          This is unbearable. Captain
          Reynolds is no pirate; he's a
          petty thief. And he never laid a
          finger on me. All he ever did was
          rent me a shuttle and be very
          annoying.
          (mutters in Chinese)
          

          SHEYDRA
          A year on his shuttle and he never
          laid a finger on you. No wonder
          you left.

          INARA

          (BRIDLING)
          I left because -- go away. We're
          no longer friends. You're a
          stranger to me now.

          SHEYDRA
          104 I do love to watch you boil.
          Don't worry. The stories will
          fade. And your Captain Reynolds
          has probably gotten himself blown
          up by this time.

          INARA
          (looking away again)
          Yes. That would be just like him.

          EXT. BEAUMONDE: ATOLL PLAZA - EVENING

          Serenity touches down on the crowded atoll amidst a number of
          other, equally disreputable ships. The place is filled with
          every kind of immigrant culture and shop imaginable.

          EXT./INT. SERENITY - EVENING

           The ramp is open and everyone is filing out, ready to hit the
           town. Kaylee is talking to Simon, who has River in hand.

           KAYLEE
           Don't talk to the barkers -- only
           the captains.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          40.
           KAYLEE (cont'd)
           You look the captain in the eye,
           know who you're dealing with.

          40 SIMON
          â¢ I wish there was...
          Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on:

          KAYLEE
          You shouldn't aughta be so clean.
          It's a dead giveaway you don't
          belong, you always gotta be tidy.
          Don't pay anybody in advance. And
          don't ride in anything with a
          Capissen 38 engine, they fall
          right out of the sky.

          SIMON
          Kaylee.
          She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other
          direction, but River looks after her and the others.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River... do you want to stay with
          them?

          4 RIVER
          It's not safe.

          SIMON
          No, I fear it's not safe anymore.
          He's heading off and doesn't hear:

          RIVER
          For them.

          INT. THE MAIDENHEAD - CONTINUING

          We start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report. On the
          screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed, now half of it
          a smoking ruin.

          NEWSPERSON (V.O.)
          that it was a band of Reavers
          remains unconfirmed. The only
          survivors of the massacre
          apparently locked themselves in
          the Trade Station vault until --

          40

          

          

          

          

          41.
          During this we come around to see that the screen has a
          blinking light behind it, come THROUGH the wiring of the back
          to look out at the bar, with the word "recording" in the
          corner. Every screen is a camera, even down here.

          40
          We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting
          away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories
          straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and
          booths and a second screen playing in the corner.

          MAL
          It's not my fault the Doc's got no
          stomach for Rim living --

          KAYLEE
          It is entirely and for all your
          fault! If you'd given Simon a
          moment, just a moment where he
          didn't think you were gonna throw
          them off or turn them in, he
          might've --

          MAL
          What? Swept you into his cleanly
          arms? Made tidy love to you?
          They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have
          already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat:
          Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the
          q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A
          large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.

          KAYLEE
          (as they continue

          DOWN)
          Don't you dare joke! You know how
          much I pined on Simon. And him
          fair sweet on me, I well believe,
          but he's so worried about being
          found out --

          ZOE
          Captain didn't make 'em fugitives.

          KAYLEE
          But he coulda made 'em family!
          Steada driving them off. Steada
          keeping Simon from seein' I was
          there, when I carried such a torch
          and we coulda -- goin' on a year
          now I ain't had nothin' twixt my
          nethers weren't run on batteries!

          40

          

          

          

          

          42.

          MAL
          Oh god! I can't know that!

          JAYNE
          40 I could stand to hear a little
          more...

          KAYLEE
          If you had a care for anybody's
          heart you woulda --

          MAL

          (ENOUGH)
          You knew he was gonna leave. We
          never been but a way station to
          those two. And how do you know
          what he feels? He's got River to
          worry on but he still coulda shown
          you... if I truly wanted someone
          bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in
          the 'verse could stop me from
          going to her.

          KAYLEE
          Tell that to Inara.
          For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react. Kaylee storms out.

          MINGO
          4 Domestic troubles?
          MINGO is young, tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a
          fur-trader. Sounds lower-class British, or something like it.

          FANTY
          Domestic troubles?
          FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is
          Mingo's identical twin. Apart from slight differences in
          dress, they are indistinguishable.

          MINGO
          'Cause we don't wanna interrupt.

          FANTY
          A man should keep his house in
          order.

          MAL
          (greets them each)
          Mingo. Fanty.

          14

          

          

          

          

          43.

          MINGO
          (pointing at his

          BROTHER)
          He's Mingo.
          ,do

          MAL
          He's Fanty. You're Mingo.

          MINGO
          Ghahh! How is it you always know?

          MAL
          Fanty's prettier.
          (pulling out a chair)
          Feel to do some business?

          MINGO
          (re: Mal Is gang)
          Bit crowded, isn't it? As you
          see, we come unencumbered by thugs.

          MAL
          Which means at least four of the
          guys already in here are yours.
          All's one. I'll just keep Jayne
          with me.

          ZOE
           Sir, are you sure you don't --

          4

          MAL
          Go. Go get yourselves a nice
          romantic meal.

          WASH
          Those are my two favorite words!
          (to Zoe)
          Honey... "Meal..."

          MAL
          (to Zoe)
          It's business. We're fine.
          They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a
          few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance...
          ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently
          blocked by her little dance.
          Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.

          MINGO
          Quite a crew you've got.

          4

          

          

          

          

          44.

          MAL
          Yeah, they're a fine bunch of
          ruebens.

          MINGO
          How you keep them on that crap
          boat is the subject of much musing
          tween me and Fanty.

          FANTY
          We go on and on.

          MAL
          So I'm noticing. Is there a
          problem I don't know of? You got
          25% of a sweet take kissing your
          foot, how come we're not
          dispersing?

          FANTY
          Our end is forty, precious.

          JAYNE
          My muscular buttocks it's forty --

          MINGO
          It is as of now. Find anyone
          around going cheaper.

          J FANTY
          Find anyone around going near a
          sorry lot like you in the first
          instance.
          ANGLE: RIVER has entered, is looking about.
          Jayne sees her, nudges Mal, who looks and turns back to
          business. We stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter
          of the bar, vaguely listening in on Mal's deal.

          FANTY

          (CONTINUING)
          You're unlikable, Mal. You got no
          respect for us above you, you got
          enemies in every quadrant, and
          your ship's older than the
          starting point of time. You's
          charity cases to such as us.

          

          

          

          

          45.

          MAL
          Well here's a foul thought. I
          conjured you two were incompetent;
          sent us out not knowing there were
          V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking
          you picked us out because you did.

          MINGO
          That were a sign of faith, boy.
          And it doesn't affect our forty
          per. Danger is, after all, your
          business.

          JAYNE
          Reavers ain't business, double
          dickless.
          This is all background noise to River, who has moved to the
          CV screen, on which is a commercial. It's animated, goofy,
          cartoon animals and anime-style Asian girls all transforming
          to insane fantasy figures as they sing about:

          COMMERCIAL

          FRUITY OATY BARS, POW! HEY! FRUITY

          BARS, MAKE A MAN OF A MOUSE, MAKE

          YOU BUST OUT YOUR BLOUSE, EAT THEM

          NOW, BANG! PING! ZOW! -- TRY

          FRUITY, OATY BARS.
          We push in, the light from the CV on River's face, pushing to
          EXTREME CLOSE UP, all noise but the jingle fading out,
          finally that as well, just the hum in River's ears.
          And she whispers:

          RIVER
          Miranda.
          She turns and looks back at the crowd.
          What happens next happens very fast.
           She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
          quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips
           it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as --
           people are turning, just registering that this girl --
          kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a
          bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her
          square in the face, a man she never even looked at -- people
          are rising, fleeing or pushing forward --

          V0

          

          

          

          

          46.

          MAL
          River...

          JAYNE
          V0 Whuhuh?
          She's taking out a group of four, high kicks and perfect
          precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out
          a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above
          her head, using his momentum to stab the other one --
          Mal fights to get back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches
          her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on
          Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
          the rod at her head, knocks her cold...
          She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using
          the room itself to take out every single person there. One
          man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg
          around the corner and nails his face.
          Jayne grabs her from behind --

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Gorrammit, girl, it's me!
          She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she
          spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm,
          V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching
           of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table --
          Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to
          scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --
          Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
          knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and
          then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with
          his, they are pointed right at each other --

          SIMON
          Eta Kooram Nah Smech!
          And River drops to the ground, fast asleep.
          There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon,
          who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing.
          He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.

          MAL
          I think maybe we ought to leave.

          10

          

          

          

          

          47.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           We see two sleek warships glide silently into frame, followed
           by a third, bigger ship. This is the operative's vessel, and
          10 it is everything Serenity is not: sleek, predatory, icy cool.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          The operative is looking at the Maidenhead security feed --
          and River is staring right at him.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CAPTIVATED)
          Hello again. Yes, it's me. I'm
          glad you've finally asked for me.
          An Ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor:

          ENSIGN
          We got a pos on a retinal -- man
          carrying her out is Malcolm

          The ship. The name of the ship.

          seven weeks, two of them after
          their high command had
          surrendered. 68% casualty rate.

          River is still asleep, Mal finishing chaining her wrists.
          She lies on her side, breathing evenly.
          Mal stares at her a moment, then:

          He exits to find the whole group waiting for him, sans Wash.

          MAL
          She's still napping just now. And

          ZOE
          Do we know if anyone was killed?

          It's likely. I know she meant to

          You feel to elaborate on what that

          Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him.

          SIMON
          I thought she was getting better.

          JAYNE
          And I thought they was gettin' off!

          Mal looks at Jayne, at all of them. Doesn't have an answer.

          May I see her.
          Mal steps aside. Simon enters the locker.

          JAYNE

          have to put a bullet to her.

          The camera swoops in at a sparking ion cloud, then through
          the cloud at a barren, metallic satellite moon. Then further
          in to reveal a sprawling -- and completely empty --
          communications complex. Giant satellite dishes everywhere.

          Inside, we find an unkempt young man. Also sleep-deprived,
          over-caffeinated and kinda sweet. This is MR UNIVERSE. He
          is alone but for his mannikin-like Love-bot, Lenore.
          He's surrounded by screens, computers, feeds -- machinery
          that looks both ultra-modern and long neglected. All the
          screens play different images -- it's a mediaverse.

          As he watches the security feed of River's fight his image
          becomes a vidscreen. He's addressing Wash, Mal and Zoe.

          BOOK
          It's for the men River might have
          killed in that bar.

          MAL
          Weren't River that did it, you
          know that. Somebody decided her
          brain was just another piece of
          property to take, fenced it right
          Vd up.

          This isn't a palms-up military
          MW run, Mal. No reports broadwaved,
          no warrants... much as they want
          her, they want her hid. That
          means Closed File. Means an

          not known.

           As he continues, we see an image of him watching over the
           sleeping girl, his mind, racing.

           I had an out -- hell, I had every
          reason in the 'verse to leave her

          They'll come at you sideways.

          Inara stands waiting, her back to us, in front of the very
          vista we first saw her before.
          The operative comes slowly up the staircase, stands before
          her.

          The Teacher from the very beginning is standing in front of
          River, whose desktop screen depicts a single, dark planet.

          TEACHER
          River?
          Eight-year-old River is working away, not paying attention.

          TEACHER

          River, you look tired. I think
          everybody's a little tired by now;
          why don't we all lie down.
          River looks up, scared. All the other children wordlessly
          get up from their seats and lie on the floor next to them.

          A little peace and quiet will make
          everything better.

          No...
          Vao TEACHER
          River. Do as you're told. It's
          going to be fine. Lie down.

          Oh. Thank you, I... I guess we
          have something of a problem here.
          With the locals, I thought maybe...

          MAL
          You could use a gun hand?

          INARA
          I'm hoping not. But if you were
          close at all, you -- the crew --
          could take your ease here a
          while... and there'd be payment...

          MAL
          Payment is never not a factor. I
          could sound out the crew... This
          pot like to boil over soon?

          INARA
          Soon. Not right away.

          MAL
          Well, it would be, I mean I would
          like to... Kaylee's been missing
           you something fierce --

          There is a general groan among the audience, which now

          Yeah, you left a... got some of
          your stuff in a trunk, never did
          get a chance to drop it off.

          INARA
          Oh.

          I didn't look through the...

          it's a trap?

          MAL
          If that's the case, then Inara's
          already caught in it. She
          wouldn't set us up willing. Might
          be we got a shot at seeing who's

          How can you be sure Inara don't

          She is kneeling in front of a statue of Buddha, lighting a
          few incense sticks.
          The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle
          where she entertained men, but still beautifully furnished
          and draped. A lace curtain hangs in front of the light,
          casting its pattern in shadow over everything. Including the
          rather large figure in a red shawl who kneels beside Inara.

          Well that makes you kind of a

          What are you doing?

          INARA
          I'm praying for you, Mal.

          The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he
          moves, Mal counters.

          You really don't.

          Fair to say. But I have to hope
          you understand you can't beat us.

          MAL
          I got no need to beat you. I just
          wanna go my way.

          THE OPERATIVE
          And you can do that, once you let
          me take the girl back home. Give
          me the opportunity to help you.

          MAL
          All I gotta do is let you take one
          more thing away from me. I've had
          a lot of things taken in my time.
          And it may just be that this is
          one too many.

          This psychotic, potentially
          murderous girl who can't have the
          slightest awareness of your
          protection. This is where you
          "draw the line".

          Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all
          around it, and tosses it to the Operative.

          MAL
          You do that, best make peace with
          your dear and fluffy lord.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Pulse beacon.

          MAL
          Advice from an old tracker: you
          J wanna find someone, use your eyes.

          THE OPERATIVE
          How long do you think you can
          really run from us?

          MAL
          Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I
          never credited the Alliance with
          an over-abundance of brains. And
          if you're the best they got...

          THE OPERATIVE
          Captain Reynolds, I should tell
          you so that you don't waste your
          time: You can't make me angry.

          INARA
          Oh please. Spend an hour with him.
          Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey!"

          

          

          

          

          70.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I need her, Captain. River is...
          my purpose and I will gather her
          to me. The brother as well.
          Whatever else happens is
          incidental. In the greater scheme.

          MAL
          Why is it that the greater scheme
          always makes everything not that
          great?

          THE OPERATIVE
          I want to resolve this like
          civilized men. I'm not
          threatening you. I'm unarmed.

          MAL
          Great!
          He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
          Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway.
          The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I am of course wearing full body
          armor. I'm not a moron.
          He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
          blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts,
          but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds.
          Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative
          kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets
          to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose
          dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.

          MAL
          No back up? We're making an awful
          ruckus...

          THE OPERATIVE
          They'll come when they're needed.

          MAL
          I'd start whistling.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Captain, what do you think is
          going to happen here?
          They come at each other. The Operative is the much better
          trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.

          40

          

          

          

          

          71.
          Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's
          precision is wearing Mal down.
          Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
          V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara,
          breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara
          places her hand on his arm.
          The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out
          his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of
          fascination as he looks at it.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          Nothing here is what it seems.

          INARA
          I know.

          THE OPERATIVE
          He's not the plucky hero. The
          Alliance isn't some evil empire.
          This isn't the grand arena.

          INARA
          And that's not incense.
          He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like
          a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound.

          40
          It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything
          goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz.
          The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
          soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and
          Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - CONTINUING

          Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps
          and along a corridor. The sound is still tinny and weird.

          MAL
          .I had him...

          INARA
          What?

          MAL
          (deafly loud)
          I think that I was winning!

          4

          

          

          

          

          72.

          EXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, BY MAL'S SHUTTLE - DAY

          Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to
          see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by
          V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking
          grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at
          the foursome.
          CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
          one by one, counting down --

          ALLIANCE SOLDIER
          Grenade!
          Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara
          race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as
          the last light goes out and nothing happens.
          One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the
          door shuts on him and Inara.

          INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING

          Inara pushes into the pilot's seat.

          INARA
          Hang on to something.

          MAL
          4 You sure you remember how it --
          He nearly falls over as:

          EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUING

          The shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out.

          INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING

          Inara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the
          controls. Mal is gone.

          INARA
          I told you to hang on.

          MAL (O.S. )
          (in great pain)
          I'm fine...

          EXT. SPACE - LATER

          We are below Serenity as her bay doors are closing, six
          little objects floating out of her belly like roe.

          4

          

          

          

          

          73.
          These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly
          home-made, parts welded together almost haphazardly. They
          all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different
          directions, as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect
          and burns away from us.

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

          The Operative sips tea and rubs his temple.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (into a com)
          Forget the pulse beacon, there has
          to be another way to track the
          ship -- get a read on the nav sat.
           It's a registered transport, you
           must be able to locate --

           ENSIGN (O.S.)
          Sir?

          THE OPERATIVE
          Have you found a nav sat
          trajectory?

          ENSIGN (O.S.)
          Sir... we've found seven.
          The Operative looks more unhappy than angry.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (to himself)
          Does he think this is a game?

          EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in
          the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle-
          holes in her head -- makes her way through them.
          Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen. On it is
          the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and
          planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes
          in to one system, one planet...
          She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see:

          INT. LAB - CONTINUING

          Her POV is of the lab. There stand some five older men in
          formal dress. They stare at her, impassive.
          We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city
          streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face --

          .00

          

          

          

          

          74.

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER - DAY

          And River awakens. A moment to get her bearings, then her
          eyes narrow with intent.

          INARA (V.0.)
          We have every reason to be afraid.

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING


          JAYNE
          Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal?
          That ain't so hard --

          MAL
          He didn't beat me up --

          INARA
          Because he's a believer.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP, A DARK CABIN

          As Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs.
          Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters.

          INARA (V.0.)
          He's intelligent, methodical and
          devout in his belief that killing
          River is the right thing to do.

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING


          INARA
          I honestly think the only reason
          we haven't been blown out of the
          air is that he needs to see her.

          SIMON
          Needs to see her why?

          INARA
          I'm uncertain. I would say to be
          sure of the kill, but... I just
          know he'll kill us all to get to
          her.

          JAYNE
          So no hope of a reward, huh?

          ZOE
          Did he mention a deal of any kind?

          IWO

          

          

          

          

          75.

          MAL
          (looking at Simon)
          Give the two of them up. Go my
          way.

          JAYNE
          Which you was all ready to do not
          a day ago. What went sour?

          MAL
          Cutting them loose ain't the same
          as handing them over.

          JAYNE
          That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm
          about to become is having trouble
          telling the difference.

          SIMON
          (to Inara)
          Did he say anything about a
          "Miranda"?

          INARA
          What is that?

          MAL
          Don't know who or what, but it's
          on River's mind. Conjure it might
          be the reason he's after her.

          INARA
          You think maybe it poses some kind
          of threat to the Alliance?

          WASH
          Do we care? Are we caring about
          that?

          JAYNE
          You dumbass hogs, the only people
          she's a threat to is us on this
          boat!

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER - CONTINUING

          River is near the ceiling, keeping herself up in a split
          again, feet against the walls. There is a wire mesh cover to
          the light, and she has bent part of it out, is working it
          inside the lock of her shackles.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - MOMENTS LATER


          MAL
          Look, we get back to Haven in a
          'r/ few hours time --

          JAYNE
          Hiding under the Shepherd's
          skirts, that's a manful scheme --

          MAL
          You wanna run this ship?

          JAYNE
          Yes!

          MAL
          (small beat)
          Well you can't!

          JAYNE
          Do a damn sight better job'n you.
          Getting us lashed over a couple of
          strays...
          (to Simon)
          No offense, Doc, I think it's
          noble as a grape the way you look
          to River, but she ain't my sister
          (to Mal)
          and she ain't your crew. Oh, and
          neither is she exactly helpless!
          So where's it writ we gotta lay
          down our lives for her, which is
          what you've steered us toward.

          MAL
          I didn't start this.

          JAYNE
          No, the Alliance starts the war --
          and then you volunteer. Battle of
          Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here,
          how many --
          (Mal turns away)
          -- I'm talkin' at you -- how many
          men in your platoon came out of
          there alive?
          Mal stares at him.

          ZOE
          (dead cold)
          You wanna leave this room.

          

          

          

          

          77

          JAYNE
          You're damn right I do.
          He stalks upstairs. There's a quiet moment.

          INARA
          This isn't the war, Mal.
          Mal turns, eyeing her.

          MAL
          Are you telling me that because
          you think I don't know --

          INARA
          You came to the training house
          looking for a fight.

          MAL
          I came looking for you.

          INARA
          I just want to know who I'm
          dealing with. I've seen too many
          versions of you to be sure.

          MAL
          I start fighting a war I guarantee
          you'll see something new.

          TO
          Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over:

          SIMON
          We'll get off. River and I'll get
          off at Haven and find some --

          KAYLEE
          Nobody's saying that.

          WASH
          Nobody besides Jayne is saying
          that.

          MAL

          (TURNING)
          I got no answers for you, Inara.
          I got no rudder. Wind blows
          40 northerly, I go north. That's who
          I am. Maybe that ain't a man to
          lead but they have to follow so
          you wanna tear me down do it
          inside your own mind.

          0

          INARA
          I'm not trying to tear you down --

          MAL
          But you fog things up. You always
          have -- you spin me about. I wish
          like hell you was elsewhere.

          INARA
          I was.

          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING

          Jayne is looking at the storage locker door. A beat.

          JAYNE
          
          He moves to the aft hall, shuts and locks the door. Goes
          40 back to the locker and starts to unlock it, pulling his gun.

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          No trouble now, little crazy
          person... we're going for a nice

          I
          shuttle ride --
          He opens the door and she is on him in an instant, whip blow
          to the throat, the nose -- he fires wildly as she jumps on
          him, wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back --

          INT. AFT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          The crew enters, drawn by the shots. Mal is first -- can't
          open the door. Looks in to see an unconscious Jayne...

          MAL
          The other way! Find her and-do
          not engage!
          Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in
          the window.

          ANGLE: SIMON'S POV: There is Jayne, not moving -- and River
          pops up right in front of us.
          He starts, then waits as she opens the door.

          NO

          SIMON
          It's gonna be oka --
          She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees,
          shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground. He
          doesn't move. She looks at him a moment, then takes off.

          INT. CARGO BAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Mal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the
          upstairs. He gives up, looking around.

          ZOE
          She's sealed off the bridge. I do
          not like her there.

          KAYLEE
          Cap'n!
          She tosses him a bolt remover. He starts pulling a bolt out
          of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe:

          MAL
          Check the shuttles. She coulda
          40 snuck in.
          He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL/BRIDGE - LATER

          A floor panel hinges open, Mal pulling himself up. He moves
          quietly to the bridge, gun drawn.
          He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates
          on a big Cortex screen she's pulled out by the copilot's
          seat. She whips Jayne's gun at his face, never looking at
          him. A moment, and Mal lowers his own gun.

          MAL
          The government's man, he says

          Everyone has gathered. Wash is piloting now, as they are in
          atmosphere. River is by Simon. She moves restlessly, upset.

          KAYLEE
          How can it be there's a whole
          planet called Miranda and none of
          us knowed that?

          MAL
          Because there isn't one. It's a
          blackrock. Uninhabitable.
          Terraforming didn't hold, or
          somesuch. Few settlers died.

          RIVER

          I had to show them. I didn't know
          if you were going to make me sleep.

          Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years
          back, before the war. There was
          call for workers to settle on
          Miranda, my daddy talked about
          going. I should've recalled...

          WASH
          But there's nothing about it on
          the Cortex -- History,
          Astronomy... it's not in there.

          MAL
          Half of writing history is hiding
          the truth. There's something on
          this rock the Alliance doesn't
          want known.

          Alliance ship not far from the cannon that shot it down.

          She stops, looking at the ground by the steeple. There is
          the body on the ground, face down. The child she played with
          at dinner. Kaylee stares, at first uncomprehending.
          ANGLE: MAL, moving in the other direction, approaches the
          cannon, Jayne behind him. He stops and sees:
          Book, lying by the cannon, torn up badly from the waist down.

          Mal stands alone amidst the screens, saying nothing. After
          a long moment, all of the screens hitch, the images replaced
          by identical images of the Operative. He looks solemn.

          THE OPERATIVE
          V0 I'm sorry. But I cannot let you
          hide and I cannot let you run.
          Things become... extreme. And we

          MAL
          Don't talk at me like a righteous

          When God wanted Pharaoh to release
          His people from bondage -- you

          He sent his plagues down upon
          Egypt. That's me, Captain. The

          place for me there, any more than
          40 there is for you. Malcolm, I'm a
          monster. What I do is evil, I've
          no illusions about it. But it
          must be done.

          MAL
          Why? Do you know why?

          THE OPERATIVE
          It's not my place to ask.

          MAL
          You will never see River Tam. I'm
          telling you this.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Maybe not. But you'll keep her
          close now, and when I blow
          Serenity out of the air, this will
          be ended. You're so terribly out
          of your depth, Captain. Your old
          boat can't take the pressure.

          MAL
          She ain't buckled yet. And the
          40 only reason you're talking such a
          lot is you can't get a fix on us.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Yes, your scrambler's code is too
          old for our seekers. You love
          that, yes? The small triumph over
          modernity. You really are the
          noble savage.

          MAL
          Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble.

          THE OPERATIVE
          But that's what's going to kill
          you, Malcolm. Nobility. It
          confuses your text, which is
          self-interest. And sin.

          Serenity flies, silent.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL/BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The group make their way toward the bridge. Those close
          enough to get a view out the window are looking freaked --
          those already on the bridge are stock still. Pressed up
          against the glass of the window is River, just staring.

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Reverse to see: an armada.
          The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a
          vague cluster, as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them.
          Most of them hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly
          about. Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around.
          Vd INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
          They all wait, tensed up, as they approach the armada...

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          And arrive, moving slowly through the ranks of ships.
          Serenity passes a large, bizarrely shaped ship. It turns, as
          though watching her. But lets her pass.
          Another minute, and Serenity is through the Armada, headed
          for the small planet just beyond.

          INT. SERENITY: BRIDGE - LATER

          Kaylee, Simon and River have left the bridge. The clouds fog
          the windows, so nothing below is visible.

          ZOE
          Every reading I'm getting says
          normal. Oceans, land masses... no
          tectonic instability or radiation.

          Yeah, but no power, either.

          MAL
          Nothing at all?

          WASH
          Wait. Something. Might be a
          beacon, but it's awful weak.

          MAL
          Find it.

          EXT. SERENITY - DAY

          As she touches down, filling the frame. After a moment Mal,
          Zoe and Jayne emerge from the airlock in full suits, armed.
          Zoe reads a handheld scanner...

          WIDER ANGLE: They're in a CITY. Gleaming metal, spread out
          for miles in every direction. Portions decimated by fires

          EXT. CITY - DAY

          Out of their suits now, Mal, Zoe and Jayne take point as the
          entire crew walks along the street, looking about them.

          ZOE
          Ho.
          She moves rapidly, gun out, to:

          ANGLE: A SKELETON
          Face-down on the ground, clothes tattered. She examines it
          as Mal approaches, waving the others back.

          ANGLE: JAYNE is by a downed hovercraft. Inside are three
          skeletons: two grown-ups and a small child. Clothes in
          better condition, and again no sign of violence.

          JAYNE
          They's all just sittin'. Didn't

          ANGLE: RIVER is quietly becoming more and more upset.
          CLOSE ON: KAYLEE walks in front of an office building,
          staying away from the cars as she hears:

          But she looks --

          KAYLEE
          GAAAAaaoh God --
          -- and steps back, horrified, as the others approach.
          It's an office. About half the employees are there, in
          chairs or on the ground, all in the same state as the first
          fellow. We see ANGLES of the corpses as the gang evaluates...

          JAYNE
          How come they're preserved?

          MAL
          Place must've gone hermetic when
          the power blew. Sealed 'em.

          KAYLEE

          What're they doing? What's
          everybody doing?

          SIMON
          There's no discoloration, nobody's
          doubled over or showing signs of
          pain...

          MAL
          There's gasses that kill painless,

          INARA
          But they didn't fall down. None
          of them. They just lay down.

          SIMON
          More than anything, it looks like
          starvation.

          MAL
          Anybody want to bet there's plenty
          of food around?

          INARA
          They just lay down...
          They notice River now, in the middle of the street, keening.
          She drops to her knees, clutching her head.

          WASH
          Let's get to the beacon.

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - DAY

          It's small -- landing is easier in cities with flying
          vehicles. At the end of a short runway, tipped and damaged,
          is an Alliance Research Vessel. The gang makes its way
          towards it.

          INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - DAY

          It's a mess, doors pried open, signs of violence but no
          bodies. The gang walks through it, looking around.
          River pulls away from Simon, suddenly determined. She
          approaches a console, and a small cylindrical object. She
          turns it slightly --
          A hologram squawks to life amidst them all. First we see
          images that resemble the flashes from River's mind: Corpses,
          everywhere. We hear and then see DOCTOR CARON standing
          exactly where she was when she recorded this message...
          (As she speaks, we see angles of everyone watching, taking it
          in.. River silently mouths every word.)

          -- just a few of the images we've
          recorded, and you can see it
          isn't.. it isn't what we thought.
          There's been no war here, and no
          terraforming event. The
          environment is stable. It's the
          Pax, the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate
          that we added to the air
          processors. It's...
          (tearing up)
          .well it works... it was
          supposed to calm the population,
          weed out aggression. Make a
          peaceful... it worked. The people
          here stopped fighting. And then
          they stopped everything else.
          They stopped going to work,
          stopped breeding... talking...
          eating...
          (trying for control)
          There's thirty million people here
          and they all just let themselves
          die. They didn't even kill
          themselves. They just... most
          starved. When they stopped
          working the power grids, there
          were overloads, fires -- people
          burned to death sitting in their
          V0 chairs. Just sitting.
          There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts,
          gathers herself.

          CARON

          (CONTINUING)
          I have to be quick. There was no
          one working the receptors when we
          landed, so we hit pretty hard. We
          can't leave. We can't take any of
          the local transports because...
          The bang again.

          CARON

          (CONTINUING)
          There are people... they're not
          people... about a tenth of a
          percent of the population had the
          opposite reaction to the Pax.
          Their aggressor response
          increased... beyond madness.

          She whirls, grabs a gun and fires -- then aims the gun at her
           own head - but a Reaver is on her, knocks the gun away and
          bites her face --
          She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her, biting at
          her and tearing at her clothes, at her skin.

          appears behind him, follows -- he holds a hand out behind
          him, seemingly to make her stop, but then he grabs her
          shoulder, holds her for support. She puts her hand over his.

          He looks at her, folds her into his arms. Brings her face to
          his, not kissing but touching, pressing into each other with
          the urgency of pulsing, necessary life.

          It BLOWS, fragmenting into burning bits that spiral into
          other ships, causing two smaller ones to blow as well.
          Mal swings around and fires at another ship.

          EXT. SATELLITE - NIGHT

          In close orbit waits the Alliance force, at least fifty
          strong, and clearly with high tech firepower. We move in on
          the Operative's ship, in the middle of the cluster.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          As the Operative waits with the others.

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          It's the Operative's POV: the swirling Ion cloud as Serenity
          breaks through and heads at us, fully Reavered out.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          He looks confused, then smiles at the ruse. Hits the com:

          THE OPERATIVE
          Vessel in range, lock on...

          (ADMIRINGLY)
          Bastard's not even changing
          course...

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

           As Serenity get a bit closer, FIFTY REAVER SHIPS suddenly
           burst from the cloud, also heading straight at us.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          The Operative -- and everyone around him - goes big-eyed.

          THE OPERATIVE
          That's not good...

          HELMSMAN

          (FREAKING)

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity suddenly lists hard to port -- until she's almost
          upside down -- the Alliance ships FIRE, missing Serenity but
           tagging a few Reaver ships, none of whom have slowed down --

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal is back on the bridge as we look out at the upside down
          Alliance fleet, missiles just passing us --

          MAL
          We're too close for them to arm --

          ZOE
          This is gonna be very tight --

          V0 Zoe and Mal shoot a look at Jayne.

          WASH
          (to himself)
          I am a leaf on the wind, watch how
          I soar.

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity slips right under the Operative's ship and ducks and
          weaves between dozens more. The Reaver force hits the
          Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that, smashing
          into bigger ships kamikaze-style, everything exploding --
          The fleet mobilizes, blasting Reaver ships, circling around,
          and an air war begins, a frenzied, balletic ecstasy of
          destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and
          parts of ships fly at and past it.

          ANGLE: SERENITY
          She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet
          before a barrelling chunk of debris -- which is twice their
          size -- forces them to come hard about and remain in the fray.

          J INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

           Mal looks out at the chaos...

           MAL
           Chickens come home to roost...
           They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another
           ship -- Wash struggles to control her --

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity makes her way past the carnage and heads down toward
          the tiny satellite moon.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          As the vessel shakes, clearly breached, The Operative moves
          to a door marked: DART. He puts his thumb to a panel and the
          door slides up to reveal a standing, almost formfitting one-
          man cockpit.

          EXT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - CONTINUING

          The Dart disengages and bullets down towards the surface. As
          it moves from the Operative's ship, we see that a Reaver
          vessel has smashed into the main viewshield, and the ship is
          spinning, explosions popping silently all over it.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          She continues down, the metallic expanse of Mr Universe's
          little moon complex sprawling below them. A moment after
          Serenity blows through frame, so does a Reaver ship.
          It fires an electronic pulse at Serenity and sparks fly.

           Kaylee jumps back as she is electrocuted -- Simon runs in and
           pulls her out, slams the door shut on the erupting fires.

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

          We can see it, a long strip, which halfway along becomes a
          kind of hanger. Serenity arcs at it uncomfortably fast.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Wash is fighting the stick with extreme concentration as Zoe
          pulls out a seat as well, straps in.

          INT. AFT HALL - CONTINUING

          Jayne, Simon and Inara pull harnesses not unlike "Batman the
          Ride" seats from the ceiling, help the others in.

          EXT./INT. LANDING STRIP/HANGER - CONTINUING

          -40 And Serenity HITS the ground -- the landing gear folds and
          snaps under the weight -- the ship keeps going, now inside
          the hanger, heading towards the entrance to the facility,
          slowing, fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it
          goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian
          area, so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but
          the body of the ship is hidden from it.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          There is a moment of quiet.

          WASH
          I am a leaf on the wind. Watch --
          A massive harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales
          him to his chair. It's as thick around as a telephone pole.
          Wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead.

          WASH!
          She moves to him --

          VW please --
          Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile
          slams through the window into the wall above them.

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

          We see the ship that has fired the harpoons as Reavers start
          out of it. A second Reaver vessel enters frame from above,
          about to land next to it.

          EXT. SERENITY - MOMENTS LATER

          The cargo bay door opens -- just the little door housed
          inside the ramp -- and Jayne comes out with his biggest gun.
          He looks up, toward the edge of the runway, but no Reavers
          have arrived yet.

          JAYNE
          Go!
          The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons.

          MAL
          Head inside!

          INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          A small double-sized doorway leads to the "Black Room", which
          is the entrance proper to the facility.
          Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the
          sides AND the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square
          hole getting bigger. The hall itself is smaller than the
          black room, but still has the arrows on the ceiling, that
          point to an elevator some fifty feet away.

          MAL
          Come on. Jayne, rearguard.
          Zoe slows, looking around her.

          ZOE

          No. They have to come through

          ,oO
          back there's the blast doors.

          KAYLEE
          I can rig 'em so they won't re-
          open once they close.

          Then shut 'em and hide til --

          ZOE
          We need to draw them til it's
          done. This is the place. We'll
          buy you the time.

          JAYNE
          (to the others)
          Move those crates back there for
          cover -- and make sure they ain't
          filled with anything goes boom.

          KAYLEE
          Wait, Wash -- where's Wash?
          Nobody (but River) realized he wasn't there. Zoe is dead calm.
          ,No ZOE
          He ain't comin'.
          Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up.

          JAYNE
          Move the gorram crates! Come on!
          We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- they're
          approaching. Mal moves to the door, Jayne beside him.

          ANGLE: HIS POV
          Reavers rush toward them.
          He turns to Jayne.

          MAL
          Tell me you brought 'em this
          time...
          Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own
          and fastballs it at the Reavers.

          It explodes in their midst, smoke and man-parts flying about.
          Mal rolls his a shorter distance, then slams the door shut.

          ANGLE: THE GRENADE

          40
          Explodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a
          catwalk -- right in front of the door.
          In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the
          explosion. Everyone takes positions behind the crates. Zoe
          stands calmly, her back to the door, loading her sawed-off.

          MAL
          (continuing; moving
          back to Zoe)
          Zoe... are you here?
          She looks up at him.

          ZOE
          Do the job, sir.

          MAL
          You hold. Hold till I'm back.
          He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look
          for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone.
          Jayne moves over to Zoe.

          10

          JAYNE
          Captain's right. Can't be
          thinking on revenge if we're gonna
          get through this.

          ZOE
          You really think any of us are
          gonna get through this?
          He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a
          mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River. A beat,
          and he looks back at Zoe with forlorn hope:

          JAYNE
          I might...

          The elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of
          screens and machines in the center of the space.
          The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has
          been destroyed. The second:

          his equally still lovebot. A trail of blood shows he crawled
          from his chair.

          Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away again and
          the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible
          whir. She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness,
          and a warped, computery version of Mr Universe's voice.

          Mal stops.

          LOVEBOT

          Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me
          with a sword. How weird is that?
          I got... a short span here... they
          destroyed my equipment but I have
          a back-up unit... bottom of the
          complex, right over the generator.
          Hard to get to. I know they
          missed it. They can't stop the
          signal, Mal. They can never stop
          the signal.

          (BEAT)
          Okay this is painful. On many
          levels. I'm not --

          She turns back, powering down. Recording over.
          A beat, and Mal takes off.

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

          Inara is on her knees, unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her
          shuttle. River is in the corner, clutching her head.

          Jayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her.

          JAYNE
          She picked a sweet bung of a time
          to go helpless on us.

          ZOE
          (calls out)
          Jayne and I take the first wave.
          Nobody shoots less they get past
          our fire.
          Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on
          the door continue.

          KAYLEE
          Oh, I didn't plan on going out
          like this. I think we did right,
          but...

          SIMON
          I never planned... anything. I
          just wanted to keep River safe.
          Spent so much time on Serenity
          trying to find us a home I never
          realized I already had.
          She looks at him with soft surprise.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          My one true regret in all this is

          With me? You mean to say, as, sex?

          SIMON

          (SMILES)
          I mean to say.
          Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than
          we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the door.

          KAYLEE
          Hell with this. I'm gonna live.
          Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the
          door.
          Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth:
          a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace.

          Mal has reached it and surveys the situation.
          Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the
          generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and
          grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it.
          On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console
          sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains
          run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs.

          MAL
          Hard to get to. That's a fact.

          The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to
          squeeze through and charge.
          Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard
          as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward
          the door --

          JAYNE
          Zoe... Gorramnit...
          But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the
          bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots,
          each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo.
          The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the
          precision of military training still in her as she flips him,
          wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame,
          bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open
          and she's rushed from behind ---
           But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot,
          moving forward himself --

          ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line!
          voï¿½ She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets
          comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a
          blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in
          his neck.
          Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - LATER

          Mal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the
          ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong
          move and he pitches into the jaws of death...
          A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs
          sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the
          backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he
          falls, mercifully, back onto the platform.
          The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot
          as Mal gets shakily up.

          MAL
          (in pain)
          Shot me in the back. I haven't...
          made you angry, have I?
          I s

          THE OPERATIVE
          There's a lot of innocent people
          in the air being killed right now.

          MAL
          You have no idea how true that is.
          There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing
          off at ten paces.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          I know the secret now. The truth
          that burned up River Tam's brain
          and set you after her. And the
          rest of the 'verse is gonna know
          it too. 'Cause they need to.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You really believe that?

          MAL
          I do.

          112.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You willing to die for that belief?

          MAL

          V0
          I am.
          The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw
          master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets
          two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Of course, that ain't exactly plan

          A..
          He drops out his cartridge and slams another in.
          The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out
          at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover.
          Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts
          going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can.
          The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's
          been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death
          in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and
          grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.
          He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
          4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
          Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and
          pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes
          swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
          He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
          the platform from above.

          INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          Jayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to
          the barricades. Simon moves to help -- Kaylee firing now,
          squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoe's
          shirt, checks the wound.

          SIMON
          Spine's intact --

          ZOE
          Just gimme a bandage.
          Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag, sprays the wound with a
          foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering.

          113.
          There are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades)
           from the Reavers. Jayne switches weapons, tossing another to
          Zoe and opening fire --

          A0

          JAYNE
          Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh?
          Cheaters!
          He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing.
          River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and
          starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like
          projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the
          projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as
          Zoe shouts:

          ZOE
          Everybody fall back! Fall back!
          Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor.
          Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close, from
          each side and above and below. Then, when the hole is maybe
          four by four, they stop.

          ZOE

          (CONTINUING)
          Jayne! Grenade!

          JAYNE
          Very last one...
          He tosses it through the hole. Zoe doesn't even flinch from
          the blast as she thinks.

          ZOE
          They're gonna get in --

          KAYLEE
          Can close it... from outside...

          ZOE
          No one's coming back from that...
          She tries to stand, fails.

          ZOE

          (CONTINUING)
          How much ammo do we have?

          JAYNE
          We got three full cartridges and
          my swingin' cod. That's all.
          Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come.---

          ZOE
          When they come, try to plug the
          hole with 'em...
          Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her.

          KAYLEE
          I'm starting to lose some feeling
          here... I think there's something
          in them darts they throwed at me.

          SIMON
          Lie still. I'm gonna give you
          something to counteract the --
          He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by Zoe.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          My bag.
          and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
          suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot
          lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
          right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air.
          River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make.
          Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs
          cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it.

          INARA
          Keep pressure here...

          SIMON
          My bag. Need... adrenaline... and
          a shot of calaphar for Kaylee...
          I can't... River...?
          She is by his side, takes his hand. She has a kind of
          serenity to her, like she understands something now.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River... I'm sorry...

          RIVER
          No. No.
          The lights go out. Everyone looks about them. Jayne fires
          again, but all the sound has bled out save these two.

          I hate to... leave...

          RIVER
          You won't. You take care of me,
          Simon. You've always taken care
          of me.
          She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face
          an unearthly glow as she looks down at him.

          RIVER

          (CONTINUING)
          My turn.
          She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES
          through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name,
          the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
          lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers.
          Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets
          the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the
          back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of
          Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second
          her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her.
          The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm
          over her.
          ANGLE: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a shuddering RLUNG.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal gets up the chain to the platform. The Operative is on
          Mal before he gets his footing, tackles him as Mal's gun goes
          skittering over the edge into oblivion. There is a railing
          here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with
          a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him.
          They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest,
          knocking over tools and computer parts.
          The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
          gracefully from the holster under his jacket.
          Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver.
          He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets
          inside sword range and tries for the neck with the
          screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword
          point against the edge of Mal's stomach. Starts pushing
          slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin.

          116.
          Mal looks at the Operative a moment -- and the sword slides
          all the way through Mal's belly. Mal's eyes go wide.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You know what your sin is, Malcolm?

          MAL
          (shaky smile)
          Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven.
          He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so
          hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The
          Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the
          screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it,
          gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck
          in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin.
          The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword
          still in his belly.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          But right now...
          He pulls the sword out, grimacing. Holds it over the
          Operative. The smile gone.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          vao I'm gonna have to go with Wrath.
          He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls
          out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground and is up in a
          second, grabbing Mal's sword hand -- the sword drops -- and
          punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound.

          INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUING

          The gang is subdued -- because they are all of them injured
          and Simon is slipping away. Jayne looks at Zoe.

          JAYNE
          You suppose he got through? Think
          Mal got the word out?

          ZOE
          (almost convincingly)
          He got through. I know he got
          through.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal goes down hard, spitting up blood. He sees the sword,
          moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face. Picks him
          lod up, Mal too tired to throw a decent punch.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm sorry.
          The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right
          into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias
          with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain.
          The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword.
          Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          You should know there's no shame
          in this. You've done remarkable
          things. But you're fighting a war
          you've already lost.
          He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way,
          grabbing the Operative's swordhand and pulling it forward --
          while driving his elbow into the Operative's neck with
          staggering force.

          MAL
          Iwo Well, I'm known for that.
          The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back,
          unable to make a sound.
          Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own
          through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
          arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we
          hear his arms crack.
          Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his
          sword, saying:

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Piece a shrapnel tore up that
          nerve cluster my first tour. Had
          it moved.
          He squats down, looks the Operative in the face.

          Sorry 'bout the throat. Expect
          you'd wanna say your famous last
          MW words now. Just one trouble.
          He reaches over the railing, pulls the back of the
          Operative's jacket through and shoves the sword through the
          fabric, pinning the Operative in his sitting position.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          I ain't gonna kill you.
          He moves to the console, starts prepping it.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Hell, I'm gonna grant your
          greatest wish.
          He inserts the cylinder, turns it slightly. It hums to life.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          I'm gonna show you a world without
          sin.
          He hits "send all". The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
          V0 begins. Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on
           the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative.
           There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the
           street, in homes and offices... image after image, jus.t as
           we saw on the research vessel -- and in River's mind.

           CARON (V.0.)
          These are some of the first sites
          we scouted on Miranda. There is
          no one living on this planet.
          There is no one...
          Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other
          side. He begins to cross. Never even looks back.
          On the Operative, trapped, watching in growing horror...

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

          CLOSE ON: A Reaver in EXTREME SLOW MOTION. Face full of
          fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate.

          the Reaver clearing frame to reveal:

          River.
          She is bloodied, but not killed. She's as she was in the
          bar -- moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can,
          ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are
          piles of Reavers already, she never breaks concentration as
          she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does
          everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
          above -- the mob.
          She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
          and a grappling hook punches through it, just missing her.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          The Operative watches the end of the broadcast. We are on
          his face through the clear plastic, so the images projected
          on it blur right before him: the Reaver, Dr. Caron -- and her
          screaming doesn't stop til something is shoved in her mouth.

          INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUING

          The gang is still trying to patch themselves together when
          the elevator doors open. Mal staggers out, holding his
          bleeding side.

          ZOE
          Sir?

          140 MAL
          It's done. Report?
          Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a
          report -- and the doors start to open behind her.
          Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons,
          as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
          reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver
          blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive.
          We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped
          completely away.
          Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
          wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance
          soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang...

          SOLDIER
          Drop your weapons! Drop 'em now!

          Mal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the
          soldiers, blades still gripped... A soldier levels his gun at
          her, sweaty and frantic... others still shouting...
          vp INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
          The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com:

          a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into
          the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but
          glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of
          those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his
          lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
          stone beneath.
          The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone,
          40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial
          Book.
          The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash.
          The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses
          a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
          instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper
          to it is River.
          She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're
          flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves),
          Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
          with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side.
          There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing.
          Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown,
          holding a burning taper.
          She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to
          the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others.
          The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch
          its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series
          of fireworks.

          121.
          WIDE ON the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads.
          We are close on another explosion when it becomes:
          CLOSE ON: A BLOWTORCH spitting sparks. Widen to see:

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY

          Zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship, welding on a
          replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash
          came through.

          INT. DUCT INSIDE SERENITY - DAY

          We are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just
          above the engine room, replacing wires. Some of them run to
          a computer screen that she checks and adjusts.

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/TOP OF SERENITY - DAY

          Mal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it
          off the top of the ship.
          Close on Mal as he watches it go...

          WIDER ANGLE:

           EXT. REPAIR YARD - CONTINUING

          t f o And here we see the whole ship for the first time, harnessed
          by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all
          over. The cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of
          repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly.

          INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY

          Kaylee, deeply greasy, tweaks a part on the engine and
          crosses to the back where Simon, shirtless and not entirely
          ungreasy himself, is wrenching a bolt into place above his
          head. A moment looking at him and she can't help herself -
          she slides her arms around his chest...

          EXT. SERENITY - DAY

          On a scaffold, Inara repaints the name on the nose with
          elegant precision.

          INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY

          Kaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends, work
          completely forgotten. With nothing resembling elegant
          precision, they sink out of frame to the floor.

          V0

          

          

          

          

          122.
          A beat, and River's head appears from the crawlspace above,
          looking down at them with detached curiosity.

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY

          It's raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair
          equipment. The camera moves around him, skirting the ground
          of the junkyard, till it lands on a figure in foreground,
          standing watching him from some twenty feet away.
          Mal stops, doesn't turn. Hand near his gun.

          MAL
          If you're here to tell me we ain't
          finished... then we will be real
          quick.
          The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the
          ship, framed by the rain behind.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Do you know what an uproar you've
          caused? Protests, riots -- cries
          for a recall of the entire
          Parliament.

          MAL

          (TURNING)
          We've seen the broadwaves.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You must be pleased.

          MAL
          'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be
          long 'fore she rolls right over
          and falls back asleep. Taint my
          worry.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I can't guarantee they won't come
          after you. The Parliament. They
          have a hundred men like me and
          they are not forgiving.

          MAL
          That don't bode especially well
          for you... giving the order to let
          us go, patching up our hurt...

          THE OPERATIVE
          I told them the Tams were no
          longer a threat -- damage done.

          (MORE)

          VO

          

          

          

          

          123.
          THE OPERATIVE (cont'd)
          They might listen, but... I think
          they know I'm no longer their man.

          W MAL
          They take you down, I don't expect
          to grieve overmuch. Like to kill
          you myself, I see you again.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You won't. There is...
          (small, grim smile)
          .nothing left to see.
          Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head
          inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops
          to look up at the nose of the ship.
          ANGLE: the newly painted Serenity, standing tall in the rain.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          "Serenity". You lost everything
          in that battle. Everything you
          had, everything you were... how
          did you go on?
          Mal hits the button to close the inner doors, steps inside as
          they slide together. Glances at the Operative, unimpressed.

          VAO

          MAL
          You still standing there when the
          engine starts, you never will
          figure it out.
          The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          Mal stows the gear as Zoe approaches.

          MAL
          (to himself)
          What a whiner...

          ZOE
          Sir, we have a green light.
          Inspection's pos and we're clear
          for upthrust.

          MAL
          Think she'll hold together?

          J

          

          

          

          

          124.

          ZOE
          She's tore up plenty. But she'll
          fly true.

          VW
          A beat between them before:

          MAL
          Make sure everything's secure.
          Could be bumpy.

          ZOE
          Always is.
          She takes off and Mal heads up the stairs.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING

          Mal comes in and runs into Inara. Jayne passes through as
          they talk, heading down into his bunk. Pays them no mind.
          Neither do Simon and Kaylee, in the dining room stowing
          supplies.

          MAL
          We're taking her out. Should be
          about a day's ride to get you back
          to your girls.

          INARA
          Right.

          VW

          MAL
          (moving past her)
          You ready to get off this heap and
          back to a civilized life?

          INARA
          I, uh...
          (he stops)
          I don't know.
          He looks at her, a smile in his eyes.

          MAL
          Good answer.
          He turns and heads into the bridge.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal eases himself into his seat. Takes a moment to adjust
          one of Wash's dashboard dinosaurs, then looks to his left.

          4

          

          

          

          

          125.

          MAL
          You gonna ride shotgun, help me
          fly?
          V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the
          screens and buttons.

          RIVER
          That's the plan.

          MAL
          Think you can work out how to get
          her in the --
          She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship
          hums to life.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          Her engines fire up and tilt. She lifts gently off the
          ground.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal looks slightly, only slightly nonplussed.

          MAL
          Okay, clearly some aptitude for
          the... but it ain't all buttons
          A0 and charts, .
          You know what the first rule of
          flying is? Well, I suppose you
          do, since you already know what
          I'm about to say.

          RIVER
          I do. But I like to hear you say
          it.
          He looks out at the rain on his windows, at his screens,
          taking her up as he says:

          MAL
          Love. You can learn all the math
          in the 'verse, but you take a boat
          in the air you don't love, she'll
          shake you off just as sure as the
          turning of worlds. Love keeps her
          in the air when she oughta fall
          down, tells you she's hurting
          'fore she keens. Makes her a home.
          River also looks out at the sky.

        

          126.

          RIVER
          Storm's getting worse.

          MAL
          We'll pass through it soon enough.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          As we shoot up with her through sheeting rain, towards the
          top of the sky.

          EXT. SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

          We are looking down on the stormclouds as Serenity bursts out
          of them, comes at us, flared by the sun behind the planet as
          she passes us, her Firefly effect lighting up, about to shoot
          off into the heavens --
          There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off, whips at
          camera, blacking out the frame.

          MAL (0. S . )
          What was that?



          THE END

                                                 September 29, 2008


                                                     1.


    FADE IN:

1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1

    Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET
    LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full
    moon.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               The year was 1891. London was the
               capital of the world -- the height
               of modernity, with the hiss of
               steam and smell of coal in the
               air. It was also the great
               cesspool into which all the
               sinners and criminals of the
               empire drained.

    Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a
    POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making
    his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               I had come to London, ten years
               prior, to find a life after the
               Afghan war. I had hoped to start
               a medical practice and settle into
               a nice, steady existence. The
               life I found was anything but nice
               and steady.

    We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive
    silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A
    FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.
    The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing
    stampede.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               And that had everything to do with
               one man. My friend, my partner,
               my burden...

    The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the
    impression that he knows something that we don't.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               ... Sherlock Holmes.

    WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by
    A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,
    his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                     2.
1   CONTINUED:                                                       1
    The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
    just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies
    it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he
    recognizes his famous assailant.

                            MAN
              Sherlock Holmes?!

    SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the
    MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken
    umbrella.

                            HOLMES
              My apologies. Send the bill to
              John Watson, 221B Baker Street.

    Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN
    takes a step into the road to watch him go --

    -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a
    number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious
    pursuit, Victorian-style.

2                                                                    2
    INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT
    inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a
    19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,
    older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.

    A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:
    DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in
    the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A
    thinking man of action.

3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3

    Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the
    Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the
    river.

    As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the
    carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot
    follow.

                                                           CUT TO:


    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and
    runs across a courtyard to a side door.

    WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.

                                                    3.


4   OMITTED                                                      4


5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5

    Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a
    stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but
    not as fit as he used to be.

    Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral
    staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers
    round the corner.

    A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards
    Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the
    door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying
    the lantern and a gun.

    He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the
    shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his
    black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the
    lantern away again. He peers about, confused.

    We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his
    jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Head cocked to the left, partial
              deafness in right ear. First
              point of attack.


    PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED

    FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the
    top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes
    launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400
    fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's
    head is thrown back as he spins round.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Then throat, paralyze vocal
              chords, stop screaming.

    BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We
    RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck
    with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --
              knuckles to liver.

    BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating
    knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted
    thug and crumples him to his knees.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                     4.
5   CONTINUED:                                                       5
    SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE

    Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we
    can barely see what he's doing.

    THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.
    CRACK! Karate chop to throat.
    WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.

    BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,
    Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it
    onto his own in one super fast move.

    Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his
    lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.


    POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE

    Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the
    staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his
    gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the
    post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the
    shadows.

                            THUG
              What's goin' on, John?

    When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where
    we saw Holmes hide.

    But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,
    reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips
    him twice with his own gun, dropping him.

    Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and
    sniffs it appreciatively.

                            HOLMES
              Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you
              work for?

    He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the
    man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the
    crypts.

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight.
    Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when --

    A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder.    PULL BACK to
    reveal --

    (The following exchange in whispers.)

                              HOLMES
              Watson.    Perfect timing.

                              WATSON
              Nice hat.

                              HOLMES
              Just got it.    Where's Lestrade?

                            WATSON
              Getting his troops in formation.
              Is that your blood or theirs?

                              HOLMES
              I don't know.    It's an old shirt.

                            WATSON
              You left this behind.

    Watson hands him his pistol.    Holmes looks at it with
    distaste, doesn't take it.

                            HOLMES
              Knew I'd forgotten something.
              Thought I'd left the stove on.

                              WATSON
              You did.

                              HOLMES
              Right.    Shall we?

    This is what they do.    This is what they like.

                                                              CUT TO:

    The two HARD MEN on guard turn fast and gather together
    as they hear footsteps approaching.

    He can see the hat, but not the man underneath.

                            WATSON
              Yeah, s'me.

     Watson takes out the two men. He is more of a brawler,
     using headbutts, knees, and elbows. Less artful, but no
     less effective.

9    INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT                      9

     Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a
     chilling sight.

     A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE
     (five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner.
     Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has
     been placed at her feet.

     A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the
     pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his
     face.

     ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony,
     shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.

     Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if
     pulled to her feet by invisible hands.

     Some kind of ritual is about to climax.

     Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they
     make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo.

9A                                                                9A
     INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS
     The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the
     shadows.

     Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly,
     Latin incantation repeating and repeating.

     ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the
     incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.

     Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's
     level.

     Blackwood simply ignores them.   The Latin incantation
     never stops.

     Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood.

                             WATSON
               The girl.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

     The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness,
     picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to
     plunge the point into her heart.

     Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and
     pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.

     Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a
     rush of air departs the tunnel.

     Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face.
     His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark
     and cruel.

     Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity.

                             WATSON
               Lord Blackwood?!
     Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Well done, Holmes. And Watson as
               well.

     Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood.

                             WATSON
               Stay right there.

     Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost
     mockingly.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Tell me, doctor, as a medical man,
               how did you like my work?
                    (beat)
               The fifth one was so scrawny, it
               was over before I'd finished the
               first incision.

     That's more than Watson can take.   He moves in to pistol-
     whip Blackwood --

     -- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his
     collar.

                             HOLMES
               No.

     Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.

                             HOLMES
               Look.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.   Watson looks,
     sees nothing.

                               HOLMES
               Look.

     Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide.

     INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end
     of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost
     invisible --

     -- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.    A
     really nasty concealed weapon.

     One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.

                               BLACKWOOD
               What a shame.    That would've been
               fun.

     We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his
     men finally appear.

     POLICEMEN flood the area.

                             HOLMES
               Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

                             LESTRADE
                    (vis Blackwood)
               Is that -- ?

                               WATSON
               It is.

                             HOLMES
                    (re: girl)
               We've gone for the doctor...
                    (re: Blackwood)
               And one for the rope.

                             LESTRADE
               You should've waited for my help.

                             HOLMES
               If I had, you'd be cleaning up a
               corpse and chasing a rumor.
               Besides, the girl's parents hired
               me, not the Yard.
                    (a wry smile)
               I can't imagine why they thought
               you'd need any assistance.

      Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank
      Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him,
      while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's
      still mouthing the incantation.

      Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his
      head, not understanding them.

      Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to,
      he turns to Holmes.

                               LESTRADE
                 What do you make of that?

                               HOLMES
                 Some kind of ceremony. Five girls
                 killed beneath cathedrals at the
                 height of the full moon.
                      (indicating)
                 The double circle's for his own
                 protection.

                               LESTRADE
                 London will breathe a sigh of

                 Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar.

      Holmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket
      and --

               I think we can start to wean you
               off the medicine --

     BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG! A dozen GUNSHOTS O.S.    Captain
     Philips hits the floor, terrified.

     Watson suppresses extreme irritation, writes a
     prescription on a piece of paper, then helps Captain
     Philips to his feet.

                             WATSON
               Let's give it a little longer,
               just to be safe.
                    (beat)
               I'll be right back.

     He heads out, letting his aggravation show once his back
     is turned to his patient.


13   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HALL                                    13

     As Watson exits his apartment and moves down the hall,
     MRS. HUDSON, his landlady, shoots up the stairs with the
     paper. Her nerves are almost as bad as Captain Philips'.

                             MRS. HUDSON
                    (panting)
               I won't go in there by myself, not
               while he's in this state.

                             WATSON
               You're not going in at all.

     Which is a relief to Mrs. Hudson.

                             MRS. HUDSON
               What will I do when you leave?
               He'll burn the house down around
               me. What will he do? Couldn't
               you have a longer engagement?

                             WATSON
               He just needs a new case, that's
               all.

     Captain Philips emerges from Watson's apartment, heads
     towards them.

                             WATSON
               I smell burning.

     Mrs. Hudson's already-frayed nerves take a turn for the
     worse. Watson takes the newspaper from her.

                             WATSON
               Why don't you take Captain Philips
               and give him a nice cup of tea.

                             MRS. HUDSON
               Come on, Captain, let's go down.
               It'll be quieter.

                             WATSON
                    (as they leave)
               And perhaps some tea and bread up
               here when you can.

     Watson heads down the hallway to the last door. A
     tendril of smoke wafts out from under it. Urgent.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

     Nonetheless, Watson   stops, takes a deep breath, gathers
     himself. Something    like this has happened before (is, in
     fact, Holmes' usual   brand of chaos) the difference being,
     now, that Watson is   sick to death of dealing with it.

     Which doesn't mean he won't.

     Newspaper in hand, Watson opens the door, pokes his head
     in, cautiously. He sees --


14   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS                       14

     Watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the                
     obstruction is Holmes who is sitting in the dark on a               
     chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd                 
     contraption fastened on its barrel) at the wall.                    

     Unadulterated chaos. A series of FLAMING BULLET HOLES               
     blasted into the wall in the (ragged) initials "V.R."

                             WATSON                                      
               May I join you in the armory?                             

                             HOLMES                                      
               Please... Watson, I've been                               
               working on a device which will                            
               suppress the sound of a gunshot.                          

     Watson heads towards the conservatory.                              

                             HOLMES                                      
               Please... Don't, don't, don't...                          

     Watson pulls open the curtains allowing the light to pour           
     in.

               It needs work.     May I see?...                          

     Watson passes him heading to the other side of the room             
     (possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open                  
     letters from a table.

               Gently, gently, Watson...                                 

     Watson whips open more curtains and opens a window.                 

     Holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table                
     where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on.                     

     Watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the                
     letters.

     A little smile from Holmes.

               Then it's not official.

               Half past eight. The Royale.

               And wear a jacket.

     Watson exits, leaving Holmes alone in his own chaos.
     For the first time, we see a hint of fear in his eyes.

                                                       CUT TO:

15   INT. THE ROYALE - DINING ROOM                               15

     Holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for Watson
     to arrive. He is quite uncomfortable in this setting.

     WE SEE HIS OBSERVATIONS -- he picks up little pieces of
     information from the other guests. He notices the
     details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a
     bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters.
     It all becomes quite overbearing.

     And then Watson and Mary arrive, talking, intent on each
     other -- surprised when they realize Holmes is already
     there.

                              WATSON
               Holmes!   You're early.
                              HOLMES
               Fashionably.

                             WATSON
               May I present Miss Mary Morstan.

     Holmes looks at MARY MORSTAN -- looks again. She's
     beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying.
     Holmes stands. She extends her hand.

                             HOLMES
               My pleasure. For the life of me I
               don't know why it's taken him so
               long to get us properly
               introduced.

     Holmes gestures politely, they sit, Mary and Watson on
     either side of him. There is a decanted bottle of wine
     on the table.

                             MARY
               The pleasure's mine. It really is
               a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes.

               They can seem a bit far-fetched
               sometimes, though. Making these
               grand assumptions out of tiny
               details.

                             HOLMES
                    (livening up)
               Oh, no no. The little details are
               by far the most important. Take
               Watson...

                              MARY
               I intend to.

     Watson likes that, Holmes less so -- a forced chuckle.

                             HOLMES
               ... see that walking-stick? A
               rare African snakewood hiding a
               blade of high-tensile steel. A
               few were awarded to veterans of
               the Afghan war, so I can assume
               he's a decorated soldier. Strong,
               brave, born to be a man of action.
               And neat, like all military men.
               Then I check his pockets... ah. A
               stub from a boxing match. Now I
               can infer he's a bit of a gambler.
                    (a wink)
               I'd keep an eye on that, by the
               way.

                             WATSON
               Those days are behind me.

                              HOLMES
               Yes, right behind you.
                     (leaning in to Mary)
               He's cost us the rent more than
               once.

     Mary laughs.

                              MARY
               With all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
               you know him. But what about a
               perfect stranger? What can you
               tell about me?

     Holmes and Watson exchange a glance -- not a good idea.

                             WATSON
               I don't think that's necessary --

                  You insist?
                       (at Watson)
                  She insisted.
                       (instantly)
                  You're a governess.

                                MARY
                  Well done.

                  Charlie's 7, actually.

     Watson's getting nervous, reaches for the wine.     Holmes
     stops him.

                                HOLMES
                  It's breathing.
                       (back to Mary)
                  Then he's tall for his age.

     Mary nods.

     The WAITER appears.

               There's nothing wrong with your
               face.

                             WAITER
               The gentleman has already ordered
               for himself.
                    (to Watson)
               What would madam care for this
               evening?

     Watson gives Holmes a hard look:   that's a bit much.

                             WATSON
               Give us a few minutes, please.

     He shakes his head, pours wine for all.

                             HOLMES
               There are two drops on your ear...
               India blue's nearly impossible to
               wash off, anyway. A very
               impetuous act by the boy, but
               you're too experienced to react
               rashly -- which is why the lady
               you work for lent you that
               necklace. It's from Asprey's,
               flawless, not the gems of a
               governess.
                    (beat)
               However, the jewels you're not
               wearing tell us rather more.

               Holmes.

     Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes.
     Holmes pauses... pauses, then:

                             HOLMES
               You were engaged.

     Holmes' mind has gotten away from him.   He begins talking
     faster, intensely focused, manic.

                             HOLMES
               The ring is gone. But the lighter
               skin where it sat suggests you
               spent some time abroad wearing it
               proudly.

     As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to
     her feet. They're leaving.

                             HOLMES
               Or at least until someone informed
               you of its true and rather modest
               worth, at which point you broke
               off the engagement and returned to
               England for better prospects. A
               doctor perhaps.

     Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The
     restaurant goes silent. She turns to leave, turns back.

                             MARY
                    (low)
               Right on all counts but one. I
               didn't leave my fiance... he died.

     Now she leaves --

       Holmes lets the wine drip down over him.

                                 HOLMES
                 She's lovely.

       Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down
       his face.

       Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high.
       The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds
       his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt,
       spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to
       cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around.


       HOLMES' POV

       Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly,
       Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving.
       The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine
       china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --

       -- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a
       fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.

       NIGHT

       Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own
       blood from a split lip. It interests him.
       He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His
       opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists
       together and moves in.

       Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.


       HOLMES' POV

       The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and
       indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his
       experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him,
       the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.

       He's able to feel, not just think.    He is utterly in the
       moment.

       Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to
       his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning
       to move his head so that a punch grazes him.


       BACK TO SCENE

       McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes
       ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes
       even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect
       himself.

       Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches
       McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an
       obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely
       in control --

       -- until he notices a face at ringside.


       CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

       Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a
       slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective.

       Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound
       floods back into the room.

       McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and
       steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --

       He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.

       Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the
       cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns
       back to McMurdo, smiles.

                                HOLMES
                 Well done.   Thank you.

       Holmes begins walking away.

                                McMURDO
                 Oi!   We ain't done here.

                               HOLMES
                      (walking away)
                 Not done. Finished. And as I
                 said, thank you, it was most
                 pleasurable.

       Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and
       SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back
       of the head. The crowd falls silent.

       Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his
       hand.

                                  HOLMES
                   Hm.   Plymouth gin.

       He turns.   Steps back into the ring.

       The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from
       Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning
       McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:

       A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo
       braces for combat --

       Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,
       incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding
       combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big
       man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.

       McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning
       away before the giant hits the canvas.

       He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they
       like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.

       Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes
       strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed
       inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge
       swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.

18A                                                                   18A
       INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
       A candle shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone
       cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A
       full-scale riot is on.

       Five GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the
       doors to quiet the prisoners.

       The GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who
       is frozen on the spot.

                                 GUARD CAPTAIN
                   Charlie, what the hell's going on

                It's Jack, he tried to stop
                Blackwood from doing his spells.
                And now he's in some kind of fit.

      The Guard Captain continues around the corner. We see
      another guard, JACK, lies convulsing on the floor.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                     (to the prisoners in
                      the cell next to
                      Blackwood)
                You lot shut it!
                     (to the guards)
                Charlie, get, down here and get
                him to the infirmary.

      The guards pick Charlie up and carry him away.

      INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - NIGHT
      Blackwood sits dead center in the dark.   Eyes closed,
      WHISPERING ungodly sounds.

      On the walls the scrawls of a madman: wild symbols,
      sketches of animals, a headless sphinx, an upside-down
      cross. A hint of some method to his madness.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                All right, Blackwood, what's this
                all about?

                              BLACKWOOD
                I've a request.
                               GUARD CAPTAIN
                You don't get nothin' `til you
                stop this devil nonsense. That's
                a holy book --

      Blackwood closes his eyes again, resumes his soft murmur.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                     (louder)
                -- and you will respect it!

      Blackwood starts whispering FASTER.   LOUDER.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                Boy, you want me to muzzle you --

      Suddenly, the Captain starts COUGHING. He's confused.
      He coughs harder. Prisoners watch him stumble backwards.

     Blackwood keeps whispering.     The Captain falls to one
     knee, keeps coughing.

     Finally the Captain COUGHS SOMETHING UP, spits it out
     onto the stone floor. He looks down, horrified:

     It's a small CATHOLIC CROSS on a chain.

     Prisoners start SHOUTING.   The RAVEN at Blackwood's
     windowsill flutters away.   Other guards run up,
     terrified.

               Get him to the infirmary, now!

     Guards pull the Captain away. The remaining guard picks
     up the cross, stares at Blackwood, chilled. Blackwood's
     eyes snap open.

                             BLACKWOOD
               I've a request.

21   INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING RING - NIGHT       21

     The fighting is over and the pub is closing. Only a few
     people remain cleaning up, mopping the beer and blood.
     Watson enters fast, looks around, and moves upstairs.

22                                                                22
     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC
     Watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. With a
     look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes
     sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room.

     Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his VIOLIN.
     On the table next to him, an upside down BEER STEIN and
     an assortment of prescription medicine bottles.

     Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from
     lack of sleep.

     Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.
                             WATSON
               You know this is for eye surgery?

                             HOLMES
               I find that it lifts my spirits.

                             WATSON
               It's a pathological amorbic
               process, it increases tissue
               change and weakness. And you know
               what a black reaction comes on you
               afterwards.

     No answer. More scales. Watson approaches, sees Holmes
     has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep. The beer stein is
     full of FLIES all buzzing about.

               Look at this. If you play a
               chromatic scale, they move
               clockwise. As soon as you switch
               to a pentatonic scale --

     Holmes plays a different scale, the flies all stop
     moving, stick to the glass.

                             WATSON
                    (faking interest)
               Really? What about when you --
               oops --

     Watson picks up the glass, lets loose the flies. Holmes
     looks up; Watson's already moving for the door, pissed.

                 You're Blackwood's last request.
                 Says he has information he'll give
                 only to you.

     But Watson's already out the door.


23   EXT. LONDON - DAWN                                             23

     Watson and Holmes ride in a cab, passing familiar
     landmarks as the city comes to life. They sit in
     silence, tension hanging between them. Finally Holmes
     grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean
     white shirt.

     Watson looks out the window, frustrated. He sees THE
     HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE. Near ground
     level, workers take down a large BLACKWOOD STEEL sign.

                               HOLMES
                 Look at that structure. What has
                 it been? Five years' work
                 already? Are you aware that is
                 the first combination of bascule
                 and suspension bridge. Very
                 innovative.

     No reply.

     As Holmes is taking off his jacket, he reaches into his
     pocket and pulls out a wad of money.

                there so I laid your customary
                bet --

     Silence.   Holmes takes off his shirt.

                              HOLMES
                You're right... I'll keep it with
                your check book, locked safely
                away in my drawer.

     Silence.   Holmes pulls on the clean shirt.

                              HOLMES
                The opera house is featuring Don
                Giovanni and I could easily
                procure two tickets if you had
                some cultural inclination this
                evening.

     Silence.

                              HOLMES
                You have the grand gift of
                silence, Watson. It makes you
                quite invaluable as a companion.

     Watson punches him square in the face.

                              WATSON
                And your grand gift is the uncanny
                ability to demoralize people. I
                was aware she'd been engaged. She
                told me.
     Holmes rubs his jaw.

                              HOLMES
                So that's a `no' to the opera
                then?

     Watson's steaming.   Holmes puts on his vest.

                              WATSON
                That's my waistcoat.

                              HOLMES
                It's too small for you.

                              WATSON
                Well, it's my property and I want
                it back.

     out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns, looks out the
     opposite window.

     Already a CROWD is gathering outside the jail, papers are
     for sale, Blackwood's death is the headline. Religious
     zealots and occultists swarm. Police keep them away from
     the entrance. Holmes heads inside, Watson stops.

                             WATSON
               You go ahead. I've no business

     A pale, nervous GUARD leads Holmes down the shadowy
     corridor. All the cells are now EMPTY.

                             HOLMES
               Where are all the other prisoners?

                             GUARD
               We had to move `em, sir, otherwise
               we were going to have a riot on
               our hands. There's something
               about him... it's like he can get
               inside your head.

     Holmes can see how spooked the Guard is.

                             HOLMES
               I'm sure I can find my own way
               from here, if you have other
               duties to attend to.

                             GUARD
               Much obliged, sir. Thank you,
               thank you.

     The Guard high-tails it out of there.

     INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - DAY
     Holmes approaches Blackwood's cell, strolling
     insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In
     the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's
     reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting
     closer.

               QUOTE from Revelations tbd...

     Blackwood pauses, turns, sees Holmes.

     They share a smile -- two heavyweights sizing each other
     up.

                             HOLMES
               Love what you've done with the
               place.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Thank you for joining me.

               A small point of concern.

                             BLACKWOOD
               How can I help?

                             HOLMES
               I'd already followed the murders
               with some interest and while my
               heart went out to the families of
               the victims, I couldn't but notice
               a criminal mastery in the stroke
               of your brush --

                             BLACKWOOD
               You're too kind.

                             HOLMES
               However, by comparison, your work
               in the crypt was akin to a finger
               painting.

     Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to
     Holmes.

                             BLACKWOOD
               So now you're curious as to
               whether there's a larger game
               afoot, and that's why you're
               really here.

                             HOLMES
               Actually, my friend will pronounce
               you dead shortly and I thought I
               might keep him company.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Allow me to enlighten you. Your
               mistake is to imagine that
               anything earthly has led to this
               moment. Your error in judgement
               is to assume I've been holding the
               brush at all -- I am merely the
               channel.

     Despite the bars between them, the men are close
     together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear.

               My only wish is that I'd caught
               you earlier. I might have spared
               five lives.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Those lives were a necessity, a
               sacrifice. Five otherwise
               meaningless creatures called to
               serve a greater purpose.

                             HOLMES
               I wonder if they'd let Watson and
               I dissect your brain -- after
               you're hanged, of course. I'd
               wager there's some deformity that
               would be scientifically
               significant. Then you would serve
               a greater purpose, too.

                              BLACKWOOD
               Mr. Holmes, you must widen your
               gaze. I'm concerned you
               underestimate the gravity of
               coming events.
                    (beat)
               For you and I are bound on a
               journey that will twist the very
               fabric of nature.
                    (beat)
               I sense fragility beneath your
               mask of logic, and it worries me.
               Steel your mind, Holmes, I need
               you.

     Holmes steps back, shakes his head.

                             HOLMES
               I must say, you've come a long way
               down from the House of Lords.

                             BLACKWOOD
               But I will rise again.

                             HOLMES
               Bon voyage, Blackwood.

     As Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Pay attention! Three more shall
               die, and there is nothing you can
               do to save them.

28   INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - MORNING                 28

     Holmes walks down the corridor, meets Lestrade and a
     PRIEST. The place is bustling with cops and officials.

                             LESTRADE
               What did he want?

                             HOLMES
               Nothing.

     Holmes looks at the priest.

                             HOLMES
               Don't think you're needed, Father.
               Not for this one.

     The room where the execution takes place is packed to the

     Watson is there too. Blackwood walks up into the noose.

     REVEAL: Irene Adler sits on the stairs near Holmes' lab,           
     cracking walnuts. She stands and Holmes watches her                
     every move as she crosses to him. She leans down,                  
     putting the walnuts in front of him and flashes him a              
     smile.

     Irene gets up to cross the room. Only once her back is             
     turned does Holmes lever himself upright, stunned by this          
     intrusion. As soon as she clears he quickly moves over             
     to a concealed safe. He tests the door to make sure it's           
     still locked.

               I prefer to travel in the winter.                        

     As she passes a small table that has been outfitted with           
     tea, dried fruit, olives, etc...

               I brought a few souvenirs. Dates                         
               from Jordan, tea from Ceylon and                         
               olives from Cyclades. I thought                          
               we'd have a little tea party to                          
               cheer us up.                                             

     Irene grabs a file from Holmes' desk.

               setting up.                                              

     Irene opens the file, flips through newspaper clippings            
     and police reports, her back to Holmes.

               He has a palace full of them.                            
               Let's not dwell on the past.                             

     They move to sit at the table.                                     

                             IRENE                                      
               By the looks of things you're                            
               between cases at the moment.                             

                             HOLMES                                     
               And you, husbands. No ring?                              

                             IRENE                                      
               He snored. I'm Irene Adler again                         
               and I need your help to find                             
               someone. There's nobody more                             
               brilliant or who knows London                            
               better than you. Plus, it's a                            
               wonderful opportunity to see you                         
               again.                                                   

     TRACK INTO Irene's hypnotically beautiful eyes. Holmes             
     almost melts. Then, Irene reaches for something inside             
     her jacket and Holmes grabs her hand.                              

                             IRENE                                      
               Why are you so suspicious?                               

                             HOLMES                                     
               Should I answer chronologically or                       
               alphabetically?                                          

     Irene pulls out an ENVELOPE.

               This is all the information you

               Who are you working for?                                

     Just for a brief moment, she can't hide the anxiety in            
     her eyes.

     She stands and pulls out a large bag of coins.                   

                              HOLMES
               Keep your money. I didn't say I'd
               take the case.

     She ignores him. Holmes examines the envelope. On it is          
     stamped the letterhead of the Grand Hotel. She pauses            
     behind him as she exits.

               They gave me our old room.                             

     As she walks out she puts her photo back upright.                


31   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - STAIRS                                31

     Irene descends the stairs just as Watson is coming in.
     He lifts his hat, waits for her to pass --

                              IRENE
               Hello, John.

     -- does a speechless double-take when he sees who it is.
     Irene keeps moving.

                                                    34.


32   EXT. LONDON STREET                                             32

     We PICK UP Irene crossing a street. She passes a DARK
     ALLEYWAY. Pauses. Looks. She turns into the alley.
     HOLD ON the alley for a long beat. Too dark to see much
     in there.

                                                          CUT TO:


     IRENE

     emerges from the alley holding a lovely bunch of roses.
     She sniffs them appreciatively, walks on.

     IRENE

     approaches a waiting carriage, looks around her, gets in.

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. CARRIAGE
     Irene sits, turns to address a man-shaped shadow filling
     the opposite corner of the carriage. Before she can
     speak, a gesture from the shadow stills her. This is
     PROFESSOR MORIARTY.

     Irene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a
     complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the
     paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL
     ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, cracks open the carriage window and
     slides the folded paper partway out.

     Someone waiting outside takes the paper, and their
     footsteps clatter away.

     Moriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts
     moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene,
     finally prepared to engage with her.

                             MORIARTY
               I assume he'll do it?

                             IRENE
               Not for money, but for me.   I
               wager he'll find our man within
               twenty-four hours.

                             MORIARTY
               You wager?

               I'm certain.

                                MORIARTY
               A better word.     I sincerely hope
               it's accurate.

                                IRENE
               I --

     Suddenly, the coach comes to a halt, they lurch forward.


34   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            34

     A rough-looking BEGGAR wearing an eye patch has fallen
     under a wheel of the coach.

                                BEGGAR
               Ow, me leg!

               You run me over, sir, yes you did!

                             COACH DRIVER
               You fell right into the carriage!

     The Beggar is up, limping toward the window where
     Moriarty and Irene sit. He has disgusting blackened
     teeth.

                             BEGGAR
               A little charity would go a long
               way, yes it would, sir.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

     He reaches toward the window. Within a nanosecond,
     Moriarty extends his hand into which a PISTOL appears,
     delivered by a concealed mechanism (Travis Bickle style).

     The gun rests on the Beggar's forehead. The cold eyes of
     the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the
     Beggar, who backs off in fear. The carriage moves on.


35   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT                         35

     Holmes is washing his face in a basin on the other side
     of the room, completely transformed now, utterly alive.
     Watson approaches, very concerned, almost enraged.

                             WATSON
               Look at you, I can't believe you                           
               ran after her like a schoolboy                             
               again. Leaping about, all                                  
               aflutter. Are you a masochist?                             

                             HOLMES
               Allow me to explain.                                       

                             WATSON
               Don't you remember what she did to                         
               you? She turned you inside out,                            
               she made a proper idiot of you.                            
               I'm sorry, you were going to                               
               explain something...

               No, I don't agree. It's more than                         
               a technicality. You're

                  No, I'm just saying, one has

       Holmes plucks his violin, the notes play over a FLASHBACK
       of the previous scene, all from HOLMES' POINT OF VIEW.

36     FLASHBACK - INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT           36

       We see Irene step out.

                                IRENE
                  Why don't I see myself out.

       Once Irene leaves, he steps quickly to a window, and
       looks out to see her walking down Baker Street, turning
       down an alley. He bolts    into --


36A    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - CORRIDOR                               36A

       He sees Watson coming up the stairs. Before Watson can
       speak, Holmes snatches his coat and runs down the other
       end of the corridor. He JUMPS out the window to --


37     EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - REAR YARD                               37

       Holmes flies from the window and lands neatly on a tin
       roof. The jump to the next level is a more taxing
       prospect. Holmes weighs the distance and hurls himself
       down with a determined look. He lands just right.


37A-37D OMITTED                                               37A-37D

                                                       37.


38    EXT. COAL SHED                                                 38

      Holmes jumps off the shed, heads for the street one block
      over from Baker Street.


38A   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            38A

      He runs down the mews in great haste, stops at the same
      alley that Irene disappeared into -- but at the other
      side.

                                                          CUT TO:


      HOLMES' POV DOWN ALLEY

      from concealment:    Irene walks towards a MAN HOLDING A
      BUNCH OF ROSES.

                                 MAN WITH ROSES
                   Got some roses for you,
                   sweetheart. Cut you a deal `cos
                   you're so pretty.

                                 IRENE
                   Oh, how nice of you.

      Even without the man -- who is scrofulous and sly -- no
      woman in her right mind would go down this alley.

38B                                                                 38B
      INT. ALLEY
      The man with the roses beckons Irene forward. Another
      man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to
      grab her --

      -- and WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! Gets three cosh-strikes across
      the chin, dropping him immediately.

      Still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up
      against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth.

      Quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp
      knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to
      his collar. The move ends with Irene's finger over her
      own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet. He obeys,
      eyes bulging.

      Irene frisks him expertly. She's mugging the mugger.
      There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                     37A.
38B   CONTINUED:                                                  38B
                              IRENE
                Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look
                like yours, does it? And --
                naughty boy -- here's another
                one. I'll return them, shall I?

      She takes both wallets, takes the roses --

                              IRENE
                These are lovely, thank you.

      -- and leaves, stepping daintily over the crumpled man on
      the floor.

      On second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too,
      then leaves.

                                                           CUT TO:


      ANGLE ON HOLMES

                              HOLMES
                Now, that's the Irene I know.

      He hurries after Irene down the alley.

38C                                                                  38C
      EXT. LONDON STREET
      Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene
      through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled.

      Holmes picks up the pace.

      He snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his
      hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin
      and snatches the beggar's eye patch too.

      He runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it
      on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews
      it to blacken his teeth.

      He pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a
      fairground fire-breather's flames, runs on.


39    EXT. LONDON STREET                                              39

      Holmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. Again he
      stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this
      time we can see that Holmes gets a view of the man on the
      other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away.

                                                      37B.


40   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS (PRESENT)             40

     Holmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking.

     Irene's bag of money still sits on the table.                       

                             HOLMES
               This man intrigues me, Watson.                            
               He's got Adler on edge.                                   

                             WATSON
               Which is no mean feat.                                    

                             HOLMES                                      
               She's intimidated, scared...                              

                             WATSON                                      
               And yet she works for him. That's                         
               bad money. It's nothing to do                             
               with me, but leave this case.                             

     Holmes motions to the bills.

                             HOLMES
               Well, I may not have a choice. A                          
               man has to make a living. After                           
               all, I'll be paying the rent                              
               entirely on my own.

               You know what, I've had just about                        
               enough --

     He turns to see... CONSTABLE CLARK standing at the door.
     Breathless, pale, scared.

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               Inspector Lestrade asks that you
               come with me, at once.

               What's he done now, lost his way

               dead.

                             WATSON                             
               Well that's clever seeing as how I               
               pronounced him dead myself.

               morning.

                             WATSON
               I'll leave this one in your                      
               capable hands. I have tea with                   
               Mary and her parents this evening.               

     Watson walks into his office.                              

                             HOLMES
               It is not my reputation at stake                 
               here.

               Are you taking this seriously?                   

                             HOLMES                             
               Like it or not, it's a matter of                 
               professional integrity. No girl                  
               wants to marry a doctor who can't                
               tell if a man's dead or not.                     

     They all move to the exit.                                 

                             HOLMES                             
               Watson, you'd do well to hide your               
               medical certificates in case

     Clarky laughs.

41   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY                 41

     Judging by the estate, Blackwood comes from old money,
     and lots of it. We FOLLOW the carriage hurrying Holmes
     and Watson forward.


42   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT - DAY                           42

     Generations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble
     memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a
     bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain.

     A COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and
     Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS
     KIT.

     They walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family
     Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground
     while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump
     of trees in the distance.

                             WATSON
               Look at this mess. Nothing but
               standard-issue police bootprints.
               Any possible evidence there might
               have been has been trampled.

                             HOLMES
               Scotland Yard at their finest,
               once again.

     Police lamps light one large marble CRYPT. The cops are
     in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked.
     They'd rather be anywhere but here.

     As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors
     of the crypt have been BLASTED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.
     Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is
     interesting.

     Lestrade emerges from the crypt.   He is sweating, shaken.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

     Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves
     it off.

                             LESTRADE
               Look at those slabs of marble --
               they're half a ton each if they're
               a pound -- smashed outward like
               they were nothing.

     On second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes'
     handkerchief.

                             LESTRADE
               Explain it if you can, Holmes.

     Holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges. He
     notices the Blackwood CREST, and the image of a SPHINX.

                             HOLMES
               And the coffin?

                             LESTRADE
               We're digging it up now. The
               witness is over there. You can
               question him if you like -- but
               you won't get much.

     The old GROUNDSKEEPER, pale and terrified, stands out of
     the rain under an ancient cypress tree.

     Watson heads for him.   Holmes disappears in the opposite
     direction.

     As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over
     to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in
     each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want
     Holmes or Watson to hear this.

                             LESTRADE
                    (low, angry)
               If you lot don't stop behaving
               like a bunch of superstitious milk
               maids, you're on double-time!
               You're an embarrassment! Also,
               you're forbidden to talk about
               this to anyone, not a word. Are
               we bloody clear on that?

     The cops nod, duly chastened.

                                                         CUT TO:

     THE GROUNDSKEEPER

     mumbles the Lord's Prayer under his breath. Watson
     immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse,
     looking in his eyes.

     The Groundskeeper just keeps praying. Watson takes a
     boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth
     and gently sits him down.

     Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.

                                WATSON
               He's in shock.     We should give him
               a few moments.

     Lestrade stomps up.

                              LESTRADE
               The witness stated that he saw
               Lord Blackwood rise from the
               grave.
                     (at Watson,
                      accusingly)
               Well? You pronounced the man
               dead.

                             WATSON
                    (stung)
               He had no pulse.
                             HOLMES
               Inspector, do you know if this is
               a spruce or a sycamore?

     Lestrade shakes his head.    It hasn't been a good day for
     him, or the Yard.

     There's a clunk. They all turn to see the coffin has
     been extracted from the crypt.

     Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin.
     They place it on the ground, step back, crossing
     themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. Holmes
     chuckles.

                                LESTRADE
               OPEN IT!!

     But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if
     it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches
     forward --

     -- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and
     levers it off with a slow, eerie groan.

     Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward.

     The coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush
     away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the
     coffin. The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood,
     in everyday clothes, with red hair.

                             LESTRADE
               That's not Blackwood.

                              HOLMES
               Now that we have a firm grasp of
               the obvious...

     Watson opens his forensic kit, disturbed. Vials, silver
     tools. He takes a CALIPER, begins examining the body.

                             WATSON
               Lividity is late stage. Diptera
               deposits are approximately --
                    (measuring)
               -- three quarters of an inch,
               putting the time of death at ten
               to twelve hours ago.

                             HOLMES
               Inspector, may I see your pen?

     Lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned.
     Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth,
     revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw.

                             WATSON
               Missing two incisors in the upper
               jaw...
                    (a look at Holmes)
               Adler's midget.

     Holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled
     pocket. He uses the pen to fish out: a POCKET WATCH.

                             HOLMES
               All yours, Inspector.

     Holmes hands the pen back to Lestrade. Lestrade looks at
     it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a
     small measure of revenge.

       Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt.
       Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty
       pocket watch.

                               HOLMES
                 Scratches around the keyhole where
                 the watch is wound. Most drunks
                 are the same, and pawnbrokers
                 scratch the ticket number and
                 their initials inside the lid.
                 This one has five, so the owner --

                               GROUNDSKEEPER (O.S.)
                 He was walking.

       They all stop, suddenly. The old Groundskeeper stands in
       front of them, ready to unburden himself.

                               GROUNDSKEEPER
                      (quivering voice)
                 He was walking but his feet didn't
                 touch the ground. And I'm not
                 daft, I know what I saw and I know
                 Lord Blackwood. He was as alive
                 as you or me. It's not right.
                 It's not natural.
                      (turns, leaves)
                 Our Father Who art in heaven...
                 (etc.)

       All three men watch the Groundskeeper go. A sudden gust
       of wind moans eerily. They all want to get the hell out
       of there.

                               HOLMES
                 Now the game is afoot, Watson.

42A-50 OMITTE                                                  42A-50


51     EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                                     51

       Holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly
       observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes
       a bundle wrapped in newspaper.

                               WATSON
                 I fail to see how these fish and
                 chips are different from the three
                 other places we passed along the
                 way.

                                  HOLMES
                 Trust me.

               Just eat.

     Holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along.
     Watson appears preoccupied.

                             WATSON
               You know, I've seen things in war
               that I couldn't explain. I once
               heard a man predict his death,
               down to the number and placement
               of the bullet holes that killed
               him. You have to admit that a
               supernatural explanation is at
               least theoretically possible.

               Never theorize before you have
               data. Invariably, you end up
               twisting facts to suit theories,
               instead of theories to suit facts.
               Adler's midget is the key to this.

     Holmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his
     eye, and flips Reordon's watch open. He examines the
     lid.

                             HOLMES
               Hmm... scratches around the
               keyhole, what does that tell you?

                             WATSON
               The owner was most likely a drunk.
               Each time he wound the watch his
               hand would slip, hence the
               scratches.

                             HOLMES
               Very good, Watson! You've
               developed considerable powers of
               your own.

     Watson looks quite chuffed.

                             HOLMES
               Let's see now, there are several
               sets of initials scored into the
               lid.

     Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they
     turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A
     PAWN SHOP. His face falls.

                             HOLMES
               The most recent is M.H...

     Watson shakes his head.

               On the watch.

                                HOLMES
               I think not.

                             WATSON
               The time. Which leads me to
               deduce that I'm already late for
               my appointment with Mary. You
               remember, the one I was leaving
               for before you talked me into
               coming to dig up dead bodies with
               you.

     A GYPSY PALM READER approaches Watson as he turns to
     leave.

                             PALM READER
               Reckon your future, sir?

                             HOLMES
               Perhaps we do need a little help
               from the beyond.

                                WATSON
               No, thank you.

     She grabs his hand anyway.

                             PALM READER
               You need to hear what I have to
               tell you.

     Watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of
     her tone that he doesn't pull away.

                             PALM READER
               I see two men, brothers. Not in
               blood but in bond. I see the
               letters S and an L, no... wait, a

     Holmes and Watson look at each other.   She has their

     Watson looks at Holmes.

               I see a letter... the letter M...

               Patterned table clothes, china

     Watson snatches his hand away.

               You think you are clever don't
               you?

     Holmes feigns innocence.

                                WATSON

     The Palm Reader looks at Holmes.

                             HOLMES
                    (to Watson)
               Do you have any changes?

     Watson shakes his head as he pays the woman.

                             WATSON
               This is a new low -- even for you.

               It's the most honest prediction
               old Flora has made in years. And
               you know it yourself, Watson.
               That is precisely the reason you
               can't find a suitable ring.
               You're terrified of a life without
               the thrill of the macabre, as well
               you should be.

     Holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the
     wrapping aside, pleased with himself.

                             WATSON
               Do you still have my cut from the
               fight?

     Holmes digs into a pocket, produces a wad of coins.

                                HOLMES
               Why, do you --

     Watson snatches the money, storms into Madison and Haig.

     Holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window:
     "Large selection of engagement rings for every wallet."

     Holmes starts to look a bit nervous. As he follows
     Watson, he is intercepted by the Palm Reader who grabs
     his arm.

                             PALM READER
               I seen something in his hand.

               peril. Warn your friend, he's not
               safe.

     Even Holmes is taken aback by this.

     EXT. LONDON EAST END - MINUTES LATER
     Holmes and Watson move down the street, the pawnshop
     behind them. Now Watson is smiling, and Holmes is not.
     Watson is beaming at: an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box.

                                WATSON
               Not bad, eh?

     Holmes turns away, looks down at the TICKET he got from
     the pawnshop: an ADDRESS.

                             HOLMES

     windows are boarded up.

                             HOLMES
               Looks promising. And possibly
               dangerous. Oh, well, give my

     Holmes winds his way up a twisting flight of creaky
     stairs, finds a door with scratches on the keyhole.

     Holmes takes out his knife and goes to work on the lock.
     It is fiddly. It takes him a while. He kneels to get a
     better angle with the knife.

     CRACK! Watson's boot flashes past him as he KICKS the
     door off its hinges. Off Holmes' pleased reaction, he
     gestures them inside.

                             WATSON
               I can spare ten minutes.

     INT. REORDON'S ROOMS - DAY
     The squalid doorway opens into a series of dark rooms.
     Watson lights a lamp which reveals details of an interior
     that stops them both in their tracks:

     From floor to ceiling, every available inch is covered in
     writing, biblical Latin and Hebrew. Scrawled-on paper
     and pages are tacked to walls and carved into the
     plaster, crucifixes punctuate the yards of text and
     collage, strange pagan charms hang from the ceiling.

                             HOLMES
               He clearly felt something was
               coming to get him.

                                WATSON
               Something did.

     They move further inside where there is a hallway and a
     basic bedroom. Holmes inspects it, moves through a door.

               Watson, come take a look at this --

     Watson puts down what he was looking at, goes towards...


56   INT. REORDON'S LAB                                            56

     Instantly, Watson covers his nose with a handkerchief.

                              WATSON
                    (reeling)
               Bloody hell...

     The room is stacked with an alarming amount of scientific
     and biological paraphernalia. Some of it gives off a
     distinctly electrical hum. Ungodly fragments of limbs
     and matter float in jars.

                             HOLMES
                    (inhaling deeply,
                     loving it)
               Ammonium sulfate.

     In the center of the room, something ROTTING. An
     experiment generating a massive stench, a seething cloud
     of flies. Holmes and Watson step closer to see:

     DEAD FROGS. Eyes opened impossibly wide, their bodies
     frozen in strange contortions, as if mid-death-rattle.

     Holmes moves around the room, sniffing like a morbid
     perfumer. Watson does his best not to gag.

                             HOLMES
                    (mumbles)
               Phosphorous... Formaldehyde...

               Appears he was attempting to
               follow occult formula with
               scientific practice.

     Watson moves to the stove, sees a sheaf of BURNT PAPERS.
     He digs through them, finds one piece not as burnt as the
     rest. A CREST stamped on it, impossible to read.

     Watson digs through his forensic bag, pulls out vials.

                             WATSON
               Has he any hydrochloric acid?

     Holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to Watson.
     Watson catches it, starts pouring the acid, another
     chemical on a clean sheet of paper.

     Holmes senses something, moves into the next room.       He
     stops at an open window, smells the CURTAINS:

                              HOLMES
                Irene was here.

     Watson presses the chemical-soaked paper onto the burnt
     paper.

                              WATSON
                Why would she hire you to find
                him, if she planned to do the job
                herself?

                              HOLMES
                Maybe it's not the man she's
                after, but something else.
                Something he was working on?
                              WATSON
                Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron
                right out of the ink. Long as
                it's not too burnt...

     Watson keeps rubbing the paper together, puts it by the
     lantern. Slowly, faint words APPEAR on the blank page.
     Ghostly chemistry. Watson sees the crest is Blackwood's.

                              WATSON
                He worked for Blackwood.

     Holmes gets a whiff of something, raises an eyebrow.       He
     starts walking back to the other room.

                              HOLMES
                There's one odor I can't put my
                finger on. Sweet, almost like
                perfume... or sugar....
                     (stops, sniffs)
                Barley sugar.

     They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of
     seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly
     deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a
     twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy).

     They stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson.    Holmes'
     eyes widen at the giant.

                             HOLMES
               Hello, gentlemen.

     Dredger is deadpan.

                             DREDGER
               Sherlock Holmes.

                             HOLMES
               Let me guess -- you're here to
               extinguish any connection between
               the man who lived here and the man
               you work for? Curious you'd still
               be running errands for a dead man.

                             DREDGER
                    (smiles)
               You do like to talk.

     The two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson.

                             HOLMES
               You take them, I'll handle Mr.
               Sweet tooth.

                             WATSON
               Seems about fair.

     Watson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging
     at them. As they dodge and swing back --

     Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as
     a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a
     dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a
     CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye:

     He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the
     heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it
     so the curtain-rings rain to the floor.

     He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's
     face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly --

     Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his
     arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air,
     sending him flying into --

      Holmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the
      bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his
      senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as --

      Watson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler.    Head
      butting one, kicking the other in the groin.

      The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades
      flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices
      his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so --

      The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs
      accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground.

      As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man
      HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade,
      which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson
      fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring.

      Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for
      some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a
      SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon.

      Dredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft
      desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS.

      ZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an
      ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet --

      ring off the floor, just as --

      Dredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson,
      knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away.

      Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by
      the efficacy of the weapon.

      Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.    Holmes
      cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums.

      Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on
      the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other
      end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!!

      The electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS
      Dredger back twenty more feet.

        Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts
        running for it, frantic as --

        Dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks
        at the sparking rod and races for the window as well.

        Watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as
        he's about to grab it...

        THUD!   Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING.

        Dredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the
        window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as --

        Holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window.   Watson
        picks up the ring, sees:

        The stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the
        floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson
        darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out --

        shipbuilders. Watson brings up the rear, as --

        Dredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the
        UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far
        from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed
        to see it smoothly into water.

        For now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the
        whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back
        around the shed that they just ran through.

        Holmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this
        network of struts. They weave through the shadows.

        Holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly.    He
        takes an angle to cut off Dredger, and --
                                                        (CONTINUED)

      ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger's path, hitting him with
      the lightning-rod, knocking him back. ZAP!! Holmes
      gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to LOSE POWER.

      Dredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches
      out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile.
      A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger:

      The shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the
      rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as --

      Dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at
      Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing
      others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward.


64    EXT. FABRICATION SHED - DAY                                  64

      Watson runs round the end of the building and sees Holmes
      scrambling under the half-built hull. Dredger in
      pursuit.

64A                                                               64A
      EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - SLIPWAY
      A police WHISTLE echoes through the air.   Dredger turns
      for a moment, just long enough for --

      Holmes to launch himself at Dredger. They tumble down
      onto the massive runners on the floor of the slipway.

      Holmes wrestles Dredger's head onto the runner and pins
      him down. Dredger kicks out viciously, splintering
      another chock. It's the last straw for the support
      mechanism, the whole thing starts to creak.

64B   EXT. FABRICATION SHED                                       64B

      From his vantage point, Watson can see what's coming.

                              WATSON
                Holmes!


65    EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      65

      Grappling frantically on the runners, both Holmes and
      Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the ship
      EXPLODE BACKWARDS --

      -- the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding
      down towards them.

                                                      52.


66    EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       66

      Dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers --

      -- Holmes charges into Dredger again, pulling him
      backwards across the runners. Dredger pulls Holmes down
      with him, Holmes' head hits the ground hard.

      Holmes lies semi-conscious, eyes rolled back into his
      head, as the leviathan roars down towards him.

      The ground beneath him shakes, knocks his head against
      the runner -- once, twice -- as he blinks back into
      consciousness, he sees the great shadow sweeping over
      him. He's doomed. And...

      The stern lurches to a STOP INCHES from his face. He
      opens one tentative eye, half expecting to find himself
      in the after-life, and sees black metal an inch from his
      nose. He realizes the ship has stopped, but he doesn't
      know why. He tries to roll out of the way, as --

66A                                                                66A
      EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
      We see the chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the
      half-launched ship.

      The SHIP squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle
      and crack with the weight of the tethered ship.

      A beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and...

      The timber finally gives way.   The ship is free again,
      falling through the air --
      Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the
      air above his head -- the hull screams past him with a
      sound like the side of the world being torn off --

      -- and then the ship's away, parting the Thames with a
      vast, frothy explosion of water.

      Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the
      river -- from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds.
      A quiet beat.

      Holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing
      into his lungs. He tries to pull himself to his feet,
      but Dredger's bone-shaking punches have taken it out of
      him and he sags back to the ground.

      Watson arrives, helps him to his feet. They stagger back
      to the slipway where Dredger was standing. And they
      find:

      Nothing.   No blood or trace.   The big man is gone.

      The police whistles get louder, officers swarm the scene.
      They see the wreckage, the ship adrift, and... Holmes and
      Watson.

      Watson looks at his watch and does a slow, deep burn.


67    INT. LONDON JAIL - MORNING                                    67

      The next morning. A giant holding cell where every shade
      and aspect of Victorian villainy is corralled.

      Holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's
      sleep. Watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot
      eyes. He's reading his notebook, making the odd change
      here and there.

      Holmes looks up and sees Watson staring at him, shaking
      his head.

                               WATSON
                 I haven't slept all night. I
                 deserve this... I clearly deserve
                 it. How could I ever be so
                 deluded as to believe I could meet
                 Mary's parents for tea once I let
                 myself be talked into going with
                 you. Now of course I'm in jail.

      Holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him
      enough pain that he decides to bind them with Irene's
      handkerchief.

                               HOLMES
                      (theatrically
                       indignant)
                 You're not implying that I am
                 responsible for our current
                 situation are you, Watson? We
                 were set upon, man, it was self-
                 defense.

      Watson shakes the notebook in Holmes' face.

                               WATSON
                 I've used the time to review my
                 notes on our exploits of the last
                 seven months... and I've come to
                 the conclusion that I must be
                 suffering from to some profound
                 psychological aberration.

               Why else would I continually allow
               myself to be led into situations
               where you're deliberately
               withholding your intentions from
               me?

                             HOLMES
               You've never complained about my
               methods before.

                             WATSON
               I'm not complaining... I never
               complain... I never complain about
               your violin playing at three in
               the morning, your mess, your lack
               of hygiene, your stealing my
               clothes, your setting our home on
               fire!

                             HOLMES
               That was an accident...

     Watson challenges him with a look.

                             HOLMES
               The first time WAS an accident...

                             BIG MAN (O.S.)
               Remember me, boys? Put me away
               for robbery a few years back?

     Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous-
     looking man who has a few conspicuous WARTS on his face.

                             HOLMES
               Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth
               most dangerous man in London.

     Watson snaps at the man.

                             WATSON
               Who could forget that face? I
               told you, a little nitrate of
               silver and the warts will be gone
               in two weeks. Now, if you'll
               excuse us!

     Brownlee takes a swing at Watson. Holmes checks him and
     drops Brownlee without missing a beat.

               patients and perform outlandish
               experiments on my dog.

                             HOLMES
               Gladstone's my dog as well.   It's
               in the interest of science.

                             WATSON
               What I do take issue with is your
               ruthless campaign to sabotage my
               relationship with Mary.

                             HOLMES
               Watson, I completely understand
               now. You're overtired and feeling
               a bit sensitive.

     Watson now turns away, completely irritated at Holmes'
     lack of understanding.

                             HOLMES
               What you need is a rest. You and
               I could go out to the countryside.
               My brother Mycroft has a small
               estate near Chichester. It has
               marvelous grounds and a beautiful
               folly. We could throw a lamb on
               the spit.

     Watson shakes his head in disbelief.

                             WATSON
               If I were going to the country, I
               would be going with my future
               wife --

                             HOLMES
               Certainly. We should have her
               along. Let's get Gladstone out of
               the house as well.

                             WATSON
               No, Holmes. Not you.   Me and her.
               You're not --

                             HOLMES
               Invited? Now you're not making
               any sense, Watson. Why would I
               not be invited to my own brother's
               country home?

               John Watson?   You made bail.

     Watson steps up. Holmes looks confused.    He steps
     forward. But the Guard shakes his head.

                              PRISON GUARD
               Just Watson.

     As he slides open the bars, they see... MARY emerges from
     behind the Guard. Watson stands for a beat between
     Holmes and Mary. He must make a decision. And he does --

     -- he leaves.

     Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary.
     She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson.
     The bars slide shut.

     The mob surrounds Holmes.   He's never looked more alone.

     The hood is pulled off. Holmes takes in the scene, eyes
     flicking around the room.

     He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR
     THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers.

                              SIR THOMAS
                Mr. Holmes, apologies for
                summoning you like this. I'm sure
                it's quite a mystery as to where
                you are, and who I am.

                              HOLMES
                As to where I am -- I was,
                admittedly, lost for a moment
                between Charing Cross and Holborn.
                But I was saved by the bread shop
                on Saffron Hill, the only bakers
                to use a certain French glaze on
                their loaves. After that, the
                carriage forked left, then right,
                a bump over the Fleet conduit --
                need I go on?

     Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head.

                              HOLMES
                As to who you are -- that took
                every ounce of my not-
                inconsiderable experience and
                skill... the letters on your desk
                are addressed to Sir Thomas
                Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice.
                That would be your official title.
                Who you realy are is another
                matter entirely.

     Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is
     on a roll.

               Judging by the sacred Ox on your
               ring, you're also the secret head
               of the Temple of the Four Orders --
               in whose headquarters we now
               stand, on the northwest corner of
               St. James Square.
                    (beat)
               And as to the mystery -- the
               mystery is why you bothered to
               blindfold me in the first place.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Yes, well, it's standard
               procedure, I suppose.

     Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement
     on their part.

                             STANDISH (O.S.)
               I think we have the right man.

     Holmes turns to see JOHN STANDISH and LORD COWARD
     standing behind him. Standish is an American in his
     sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s.

               Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador
               Standish from America and Lord
               Coward, the Home Secretary.

     Holmes acknowledges them -- barely -- as they enter.    He
     isn't impressed by rank.

                             LORD COWARD
               I suppose you already have some
               notion as to the -- practices of
               our Order?

                              HOLMES
               Yes.   They're almost interesting.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Be as skeptical as you like -- but
               our secret systems have steered
               the world towards the greater good
               for centuries. The danger is that
               they can also be exploited for
               more nefarious purposes.

                             LORD COWARD
               What some call the dark arts, or
               practical magic.

     Holmes looks around the room, sees FLAGS on the walls
     with ancient symbols, variations of the SPHINX.

                             STANDISH
               We know you're are a rationalist.
               We don't ask you to share our
               faith, only our fears.

                             HOLMES
               Fear is the more infectious
               condition.
                    (at Sir Thomas)
               In this case, fear of your own
               child.

     That shocks them rigid.

                             HOLMES
               Blackwood is your son, yes? You
               have the same colored irises -- a
               rare dark green, with diamond-
               shaped hazel flecks --

                      Thomas' ear)
               -- plus identical outer ears, or
               pinna, which only pass down
               through the direct bloodline,
               which would make you either
               brothers, or, more likely, father
               and son.

     Stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of
     conclusion. They turn back to Holmes. Sir Thomas seems
     especially shaken.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Very few people are privy to that
               information, and we want to keep
               it that way.

     Sir Thomas opens a bureau, digs for something.

                             SIR THOMAS
               He was conceived during one of our
               rituals. His mother wasn't my
               wife, but she shared our beliefs.
               She was a powerful practitioner.
               Though not enough to survive
               giving birth to him.

     Holmes is appalled and shows it.

                             SIR THOMAS
               We were young. It was before we
               fully understood the powers we
               were dealing with.

                             HOLMES
               Evidently.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Death followed him wherever he
               went, from his birth to arms he
               made and sold. What family he had
               tended to... not survive. No one
               could prove anything of course,
               but we all knew --

     Sir Thomas hands Holmes a TINTYPE. A photograph from the
     1860s. It's chilling: a death scene, a BODY covered by
     a sheet. A man who's just fallen out a window. A TEN-
     YEAR-OLD BOY -- young Lord Blackwood -- looks on.

                             SIR THOMAS
               The boy was a curse. I didn't
               have the courage either to take
               him in or to --

               All this is history. The present
               and future are worse.

                             SIR THOMAS
               We've done our best to stop him
               ourselves, but it's not enough.

                             LORD COWARD
               His power grows daily and
               exponentially. His resurrection
               is evidence of that. What he does
               next will be far more dangerous --

                             SIR THOMAS
               -- he's going to raise a force
               that will alter the very course of
               our world. We need you to find
               him and stop him before he does.

                             LORD COWARD
               We'll give you any assistance we
               can. As Home Secretary, I have
               considerable influence over the
               police.
                    (beat)
               Name your price.

     Holmes looks at Coward with scathing disdain.

                             HOLMES
               One of the great benefits of my
               work is that I can pick and choose
               my clients. I'll get him, but not
               for you.

     Holmes stalks out -- stops at the door, turns, fixes Sir
     Thomas with a very bleak gaze.

                             HOLMES
               I have one last question, Sir
               Thomas.

                             SIR THOMAS
               What is it?

     Holmes holds up the tintype.

                             HOLMES
               If the rest of his family's dead,
               why are you still alive?

     Holmes tosses the tintype onto a table, leaves.

74   EXT. THE GRAND HOTEL                                        74

     Holmes comes out of a carriage, and scoots up the steps
     of the massive hotel that's bustling with people.


75   INT. IRENE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY                               75

     Irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress. She
     pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at
     a mirrored dressing table. There's a decanter on the
     table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of
     wine.

     Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of
     WEAPONS hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from
     her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she
     puts down next to the wine glass). She pulls long thin
     needles from her hair, lets her hair down. As she
     continues...

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Holmes watching her from a shadowy
     corner. He looks on silently until:

                             IRENE
               If you're going to watch me take
               my clothes off, Sherlock, the
               least you can do is help me with
               the buttons.

     OR ALT:

                             IRENE
               To watch a lady undress without
               her permission is a criminal
               offense, Sherlock, and could get
               you into a lot of trouble...

     They both eye the Derringer on the table.

                             IRENE
               So why don't you come over here
               and help me instead.

     Holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches
     for the top button on the back of her dress.

                                IRENE
               That's better.

                             HOLMES
               You can stop looking for Reardon.

                             IRENE
               I knew I could count on you.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                             HOLMES
               He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.

     Irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers.

                             IRENE
               Wonderful. Case closed then.
               Your services are no longer
               required.

     Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene.

                             HOLMES
               I can't help wondering if your
               employer will be as content with
               these results? You were
               uncharacteristically ill at ease
               in his presence. Your hand was
               trembling, your gaze was averted.
               I couldn't see his face, but I
               spotted chalk on his lapel. A
               professor perhaps?

     Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN.

                             IRENE
                    (behind screen)
               The eye patch was a nice touch.

                             HOLMES
               But I've never known a professor
               to carry a gun, and on such a
               clever contraption.

                             IRENE (O.S.)
               Let's not argue.

                             HOLMES
               We're not.

     Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian
     undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND
     still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing
     table.

     Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on.

                             HOLMES
               Tell me who you're working for and
               what he's after.

                             IRENE
               That's nobody's business but my
               own.

                             HOLMES
               I disagree.

                             IRENE
               You see, we are arguing.

     Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his
     case vehemently.

                             HOLMES
               When a man you ask me to find ends
               up dead in the coffin of the most
               notorious murderer since Jack the
               Ripper and that murderer manages
               to return from the dead, not only
               is it my business, it's the
               business of Scotland Yard and the
               highest levels of the British
               government. They will certainly
               consider your reticence to be an
               obstruction of justice. Which in
               relation to a crime of this
               magnitude would certainly mean
               prison time.

                             IRENE
               This wine is excellent.    You
               should really try some.

     Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the
     wine bottle.

                             HOLMES
               So what's it to be?

                             IRENE
               Do we really have to decide now?

     Irene reaches for the wine.

                             HOLMES
               You're in over your head this
               time, Irene.

     Irene snatches up her gun.    Holmes grabs her arm.

     BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe.
     Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses
     him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else.
     Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that
     disarms Holmes.

     The kiss leads them to the bed.

               That's better.

     Irene pulls him down to it.     He doesn't resist.

     CLICK!

     Holmes' eyes flare with surprise.

     CLICK!

                                IRENE
               Much better.

     Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame.

                             IRENE
               This is the only way it could ever
               work between us, Sherlock -- one
               in shackles, the other with the
               key.

     She gets off him.

     While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually
     across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING.
     She's in charge now.

                             IRENE
               I've NEVER been in over my head.

                             HOLMES
               How can you live like this --
               always a fugitive.

     She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him.

                             IRENE
               But free. And on my own terms.
               Just like you -- well, not you at
               this exact moment --

      She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the
      handcuff keys down there.

                              IRENE
                -- but generally speaking.

      Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his
      neck, moves to the doorway.

                              IRENE
                If anyone asks, please let them
                know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have
                time to check out.

                you'll have to explain for
                yourself.

      She picks up TWO SUITCASES waiting for her at the door
      (NEW PROP!) and, as she leaves:

      Sir Thomas enters the hall from outside, he looks tired.
      His butler, PERIGRINE, stands there waiting for him.

                              PERIGRINE
                Good evening, sir. Some figs and
                honey with a nice glass of port?
                I've prepared a tray.

                              SIR THOMAS
                No thank you, Perigrine, I'm going
                to bed.
                     (as he heads
                      upstairs)
                You won't let those figs go to
                waste, will you?

     Thomas smiles, goes up.   Perigrine heads for the kitchen,
     licking his lips.


77   INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                      77

     Sir Thomas sinks into his bath.   Relaxing.

     The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN, drip, drip, drip.

     The silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is
     magically turned on. Sir Thomas opens his eyes in panic,
     as he hears an eerie WHISPER O.S., like the rushing of
     wind.

     Sir Thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up.
     Can't. Not all the way.

                              BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
                Hello, Father...

      Thomas blinks and sees that BLACKWOOD now sits in the
      corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion.

      Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck
      as he fights paralysis. He slides back down, slowly.

                              BLACKWOOD
                You can't fight it. It comes from
                a power greater than yours. You
                can only surrender.

      The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps
      closer and takes the sacred RING from his rigid finger.

                              BLACKWOOD
                I've been imagining this moment
                for a long time...

      The water closes over his face. Sir Thomas stares up at
      Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely.

                              BLACKWOOD
                ... I must admit, it's better than
                I thought it would be.

      INT. THE GRAND HOTEL - CORRIDOR - DAY
      Carrying an armful of laundry, a MAID slips a pass-key
      into a lock and opens the door...

      ... to be confronted by the snoring form of Holmes, still
      handcuffed to the bed. Clothes in total disarray. Her
      shriek wakes him. He looks down at himself and reacts
      with shock, then grim recognition sets in.

                              HOLMES
                Don't take this the wrong way, but
                might I borrow your hand?

      Holmes sits beside a COP, and opposite CONSTABLE CLARK.

                              HOLMES
                Chambermaids were once such a
                liberal breed. Besides, she
                misinterpreted my intention

                 This is why I find this modern
                 religious fervor so troubling,
                 there is no latitude for
                 misunderstanding.

      He looks out the carriage window and sees signs of a
      spiritualist gathering.

                              HOLMES
                Faith runs riot over reason.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                Well, it's a good thing she was
                offended or we'd never have found
                you. The inspector's been over to
                Baker Street himself this morning.

      The coach stops.

78C   INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                    78C

      Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As
      Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                We've checked everything. No sign
                of a break-in. The Butler didn't
                hear anything. The body was in
                the tub, eyes wide open --
      -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                     (realizing Holmes
                      isn't there)
                -- only his ring was missing.

      He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right
      back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode.
      Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best
      -- this is, in fact, why he exists.

      Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues
      into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the
      tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).

      The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene
      violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.

                              HOLMES
                Why did you drain the water?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                Out of common decency.

                              HOLMES
                     (incensed)
                Crime is common, logic is rare.
                The decent thing to do is catch
                the killer, not provide comfort to
                the corpse.

      Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes
      swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to
      the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up,
      opens it, sniffs it.

                                HOLMES
                Hmm...

      Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.

                                HOLMES
                What is that?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                     (smelling)
                Uhhhh... jasmine?

                              HOLMES
                Superb. I suspect this comes from
                a larger cannister. It'll either
                be in the pantry, high up where
                it's warm and dry, or in a linen
                closet with a vent. And,
                Constable, you could check the
                ground under the rear windows for
                any footprints not your own.

      Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.

                              HOLMES
                Data, data, data! I cannot make
                bricks without clay!

      The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to
      work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's-
      eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill.
      Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.

      Holmes is happy.

      He glances around the room, sees the chair where
      Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself.

      His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He
      steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust.
      The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.

      Holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM
      POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing:

      He pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to
      reveal a SECRET ROOM. Holmes enters --

      Holmes finds a desk with a prayer table, and ancient
      texts, spellbooks, one book open to a picture of
      Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward --

      An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar,
      four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's
      BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.

      Holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of
      paper, just as --

      -- Const. Clark and the Officer return, the Officer
      proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE BATH SALTS.

      They are startled by the secret room --

      -- they are even more startled by the sight of Holmes
      kneeling at the altar and singing to himself.

      As soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and
      walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words.

      Holmes walks up the stairs and finds Watson's office door            
      open. He is well into packing his things. The office is

               My new roommate. He's an

               No, he's your friend from                               
               Reordon's. He didn't survive                            
               Dredger landing on him. Poor                            
               fellow. But there is some                               
               consolation in the knowledge that                       
               he can still be of service to his                       
               fellow men.                                             

     Watson keeps packing. Holmes analyzes the body,
     starting, of all places, with the outer elbows and
     forearms of his coat.

     Holmes grabs various instruments and other items from             
     Watson's newly-packed boxes. Frustrated, Watson snatches          
     them back as quickly as Holmes takes them out.

               Elbows and arms stained with
               blood, but older than his own
               injuries. Plenty of it, layer on
               layer...

     Holmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife,
     examines it.

                             HOLMES
               Though none of it human.

     Watson slows down slightly. He keeps packing, trying to
     resist the mystery, but it's not easy.

                             HOLMES
               A butcher perhaps...?   What else?

     Holmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies
     the color of the flame carefully. Watson wrinkles his
     nose at the smell.

                             HOLMES
               Hm -- predominantly yellow flame,
               but with distinct green bursts.
               Sulfurous. He spent lots of time
               around industrial work and very
               little around a wash basin.

     Holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under
     the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his
     fingers like a connoisseur.

                             HOLMES
               Coal... river silt...

     Watson slows down further, struggling.

                             HOLMES
               That plus the river silt and
               industrial slag on his trousers
               puts him squarely in...

     A hanging beat.   And Watson finally cracks, blurting out:

                              WATSON
               Nine Elms.

                             HOLMES
               Well done. Now, you didn't happen
               to pack the Lord's Register of
               members' interests, did you?

     Watson pulls it out of a box.

     As Watson flips through it, Holmes plucks a few chords on
     his violin, thinking. Watson finds the page.

               It's endless, he's had a hand in

                  lead us right to Blackwood.                                

        Holmes leaps up and readies himself to leave.

        This gives Holmes pause.                                             

                                HOLMES
                  Right. Well uh... best of luck                             
                  with everything, then.

                                   WATSON
                  Same to you.

        A brief nod, then Holmes is gone.

        A beat as Watson continues packing. He heaves a box up,
        moves for his suitcase. After a moment, he notices...

        Holmes' PISTOL.

                                   WATSON

        He picks it up. As he contemplates the weapon, he
        becomes more serious. Then angry. He mouths a curse to
        himself, and sees their DOG giving him a disapproving
        look.

                                WATSON
                  Yes, I know. Don't give me that
                  look, Gladstone.

        He pockets the gun, grabs his jacket and heads out.

      A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle down. He looks up, surprised
      by the rain. He raises his collar, and keeps moving.

      He hits the door to a building. It is locked. He bangs
      on the door, as the rain comes harder. The door finally
      opens. As he enters, we see the rain stops behind him,
      gone as fast as it came. A RAVEN flaps into the night.


82B   INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT             82B

      Standish comes up the stairs, wiping the raindrops off
      his coat, trying to dry himself, as he enters --


83    INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS - COUNCIL CHAMBER    83

      A five-sided room. A few dozen venerable-looking
      characters arrange themselves in seats. Lord Coward
      stands next to a central throne. He stays standing as
      they all sit -- all except STANDISH.

                              STANDISH
                What's the meaning of this?   Why
                did you call us here?

                              LORD COWARD
                Sir Thomas is dead. Effective
                immediately, I nominate Lord
                Blackwood as head of the Order.

                              STANDISH
                Are you mad, Coward? Have you any
                idea what he's capable of?

                              BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
                Of course he does. It's why he's
                here.

      Blackwood enters. He looks as if he's been to hell, and
      come back more powerful than ever.

      The crowd is stunned. Standish looks at Coward,
      betrayed, turns to the others -- who are transfixed by
      the sight of Blackwood suddenly kneeling before them.

                              BLACKWOOD

     Blackwood stands, prowls.

               You've made policy in secret for
               centuries. Now, you'll make it

               Across the Atlantic lies a colony
               that was once ours, and will be
               again. Their civil war weakened
               them; their government is as
               corrupt and ineffective as ours.

               The powers he's playing with are

               They're limitless -- even death

     Nobody moves.   Blackwood smiles -- he's won.

      Flames consuming him, Standish flails, crashing through a

      The fireball plummets through the sky, lighting city
      blocks. People look up, gape, and --

      WHOOMPF! Standish lands on the roof of a carriage.
      Horses and carriages SCREECH to a stop.

      The flames flicker blinding white, as his body contorts,
      melting away. People scream, gasp, faint, cross
      themselves, as they witness this unnatural act.

                Come, drink your allegiance here.

      The members line up to drink from a CHALICE. It doesn't

84    EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT         84

      An industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't
      stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into
      the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK
      FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water.

      Just above the thump of industry we can hear a
      distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a
      decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO
      VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man
      in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER.

                              HOLMES
                Everything all right, Captain
                Tanner?

      Captain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard.

                              TANNER
                Just a little leak, nothing to
                worry about.

      Watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very
      serious leak. He's soaked, and furious.

                              TANNER
                Not a great one for the water, are
                you, doctor? Army type, aren't
                you? You wouldn't have lasted
                long in the Navy.

      Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope.
      He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The
      engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers:

                              TANNER
                That's as far as we can go.

      Holmes starts clambering over the side.    Watson's pissed.

                              WATSON
                There must be fifty yards of mud
                out there.

      Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the
      prow. He whispers at Tanner.

               Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the
               police when you get there.

     Tanner nods. A soft "splosh" as Holmes disappears.
     Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind,
     watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner.

                             WATSON
               I know precisely how much money is
               in there.

                             TANNER
                    (taking the piss)
               I am sure you do, doctor.

     Watson glares, goes over the side, with his walking
     stick.

86   EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE                              86

     Holmes and Watson emerge out of the shallows, covered in
     mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does.

     They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the
     river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more
     THUGS are loading the boat with something.

     Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance,
     where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes'
     GUN.
                             HOLMES
               What are you doing with my gun?

                             WATSON
               Oh, please.

                             HOLMES
               It was an honest mistake --

                             WATSON
               There was nothing honest about it.

     Holmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing,
     the closest he'll come to a confession. Watson steps
     forward.

                             WATSON
               Come on, let's get this over with.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

     They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes
     whispers, trying to figure out the best strategy.

                             HOLMES
               The one on the left seems more
               attentive, might prove easily
               distracted. The big one's been
               drinking -- whether for courage or
               from habit... Watson?

     Watson has already left. He simply walks up to the door
     and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun --
     before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip.

     Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks.
     He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he
     follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him.
     He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --

87                                                                 87

88   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - TUNNEL                      88

     Holmes walks towards Watson who stands in the doorway,
     stopped in his tracks, spooked. Holmes catches up,
     passing Watson into --


89   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ANTECHAMBER                 89

     Shadows on shadows. Metal groans softly, like a
     plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse
     instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay
     dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move
     through it.

     As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs
     his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it.
     Quiet:

                             HOLMES
               They cleared something out of
               here, not minutes ago...

     Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects
     it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore.

                              WATSON (O.S.)
               Holmes.   You need to see this.

     Holmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of
     doors.

     Holmes pulls out a CIGAR-CUTTER, CLIPS off the rat's
     TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson,
     stepping into --


90   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - FACTORY FLOOR                90

     A massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly
     gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now.
     An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the
     killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I-
     beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the
     wind.

     On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118.

                               WATSON
               One-eighteen.    It's a date, a
               time?

     Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.

                             HOLMES
               It's chapter and verse.
               Revelation 1:18. `I am He that
               liveth, and was dead.'

     Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:

                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
               `And behold, I am alive
               forevermore, and have the keys of
               hell and of death. Amen.'

     Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in
     the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and
     Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in
     the flesh.
                              BLACKWOOD
                I cautioned you to accept that
                this is beyond your control. Now
                you see the truth for yourself.

     The hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely.
     Holmes tightens. Blackwood continues, his voice echoes,
     as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.

                             BLACKWOOD
               I want you to bear witness. At
               noon tomorrow, the world as you
               know it ends.

     Watson pulls his gun, draws a bead on Blackwood, pulls
     the trigger. Click. Misfire.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                       77.

                              BLACKWOOD
                And because I appreciate your
                help, Holmes, I have a gift for
                you.

      Holmes starts climbing up towards Blackwood.

                              BLACKWOOD
                     (voice moving away)
                She followed you. You led your
                little lamb straight to slaughter.

      Suddenly the whole machine starts up. Industrial-
      strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking
      towards the processing line. Blades and gears and
      grinders churn.

      Watson's eyes go from Blackwood to --

      A pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing
      area, towards the SCORCHER (which scorches the carcasses
      with live flame).

      Then next carcass emerges --

      -- not a carcass, Irene. She is alive, for now. She
      hangs from two hooks on a track-line, her wrists shackled
      above her, her mouth gagged.

      Her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense
      relief for a moment, then determination.

      Holmes looks up to see Blackwood's shadow retreating.

      Decision time.

90A                                                                90A
      INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ASSEMBLY LINE
      Holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to
      gear like stepping-stones. He heaves himself up to the
      conveyor, where Irene is being pulled down the assembly
      line towards the flames.

      Watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut-off switch.

      Holmes unties Irene's gag.

                              HOLMES
                It's your turn in shackles this
                time.

      Ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an
      overwhelming burst of flame. Holmes and Irene are next.

                But this time no key,
                unfortunately.

      Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate
      hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her.

      The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the
      next blast.

      Watson sees a LEVER (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) that looks
      promising, turns to head for it -- then his eyes focus on
      a big canvas splatter cloth.

                              HOLMES
                I've been meaning to ask you
                something --

                              IRENE
                Well, I'm a captive audience.

      Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes
      and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to
      Holmes --

      -- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the
      flames hit them.

      The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them.

      Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops
      away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just.

      Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit!" he
      looks ahead --

      -- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a
      long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER.

      Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try
      the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it
      all the way over --

      -- and the belt speeds up with a jerk.

      Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the
      original speed, looks around for another possible off
      switch.

      Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off
      the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's
      legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged
      into the boiling water.

      She's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes
      moving sideways, keeping pace with her.

                              IRENE
                     (trying her best not
                      to show the strain)
                You had a question.

      Holmes keeps hold of Irene's feet as he maneuvers past
      various obstacles --

                              HOLMES
                     (same)
                Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain
                you're not in over your head?

                              IRENE
                     (panting)
                In some countries steam is
                considered excellent therapy for
                the skin.

      -- then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt,
      jerks away, and Irene touches the water, SCREAMS.

      Watson hears the scream, turns -- then sees something
      again. It pisses him off. Fuck this machine.

      When Holmes has Irene stable again:

                              IRENE
                     (weakly)
                I have to say -- it's overrated.

      Holmes has to admire her courage -- until he hears Watson
      yelling at him.

      Up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank --
      and impassable obstacle from Holmes' side of the conveyor
      belt.

      Watson points at the I-beam running above them.   Holmes
      nods. Irene sees it, too.

      Holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the I-
      beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended
      upside down by her shackles and her feet --

      -- and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water.

      Watson appears opposite Holmes, nods up at Irene.   She
      swings off the I-beam, through the air --



                                                    (CONTINUED)

      -- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal,
      facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of
      boiling water.

      As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant-
      looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE,
      NEW PROP!)

      Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves
      her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch.

      Irene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the
      equipment, following her.

      Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes
      them.

      Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS
      HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt,
      catches up to Irene --

      -- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF
      LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW.

      Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the
      lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal
      kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled.

      Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH.
      Whew!

      Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and
      pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK!

      A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps
      moving towards the giant band saw.

      Shit a brick.

                              IRENE
                Sherlock?

      Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces
      himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his
      might --

      -- smashes the shackle lock.

      Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her
      right hand.

      The bandsaw whines viciously.

      Irene swings aside, just misses it.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

      Gets a free haircut.

      Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she
      can free her right hand (a move not possible with both
      shackles).

      Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with
      her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME.

      Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down --

      -- sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut-
      in-half pig carcasses. They're okay.

      Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door,
      looking for Blackwood.

      Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile --

                              IRENE
                Thank you so much. I owe you.

      -- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.    Holmes
      grabs her, stops her.

                              HOLMES
                You owe me information.
                     (angry)
                No more games, Irene.

      She hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks
      at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth:

                              IRENE
                Blackwood's manufactured large-
                scale weapons for years. Lately
                there've been rumors of something
                new. More powerful than anything
                else. And... magical. My job is
                to find out if the rumors are
                true.

                I would say they are.

      And she's off, running toward the door. Holmes trails
      her, processing. They blast through the doors to --


91    EXT. NINE ELMS JETTY                                            91

      Watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock.
      He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into
      the darkness.

      Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson.
      Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something
      on the planks:

      Steel drums are dripping.    A chemical.   Holmes recognizes
      it.

                                HOLMES
                Watson!

      Watson continues down the dock, tripping a wire connected
      to the steel drums, he turns realizing he has set off a
      trap and turns back to warn the others --

                                WATSON
                Holmes...

      A metallic conductor SPARKS.    Time slows.   BOOM!

      The drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding
      conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights
      up all of London.

                              HOLMES
                WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!!

      Holmes is pushed back   by the explosion as the rest of the
      barrels that line the   dock begin exploding arond them --
      it looks as it Watson   hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is
      knocked to the ground   by the blasts and flying debris.

      Holmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and
      debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally
      knocking him to the ground.

      He reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an
      exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover --
      BOOM! The barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them
      down, but to safety.

      As he opens his eyes --

     We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot
     Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has disappeared.
     Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but --

     -- is intercepted by Constable Clark.

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               There's an order for your arrest
               all the way from the top, sir --
               so you'll have to hit me now.

                             HOLMES
               From Lord Coward?

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               Yes, sir, so make it look good.

                             HOLMES
               Thank you, Clarky.

     Holmes cracks Constable Clark in the sweet spot, helps
     him gently to his knees. Holmes turns away, makes his
     escape fast.

     Holmes turns back to look at the explosion.

     INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR
     Two POLICEMEN half-heartedly guard the end of a corridor.
     One reads the paper. The headline: "AMERICAN AMBASSADOR
     STANDISH BURNED ALIVE!"

     Mary returns past them, having unsuccessfully washed away
     tear-stained makeup; there is a smear on her cheek. The
     two coppers nod respectfully.
     Mary arrives at the windowed door of a private room,
     reaches for the handle, pauses.

     THROUGH THE GLASS, she sees a white-coated DOCTOR,
     studying Watson's chart.

     Mary stays at the door, unsure whether to enter or not.

     shrapnel. He mumbles inaudibly, his eyes still closed.
     He's delirious, sweating.

     (NOTE: Mary's detective novels and magazines, coat,
     handbag, etc. already in the room.)

     The doctor injects Watson in the arm. The shot wakes
     him. Watson tries to sit up, wincing with pain.

                             WATSON
               What are you administering?

                            DOCTOR
               Morphia. A sixth of a grain, for
               the pain.

     Watson looks at his wounded shoulder.

                             DOCTOR
               There are four pieces of shrapnel.
               The surgeon should be along
               shortly.

     Watson tries to sit up again.

     This reveals that Mary has entered the room, stands back
     respectfully, letting the Doctor do his work.

                             WATSON
               Are they subcutaneous, or deeper?

                             DOCTOR
               They're near the carotid artery.

                             WATSON
               Get a mirror, I'll extract them
               myself.

                             DOCTOR
               I can't authorize that, Doctor.
               We must first manage the pain and
               combat the infection.

                             WATSON
               I haven't time for that.   My
               friend is in dire --

                             DOCTOR
               Your friend? What kind of friend
               takes a retired soldier, who's
               served his country and deserves a
               peaceful, private life, and puts
               him so directly in harm's --

     Watson grabs the Doctor's arm angrily.

               misadventures.


     ON MARY

     As she takes a closer, sharper look at the Doctor.

                             WATSON
                    (succumbing to the
                     morphine)
               It was worth a wound, worth many
               wounds...

     Mary steps towards the Doctor, eyes flashing.

                                MARY
               Excuse me --

                             DOCTOR

               Do you really?     Doctor.

     The Doctor turns just outside the door, to face her.
     She's suddenly very angry.

                             MARY
               You have nothing more to say to
               me?

                             DOCTOR
               Um... I'll check in on him again
               shortly.

                             MARY
               Is that the best you can do? I'm
               disappointed, but not surprised.

     The Doctor has no words.

                             MARY
               If anything happens to him, both
               our lives are lost. Do you
               understand that? Can you? --

     fast.

       ESTABLISHING SHOT of London, possibly the bustle of Fleet
       Street during the morning rush hour. A train crosses on
       an overhead railway.

       We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a
       splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the
       hospital is slumped down against the wall.

       We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the
       Doctor is actually Holmes.

       There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't
       completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down,
       obscuring him --

       -- but not obscuring the light of instability in his
       eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes
       them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

95     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   95

       Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling.

       He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's
       death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,
       hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.

       Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the
       bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the
       floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12
       o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).
       The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's
       fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).

       Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle
       around each image and a circle directly in the center of
       the four other circles. He then draws lines which join
       the circles together in the shape of a cross.

       In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from
       a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around
       that circle.

       He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)
       then stands in the center of the circle.

       He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,
       cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto
       the ground just outside the circle.

     Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily
     reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting.

     Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in
     mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around
     Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that.

                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
               And now it dawns on you, you begin
               to recognize your part in his
               play.

     Holmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him
     within the outer circle of flame.

                             BLACKWOOD
               You see the path he chose for you.

     Holmes sways, fuzzy.   He struggles to focus on Blackwood.

                 needed five lives for my
                 resurrection. Why would I take a
                 sixth under St. Paul's?

     Holmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight.

                               BLACKWOOD
                 Unless I simply wanted to be
                 caught by the great Sherlock
                 Holmes...

     Blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at
     Holmes' head.

                               BLACKWOOD
                 ... so I could die on the biggest
                 stage of all. You made me what I

     We see --

     The sun is rising.   Holmes' eyes open and we see:

     WATSON -- or some deathly version of his old friend -- is
     sitting in the chair where Blackwood appeared.

                              HOLMES
                     (confused)
                Watson...?

     Watson leans closer, into the light. A ghost or a man?
     He gestures towards the diagram on the floor.

                              WATSON
                Interesting artwork.   You look
                bloody awful.

     He writes something in his notebook. He is decidedly
     alive, but with burn flashes, cuts and bruises. His arm
     is in a sling. He's been through it.

     In the b.g. Irene is at the fire heating some coffee.

                              HOLMES
                What about the shrapnel in your
                arm?

     Watson shows him a piece of shrapnel --

                              WATSON
                Took it out myself. Mary said I
                had a lousy doctor.

     -- then tosses it away.

     They both smile.   United in agony.

                              HOLMES
                     (quietly, between
                      them)
                She brought you here?

                              WATSON
                Yes, oddly, it seems she might
                understand the power of
                partnership.

     They both look back over to Irene who just finished
     loading her gun. The coffee seems ready so she pours a
     cup.

               The fair sex was always your
               department, Watson.

     Irene walks over and hands Holmes the cup.

                             HOLMES
               Thank you. You know, I dreamt
               that you were strangling me.

                             IRENE
               I was... I had to get you to pass
               out to settle down.

     They smile at their unique, twisted understanding of one
     another.

                             HOLMES
               What time is it?

                             WATSON
               It's half past nine.

     Holmes takes a drink of coffee.

                             HOLMES
               Excellent brew, but I believe my
               head requires something a bit
               stronger to clear the --

                             WATSON
               I brought you this...

                             HOLMES
               Exactly.

     Watson and Irene sit at a table, the SCREECH of a fiddle
     now comes from upstairs.

     The fiddler's owner -- from the pub's band -- is busy
     getting drunk with the money he has acquired.

     Irene arrives with two pints, puts one down in front of
     him, sits opposite him with the other.

     Watson looks from Irene to the pint with open suspicion.
     Could it be poisoned? He wouldn't put it past her. But
     then he decides that's absurd. He takes a sip.

                             IRENE
               Oh, I poisoned that one.

                             WATSON
               With your own venom no doubt.

                             IRENE
               Better a snake than a lap dog.

                             WATSON
               There's a new field in the
               treatment of abnormal
               personalities -- it's called
               psychology. It appears you're
               what's considered a para-neurotic
               deviant with anti-social
               proclivities. Quite severe. And
               untreatable.

                             IRENE
               No, doctor, I'm simply a woman.

      as he plays the violin, but not with a bow. He plucks
      it, he strums it, he makes strange atonal sounds, as he
      STARES AT THE RITUAL PATTERN he's laid out on the floor.

      Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's
      observed over the course of the investigation.

      He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor.
      Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas'
      ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal.
      Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- OX
      ring.

      Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in
      flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an
      American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped
      cane. Next to the feather he writes America.

      Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash
      to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.

      Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion --
      he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big
      question mark. Where? Who?

      Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang
      as if willing the flashes to come.

      The music stops. Irene and Watson notice the silence.
      They swap a glance. A beat. And Holmes emerges.

                              HOLMES
                I need a map of London.

102   INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   102

      Holmes is excited, electric.

                              HOLMES
                Now that you're sitting
                comfortably, I shall begin. My
                initial approach was far too
                narrow. When Blackwood invited me
                to Pentonville prison, he
                suggested I widen my gaze and, at
                minimum, I have done just that.
                In fact, I may well have
                reconciled thousands of years of
                theological disparity. But that's
                for another time. Blackwood's
                method is based on a ritualistic
                mystical system that has been
                employed by The Temple of the Four
                Orders for centuries. To fully
                understand this system, to get
                inside it, I re-enacted the
                ceremony we interrupted in the
                crypt... with a few enhancements
                of my own.

                              WATSON
                At minimum.

      Watson and Irene shoot Holmes knowing looks.

                              HOLMES
                My journey took me somewhat
                further down the rabbit hole than
                I had intended.

                              IRENE
                Yes, your little white tail got
                rather dirty.

                              HOLMES
                But I have emerged enlightened...
                The fraternity who silently
                control the Empire, share the
                belief with the Kings, Pharoahs,
                and Emperors of old that the
                Sphinx was a door to another
                dimension, a gateway to
                immeasurable power --

      He tosses Watson the pages from Sir Thomas.

                              HOLMES
                It is made up of four parts: The
                Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man --
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                      90A.

      He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx,
      covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body,
      Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face.

                              HOLMES
                In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I
                found the bone of an ox, the tooth
                of a lion, the feather of an
                eagle, the hair of a man. Map!

      Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying
      now.

                              HOLMES
                Now, it is a widely held belief
                that within the architecture of
                the great cities are coded
                references to this system.

      He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a
      cross...

      Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map)
      draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight
      through the middle of the cross that he drew on the
      floor.

                              HOLMES
                Since he rose from the grave,
                Blackwood has killed three men.
                Each murder was committed at a
                location that has a direct
                connection with the Temple,
                therefore the System.
                     (beat)
                Reordon, the ginger midget,
                represents Man. We found his body
                here...

      He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It
      corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew
      that has the hair (6 o'clock).

                              HOLMES
                Then Sir Thomas, Master of the
                Temple, wore the ox ring... he
                died here...

      Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the
      river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has
      the ox bone (12 o'clock).

                Standish was Ambassador to
                America, where the Eagle has been
                the national emblem for over a
                hundred years -- and not by
                coincidence.

      Holmes points to the map.

                              HOLMES
                The headquarters of Temple of the
                Four Orders where he died is
                here...

      He points to corresponding points on the map and on the
      cross.

                              WATSON
                Man, Ox, Eagle...

      He connects the dots on the map.   They form three points
      of a cross.

                              WATSON
                And last on the list:    the Lion.
      Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene
      step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the
      map...

                              HOLMES
                Correspondingly, the map will tell
                us the location of Blackwood's
                final act. Right here.

      Their eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing.

      Irene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn -- the
      point at which the other four come together. They look
      to where it would correspond to on the map -- right in
      the middle of the river.

                              HOLMES
                It is the fifth element -- the

       Holmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to Watson.
       He quickly moves to a hatch in the floor. Flings it
       open.

                 Ladies first.

       Irene jumps down.   Watson is about to follow her down.

                               HOLMES
                 Follow these plans.

       Watson goes down. It looks as though Holmes is about to
       join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room.
       Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade.

       Holmes races down the hall toward the back door, but the
       door EXPLODES inward. Police fill the hall. Holmes
       looks back, where more police block his path. He simply
       raises his arms, and they drag him away.

103    INT. POLICE CARRIAGE - MID-MORNING (LATER)                   103

       Holmes sits battered, cuffed and bruised, though we can
       see from his face that his spirits are unaffected by his
       physical state. Tough-looking cops sit either side of
       him, Lestrade sits opposite, shaking his head -- he can't
       believe it's come to this. He looks at Holmes.

      The carriage pulls up. Crowds are gathering outside,
      hawkers and tourists, plenty of flags and enthusiasm.
      Holmes sees the hands of BIG BEN, climbing toward noon.


105   INT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT                                    105

      The place is a hive of activity, preparing for pomp and
      circumstance, at its ceremonial best.

      All of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure
      of Holmes, who is marched through a series of doors and
      checkpoints along the corridors of power by an angry-
      looking Lestrade. They come to a door. Lestrade knocks.


106   INT. PARLIAMENT - LORD COWARD'S CHAMBERS                     106

      The door is opened by Lord Coward, who's halfway through
      putting on his official robes, and caught off guard by
      the sight of Holmes cuffed (hands behind him) and flanked
      by Lestrade and men.

                                 LORD COWARD
                Lestrade?

                              LESTRADE
                Begging your pardon, m'lord, I
                know it's unorthodox, but Mr.
                Holmes has been making serious
                accusations about you and the
                order, sir.

      Lestrade pulls his lapel, revealing a temple of four
      orders pin.

                              HOLMES
                Oh, that solves the great mystery
                as to how you became inspector.

      Lestrade punches Holmes.

                              LORD COWARD
                I have five minutes before my next
                engagement, why don't you regale
                me with your stories of
                conspiracies. Thank you,
                Lestrade, if you could wait
                outside.

      Lestrade leaves and shuts the door.

                              HOLMES
                I'm curious, Coward, did you
                assist Blackwood in all the
                murders or just the one I
                prevented? Very distinctive those
                hand-made shoes of yours, but the
                price of quality is the unique
                imprint they leave.

      Coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room.
      Holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end.

                               HOLMES
                Nonetheless, I confess to being
                completely out-matched. I could
                deduce very little from my
                investigation.

      Coward turns away for a moment -- Holmes subtly kicks a
      log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room
      with smoke.

                              HOLMES
                Fortunately, there is nothing more
                stimulating than a case where
                everything goes against you. How
                many members of parliament do you
                intend to murder at noon today?
                     (beat)
                Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion
                is parliament, isn't it?

      Lord Coward slows, looks at Holmes in some astonishment.

                              LORD COWARD
                Very clever. But it's not murder,
                Mr. Holmes. It's mercy. We are
                giving the weak masses a strong
                shepherd. Don't you see it's for
                their own good?

      Smoke fills the room so that Holmes is concealed. Coward
      pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window. He
      opens it to try and clear the smoke.

                              HOLMES
                No, but I don't care much what you
                think. I simply wanted to know
                the location of Blackwood's final
                ceremony, and now you have given
                it to me.

                              LORD COWARD
                I have told you nothing.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                      94.

      A pair of handcuffs, slide across the floor to Coward's
      feet. He looks up and Holmes is nowhere to be found.
      Coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door.

                              HOLMES

                But your clothes say infinitely
                more than you ever hope. The mud

                A faint aroma of excrement, from
                where you have been standing.

      Coward, Blackwood, and the Temple members perform a
      ritual around a pentagram in the SEWERS. The big
      ceremonial sword is prominent.

                              LORD COWARD (V.O.)
                It's a shame you made an enemy out
                of Blackwood, Holmes, you would
                have made a valuable ally. The
                powers at our disposal are far
                greater than you can imagine.

                              HOLMES (V.O.)
                You and Blackwood laid the final
                touches to your ceremony in the
                sewers beneath parliament less

                Both Houses met today. The entire
                government will be present.

                               LORD COWARD
                How terrible is wisdom, Holmes,
                when it brings no profit to the
                wise.
                      (turning to Holmes)
                We take power at noon.

      REVEAL Holmes sitting in a chair behind Coward.

                              HOLMES
                Well there's no time to waste
                then, is there?

      Coward spins around and shoots at Holmes. He misses.
      Holmes runs towards the open window as Coward fires
      another shot.

      With a single bound, Holmes leaps out of the window
      Coward opened.

      Coward runs to the window and sees Holmes DIVING toward
      the river Thames, PLUMMETING down down down to --

      EXT. THAMES - OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT
      SPLASH! Holmes dives into the river handcuffed. He
      disappears for a moment then surfaces, looks about in the
      water. A moment of concern until we hear the familiar
      "chug" of a struggling engine.

      Holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the
      surface. He grabs it with his hands. And... it pulls
      him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner.

      Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the
      rope. Irene is also present.

      When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his
      cuffs using bolt cutters. Clearly the whole escape has
      been planned. Holmes is pulled up into the boat.

                              TANNER
                     (to Watson)
                I told you he'd be coming out the
                top window, soldier boy. No way
                he'd be coming over the terrace.

      Watson hands over the change from the engagement ring.
      Tanner takes it happily.

                              WATSON
                How was Lestrade?

                              HOLMES
                Performed his role perfectly.   A
                little too perfectly, come to
                think of it.

      Watson has the PAPER that Holmes gave him in the attic.

                              WATSON
                Well, your instructions were
                fairly precise... about everything
                except the window.

      Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself.

                              IRENE
                Where to, Sherlock?

      Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment.

                              HOLMES
                Port side, Captain Tanner, into
                the sewers.

      Tanner turns the boat.   Irene looks out, her eyes narrow.

                              HOLMES
                Watson, did you bring my clothes?

      Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL.
      Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets
      it. He's never going to like guns.

       Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is
       still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took
       from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot.

                                IRENE
                  Starting early, aren't we?

       He offers the flask to her.

                                HOLMES
                  Trust me, have a drink.

       She can see this is more than a social invitation, she
       takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson,
       Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands
       it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes
       his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers.

                                WATSON
                  What are we doing in the sewers?

                                HOLMES
                  Patience, Doctor. I am about to
                  show you...

       As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward
       Big Ben, the time moving toward noon.

       Tanner's boat, unlit, floats at the opening to the
       tunnel, on the edge of the darkness.

                                TANNER
                  Far as I can go.

       Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the
       sewer. Irene follows. (Watson has his SWORD STICK and a
       GUN, Holmes has changed into the clothes Watson brought
       for him.)

       They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working
       their way around corners and through junctions back under
       the Houses of Parliament.

      Holmes ducks around a corner, stops. Irene and Watson
      flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long
      tunnel to:

      The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the
      flashback ceremony with the sword. But now:

      Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the
      pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it,
      a futuristic device:

                              HOLMES
                Behold, Blackwood's magic.

      A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with
      electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered
      ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE.
      Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet:

                              HOLMES
                A chemical weapon. The first of
                its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.

                              WATSON
                You can tell that from here?

                               HOLMES
                No.   I can tell it from here.
      He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL.

                              HOLMES
                I snipped this off a rather
                recumbent rat at the
                slaughterhouse. Note the blue
                discoloration, the faint smell of
                bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs
                of cyanide.

      He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it.

                              HOLMES
                That shaft leads directly to
                Parliament. When activated, those
                electrodes on either side will
                send a charge converting the
                cyanide powder into a gas.

       channel, DOWN a bend, all the way through a GRATE TO --

       of Lords and senior Royals. As they start to take seats,

       Holmes checks his watch.

                               HOLMES
                 Seven minutes to twelve...

       They nod. Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the
       tunnel, faster and faster.

       Irene trails them closely.

       Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt.
       It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise.

       They draw their guns.
       They burst into the area, completely surprising the three
       thugs.

       Watson pistol-whips the nearest.    Holmes front-kicks the
       next.

       The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns
       before he has a chance to fight or flee.

                                  HOLMES
                 I wouldn't.

       He doesn't. Irene comes in behind them and heads
       straight for the device.

                               WATSON
                 I'll keep these under wraps.

                              HOLMES
                Take this.

      Holmes hands Watson his gun. Gun in each hand, Watson
      herds the three thugs away from the device.

                              WATSON
                Over there.

      Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two
      dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out). Watson
      turns so that he can watch the action at the device --

      -- which puts his back to another tunnel.

      Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife,
      looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE
      (where electric coils and circuits pulse).

                              IRENE
                I've never seen anything like it.

                              HOLMES
                There's never been anything like
                it. A totally wire-free weapon.
                He must have some kind of remote
                device sending a signal to the
                receiver. Really quite --

      She reaches out with her knife and... ZAP! Her blade
      hits a coil, sparks flashing. Electrocuted, she drops
      the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by
      humming, sparking coils.

      Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes --
      RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON --

      Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both
      hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson.

      Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed
      from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways,
      sending both guns spinning away --

      -- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer.

      Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth-
      rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper
      cup.

      Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and
      Irene.

      Irene shoots one point blank with her Derringer, Holmes
      crushes the other's larynx.

                              HOLMES
                     (to Irene)
                Keep at it.

      Holmes goes for Dredger.


113   INT. PARLIAMENT - DAY                                       113

      Lords and Royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the
      session to begin. Coward looks up, and points, very
      emphatically.

                                 LORD COWARD
                Look.

      All eyes rise to see: BLACKWOOD, up in the Lords'
      Gallery. The hall goes silent, staring at a ghost.
      Blackwood is calm, commanding.

      Voices rise; Blackwood's followers move to block the
      doors as --

      BONG! The first CHIME OF NOON from Big Ben.

114                                                               114
      INT. SEWERS - DAY
      The chime echoes. Dredger charges towards the device and
      Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him
      for a moment.

      It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect
      the device.

      Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to
      defuse it.

      BONG!

      The second chime resounds. Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts
      him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously
      strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard
      enough to dislodge some.

      Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't
      even bother to block anything. Holmes' kicks lose steam
      as he loses air.

      BONG!


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                      (without looking up)
                 Nine strokes left.

      Dredger grins --

      -- until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung
      with full force by Watson.

      Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding
      ears. Holmes heads back to Irene.

      Watson draws the sword from his sword stick.   Deadly
      enough, but not very big.

                               WATSON
                 You owe me for the ring.

      Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only
      until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial
      sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more
      uneven than usual.

      BONG!

      As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts
      all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay --

      -- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the
      cradle by two RODS. His eyes narrow, a plan forming.

                               HOLMES
                 Give me your gun. The bullets, I
                 need the bullets.

      BONG!   The clock is ticking down.

      Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into
      Holmes' hand. He chops open the bullet casings with his
      knife, pouring the gunpowder into --

      -- the bowl of his pipe.

      BONG!

      Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little
      sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep.

      Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword
      out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it
      out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and
      moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword
      from head to toe.

      Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword --

       -- which shatters against the floor.

       While Watson is down, Dredger punts him into the sewer
       with a splash, then turns back to the device.

       BONG!

       Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on
       the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a
       familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are
       banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked.
       Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of
       anyone going to open them.

       INT. SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
       Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of
       the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place.
       Shaped charge, Victorian-style.

                               HOLMES
                 We need a light, a match --

       Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle:   her
       KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve.

                                 IRENE
                 Got it...
       Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them
       both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the
       device --

       -- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then
       he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and
       pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice.

       That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for
       long enough because --

       BONG!

                                IRENE
                      (breath crushing out

       The batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears
       ratchet past each other. Bad news.

                               WATSON (O.S.)
                 Hey!

       Dredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his
       belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES'
       GUN.

       BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers
       strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's
       back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the
       through-and-through) --

       -- and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away,
       eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream.

       BONG!

                               IRENE
                 Two!

       Holmes and Irene stagger for the device.

       Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a
       tree.

       Watson is face-down on the stones, still.   The gun falls
       out of his limp hand.

       Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely
       avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade,
       and...

       ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade,
       redirecting the spark toward --

       Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!   The
       shaped charge shears the steel rods.

       Holmes and Irene reach for the cylinders.

       BONG!

                  That was something new for us.

                                   HOLMES
                  Yes... it was.

       She looks past Holmes.

                                   IRENE
                  Watson --

       Holmes whips around -- sees Watson, seemingly dead. He
       goes to him, drops to his knees next to Watson, feels for
       a pulse.

       With his face still pressed to the stones:

                               WATSON
                 I'm pretty sure I heard the last
                 chime.

       Holmes looks down at his friend, relieved.

                               HOLMES
                 Yes, we made it. Just.

       Watson rolls over, sits up.     He's done, had enough.

                               HOLMES
                 Come on, you've got to admit,
                 you're going to miss this.

                               WATSON
                 Which part? The stench of the
                 sewers or the broken bones?
                      (beat)
                 My ankle's done.

       Watson looks around.

                                  WATSON
                 Where's Irene?

       Holmes turns, looks. The cylinders are gone, and so is
       Irene. His face darkens. He misread her yet again.

                               WATSON
                 Holmes, I'm sorry...

       Holmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze
       of tunnels. He motions to the disabled device.

                               HOLMES
                 Make sure Lestrade keeps it
                 intact.

       Watson nods.   He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness,
       face grim.

118A                                                                118A
       INT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY
       Blackwood flashes downward through the ornate official
       understory of the Houses, heads for a staircase
       spiralling even further down.

                                                        106.


118B   INT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY                                   118B

       Irene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns,
       sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels
       and columns. She picks up speed.
                                                          CUT TO:

       ANGLE FROM THE SIDE

       Blackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees
       Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away.

       Then Holmes.

       Blackwood follows them.    Sees something on the ground
       ahead -- pauses.

       It's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous
       action with Dredger.

       Blackwood scoops it up.

118C                                                              118C
       INT. SINGLE SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
       Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower --

       -- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe
       angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn
       sideways to continue.

       The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.

       And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off
       jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.
       The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick
       at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic
       gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into
       the pipe, into the unknown.


118D   INT. PIPE - DAY                                            118D

       The pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment
       it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious
       breath the only point of reference.

       This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly
       claustrophobic as it gets.

       Then, almost imperceptibly, light.

       We can make out Irene's determined profile. Light
       increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement.

                                                          107.


118E   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118E

       The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be
       the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new.

       Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder
       heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.


118F   INT. PIPE - DAY                                             118F

       Holmes grimaces, enters the pipe, shimmies TOWARDS us.
       An even tighter fit for him.


118G   INT. CELLAR - ON THE LADDER - DAY                           118G

       Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other --
       reaches an iron grate, has to use all her strength to
       shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this
       is a grind.

118H                                                               118H
       INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY
       Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full
       of construction equipment, and sees, yes --

       -- more stairs, upward.   The only ready way out.

       Gritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the
       stairs --


118I   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118I
       -- just as Holmes pops out of the pipe, vaults onto the
       fixed ladder and swarms up it. Anger lends him energy.


118J   INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY                                  118J

       IN A SERIES OF TIME JUMPS MARKED BY INCREASING
       EXHAUSTION:

       Irene finally makes it to a floor in the building that is
       flooded with sky-bright daylight.

       She surges for light -- a brick-framed window -- and --

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

                                                         108.


118K   EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE -         118K
       DAY

       OF IRENE at the top of TOWER BRIDGE. She's climbed up
       the inside of the Tower. She's 250 feet above the
       Thames.

       We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to
       maximum knee-buckling exposure.

       PULL BACK and SWEEP INTO a massive, NEAR 360-DEGREE
       HELICOPTER SHOT that starts with Irene at the
       (unfinished) window --

       -- then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with
       scaffolding --

       -- then the glory of London, the center of the world,
       laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty --

       -- and returns to Irene as, recovered somewhat -- she
       darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the
       Thames.

119-119G OMITTED                                                 119-119G


119H   EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY                             119H

       Irene works her way through the construction debris on
       the bridge. She makes it to the end, no further to go.                

                                 SHERLOCK

       Sherlock appears behind her, winded.                                  

                                 SHERLOCK                                    
                   It's bad manners to leave without                         
                   at least saying `goodbye.'                                

       Irene turns.                                                          

                                 IRENE                                       
                   Goodbye!                                                  

       He start to move towards her.     She whips out her gun.              

                                 IRENE                                       
                   You of all people know I will pull

       They circle around each other.

                               IRENE                                      
                 I'd tell you I'm sorry, that I                           
                 wish things could be different but                       
                 you wouldn't believe me anyway.                          

                               HOLMES                                     
                 Why hurry off, give it a try.                            

       He moves in again.   She shoots him in the arm.                    

       And in that split second --                                        

       Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with              
       WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls,            
       Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks           
       her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the              
       bridge. But Irene doesn't pause:                                   

       She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out            
       Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and                
       KICKS DOWN and --                                                  

       IRENE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE.                                        

                               BLACKWOOD

       EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY
                                                                          
       A look between them and then it's on. Holmes grabs a
       short section of wooden batten out of the railing.
       Flimsy, no match for the sword --

       -- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in,
       slashes, chops six inches off the batten.

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 I planned to kill a handful of                           
                 senile old men to make this empire                       
                 strong... but now because of you                         
                 thousands are going to die.                              

       Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before,
       his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self
       defense third.

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 All I have to do is break this                           
                 cylinder. The wind will do the                           
                 rest. And you'll be the first.                           

       The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some           
       rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off             
       the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword             
       out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade              
       and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it.             

       Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from            
       Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it             
       around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They                
       continue to spar, now bound.                                       

       Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes           
       simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with            
       Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.                     

       Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood            
       knocked from Irene's hand earlier).                                

       Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The               
       bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his            
       head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a                 
       circle around him.                                                 

       Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to
       go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to             
       Blackwood.                                                         

       -- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls --

       -- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking
       Blackwood around his ankle.

       Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of
       the falling plank, pulled toward the edge.

       Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes.                   

       Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a
       painful halt. His fingers are white from strain. Holmes
       remains cool.

                               HOLMES

                 people off, like the prison

       Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the
       plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood
       strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer
       we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS.

       Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a
       second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind
       whips harder.

       Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting
       a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops,
       hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to
       topple.

       (NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a
       faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale
       that Holmes played earlier for his flies.)

                 You hated your father and the

                 against them.                                           

       IN B.G.: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue
       to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a
       rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings,
       strikes another crane...

                               BLACKWOOD
                 Cut me loose, Holmes!

       Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully
       looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and
       dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.

                               HOLMES
                 You better hope that it's nothing                       
                 more than superstition as you                           
                 performed all the rituals
                 perfectly.                                              

       Holmes looks around at the gathering storm.
                                                                         
       Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he
       releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at
       breakneck speed.

       Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on
       the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope.

       Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt.
       The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down,
       Blackwood is on his knees, cowed.

                  First, the world will see you for                        
                  what you are. Then you will                              
                  hang... properly this time.                              

       Blackwood looks up. CRACK! The crane dislodges a METAL              
       GIRDER, which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes
       through the floorboards --

       Blackwood smirks.

                  It's a long journey from here to                         
                  the rope.                                                

       CREAK.   Holmes looks up.    Blackwood looks up.                    

                                HOLMES                                     
                  We'll see about that shall we.                           

       BANG! The top of the crane crashes down. The wooden                 
       infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away.                     

       Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING
       CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to              
       snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther...
       and finally --

       SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around
       Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly.

       Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a
       common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet.

       Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see:
       the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy
       sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a
       cloud.

       His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things              
       that cannot be explained.
                                                                           
       Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees:

       IRENE is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. She                  
       appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is            
       coming out of her mouth. Holmes moves down to her. He               
       takes her hand.

       Her eyes pop open.                                                 

       Irene makes a quick move: she tries to CUFF him.   But             
       this time, Holmes is ready for it:                                 

       He reverses the move, cuffing her instead.   He takes a            
       seat next to her.                                                  

       They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking           
       out over the Thames.

       Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close,               
       near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the top of her                
       shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants). He
       snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and                  
       walks away. She smiles, calls out:

                  You'll miss me, Sherlock.

                  Sadly, yes.                                                

       Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword                   
       stick, keeps walking.

       At the end of the top of the stairs.    Holmes hands the              
       Cylinder to one of the policemen.

       Rain falls softly.

                                LESTRADE
                  It'll be a hell of a trick if
                  Blackwood comes back from this
                  one.

                                HOLMES
                  Thank you, Lestrade.

                                LESTRADE
                  Now you're going to be even more
                  arrogant and insufferable than
                  ever.

       Then Lestrade cracks a smile.

                                LESTRADE
                  You're welcome, detective.
                       (beat)
                  Is the woman up there?

                                HOLMES
                  She won't be by the time your boys
                  get there.

       Holmes keeps moving into the night. The storm curls
       around him, the rain falling hard. And he sees...

       A shadow is waiting for him. We recognize the figure of
       WATSON. Holmes can't help but smile. He joins Watson,
       no words spoken.

       Holmes holds out Watson's sword stick. Watson takes it.
       The two of them stand looking out down the Thames.

       MOVING DAY. Mary and Watson walk towards 221B. A DRIVER
       loads Watson's boxes into a CARRIAGE that waits in front
       of the apartment.

                                 WATSON
                 One moment.

       Watson takes a quick look in one of the boxes.

                               WATSON
                 Please make sure this one is put
                 on the desk in the front room.

                               MARY
                 What's in all those notebooks?

                               WATSON
                 Nothing really... Just a few
                 scribbles... cases we've worked on
                 over the years.

                               MARY
                 All your adventures... I'd love to
                 read them sometime.

       Watson laughs then pauses for a moment to consider this
       idea before they enter.

       As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear                  
       that Mary now wears IRENE'S DIAMOND on her finger.
       Holmes had it made into an engagement ring.
                               WATSON
                 I still can't believe he's given
                 us that ring.

                               MARY
                 Do you think he's finally come to
                 terms with you leaving?

                                 WATSON
                 Of course.    No question about it --

       Watson opens the door of Holmes' apartment revealing a
       horrific scene: Holmes is hanging from a rope, his back                
       to them. He looks dead.

       Watson and Mary step in but do nothing to help Holmes.

                 he's far too fond of himself.                          

       Watson pokes him.   Turns him around.

                 Good afternoon. I was trying to                        
                 deduce the manner in which                             
                 Blackwood survived his execution.

                 were. But it had a surprisingly                        
                 soporific effect and I was carried                     
                 off in the arms of Morpheus, like                      
                 a caterpillar in a cocoon.

                 The executioner attached it to a                       
                 harness, thus allowing the weight                      
                 to be distributed around the waist

                  So you're saying Moriarty was                            
                  after a part of the machine and                          
                  not the poison.

                  The wire-free invention was the                          
                  game all along. Imagine being                            
                  able to control any device simply

125   FLASHBACK - INT. SEWER JUNCTION                             125

      We FOLLOW POLICEMEN heading into the sewer tunnel.

      They spread out to seal the crime scene, where Holmes had
      dismantled Blackwood's device.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)
                We believe Sergeant Smith was the
                first officer there.

      SERGEANT SMITH sees a POLICEMAN leaning over the device.

                              SERGEANT
                Oi, what you doing?

      The policeman looks up, and a GUN slides into his hand by
      means of the same device we saw in the carriage scene
      with Irene. We don't see his face.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)
                Shot in the head.

      BANG!

126   INT. 221 BAKER ST. (PRESENT)                                    126

                              HOLMES
                Were there powder burns on his
                eyebrows?

      Clarky nods.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                He was shot at point-blank range.

      Holmes and Watson look at each other -- complete change
      of demeanor -- mind racing, looking concerned.

      The dog has regained its vital signs.

                              WATSON
                There's a brave boy... There,
                there, everything's going to be

                 Moriarty was after the machine not
                 the poison.

      Holmes nods.

                               HOLMES
                 Blackwood's wire-free invention
                 was the game all along. It is
                 undoubtedly the more dangerous and
                 the more valuable of the two...
                      (wistful)
                 Irene was just a diversion.

      Mary looks at Watson who is clearly trying to curb his
      enthusiasm and interest.

      A KNOCK.   The MAN from the stairs pokes his head in.

                               MAN

127   EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - DAY                                      127

      Mary and Gladstone wait for Watson in the carriage.

      Holmes and Watson stand in the doorway.    A stiff beat.
      Holmes extends an awkward hand.

                              HOLMES
                An honor working with you, Doctor.

      Watson shakes Holmes' hand, puts a hand on his arm.      A
      warm look, an understanding between the two men.

                              WATSON
                Take care of yourself, Holmes.

      Watson moves to the open door of the carriage but Mary
      stops him.

                              MARY
                Try not to be too late for dinner
                with my parents and... be careful.

      She waves to Holmes as the carriage pulls away.   Watson
      looks relieved and excited.

                              HOLMES
                Magnificent woman, Watson.
                Magnificent!

      They climb into Constable Clarke's black mariah which
      pulls away down Baker St. We PULL BACK FROM the carriage
      WIDE and UP like our opening on Baker Street -- perhaps
      the POV of the raven.

                                                        FADE OUT.

                         Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs)

                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might 
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
                         to the ground.)
 
               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
                         After him!
 
                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
                         Turn!
 
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
               quickly hides behind Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
                         to place you both under arrest and transport 
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               begins walking back to his cottage.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, 
                         you was really, really, really somethin' 
                         back here. Incredible!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
                         around and Donkey is right in front 
                         of him.) Whoa!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
                         you that you that you was great back 
                         here? Those guards! They thought they 
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, 
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
                         like babes in the woods. That really 
                         made me feel good to see that.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, 
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses 
                         us.
 
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
               loudly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
                         work, your breath certainly will get 
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely 
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned 
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the 
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking 
                         out of my butt that day.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Why are you following me?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's 
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
                         faith...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
                         have any friends.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
                         cruelly honest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
                         me. What am I?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
                         tall?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your 
                         torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that 
                         bother you?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Nope.

                                     SHREK
                         Really?

                                     DONKEY
                         Really, really.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
                         thing. I like that. I respect that, 
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
                         in place like that?
 
                                     SHREK
                         That would be my home.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
                         You know you are quite a decorator. 
                         It's amazing what you've done with such 
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
                         don't entertain much, do you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         I like my privacy.

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing 
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when 
                         you got somebody in your face. You've 
                         trying to give them a hint, and they 
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I stay with you, please?

                                     SHREK
                         (sarcastically) Of course!

                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
                         You don't know what it's like to be 
                         considered a freak. (pause while he 
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
                         But that's why we gotta stick together. 
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.

                                     DONKEY
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
                         a chair.) No! No!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?

                                     SHREK
                         (irritated) Outside!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
                         I don't know you, and you don't know 
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you 
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
                         no one here beside me...
 
               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
               noise. He stands up with a huff.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
                         stay outside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (from the window) I am outside.

               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
 
                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
                         farm, but what choice do we have?
 
                         
                                     BLIND MOUSE2
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
 
                         
                                     GORDO
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
                         and lands on his shoulder.)
 
                                     GORDO
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
                         ear)
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ow!

                                     GORDO
                         Blah! Awful stuff.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Is that you, Gordo?

                                     GORDO
                         How did you know?

                                     SHREK
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
                         from behind and he drops the mice.) 
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.
 
                         
                                     DWARF
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The 
                         bed's taken.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Huh?

               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
               him.
 
                                     BIG BAD WOLF
                         What?

               TIME LAPSE

               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
               him to the front door.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and 
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy 
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
                         no. No! No!
 
               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)
 
                         
               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
               tent.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right, get out of here. All of you, 
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
                         look at Donkey)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
                         them.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         We were forced to come here.

                                     SHREK
                         (flabbergasted) By who?

                                     LITTLE PIG
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
                         this Farquaad guy is?
 
               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.

                                     SHREK
                         Does anyone else know where to find 
                         him? Anyone at all?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Me! Me!

                                     SHREK
                         Anyone?

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
                         Me, me!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
                         Your welcome is officially worn out. 
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
                         right now and get you all off my land 
                         and back where you came from! (Pause. 
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
                         You! You're comin' with me.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, that's what I like to hear, 
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
                         adventure. I love it!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it 
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
                         on the road again.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What did I say about singing?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I whistle?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I hum it?

                                     SHREK
                         All right, hum it.

               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

               DULOC - KITCHEN

               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.
 
                         
               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
                         and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
                         as fast as you can. You can't catch 
                         me. I'm the gingerbread man.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         You are a monster.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
                         and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
                         poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
                         me! Where are the others?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
                         eye.)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
                         Now my patience has reached its end! 
                         Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
                         pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
                         buttons.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         All right then. Who's hiding them?
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
                         muffin man?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
                         on Drury Lane?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Well, she's married to the muffin man.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         She's married to the muffin man.

               The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         My lord! We found it.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
                         it in.
 
               More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
               They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
               Mirror.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         (in awe) Ohhhh...

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Magic mirror...

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks 
                         him up and dumps him into a trash can 
                         with a lid.) No!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
                         Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
                         of them all?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         Well, technically you're not a king.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a 
                         hand mirror and smashes it with his 
                         fist.) You were saying?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
                         But you can become one. All you have 
                         to do is marry a princess.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Go on.

                         (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back 
                         and relax, my lord, because it's time 
                         for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
                         And here they are! Bachelorette number 
                         one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
                         a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
                         and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
                         include cooking and cleaning for her 
                         two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
                         (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
                         number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
                         the land of fancy. Although she lives 
                         with seven other men, she's not easy. 
                         Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
                         find out what a live wire she is. Come 
                         on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
                         picture of Snow White) And last, but 
                         certainly not last, bachelorette number 
                         three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
                         castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
                         But don't let that cool you off. She's 
                         a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
                         and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
                         for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows 
                         picture of Princess Fiona) So will it 
                         be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
                         number two or bachelorette number three?

                         Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number 
                         three, my lord!

                         Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess 
                         Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
                         have to do is just find someone who 
                         can go...

                         But I probably should mention the little 
                         thing that happens at night.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll do it.

                         Yes, but after sunset...

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona 
                         my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
                         the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
                         your finest men. We're going to have 
                         a tournament. (smiles evilly)
 
               DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section

               Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
               lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But that's it. That's it right there. 
                         That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-huh. That's the place.

                                     SHREK
                         Do you think maybe he's compensating 
                         for something? (He laughs, but then 
                         groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
                         He continues walking through the parking 
                         lot.)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

                                     MAN
                         Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing 
                         a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
                         screams and begins running through the 
                         rows of rope to get to the front gate 
                         to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. 
                         Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
                         - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins 
                         walking straight through the rows. The 
                         attendant runs into a wall and falls 
                         down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
                         continue on into DuLoc.)
 
               DULOC

               They look around but all is quiet.

                                     SHREK
                         It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, look at this!

               Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
               marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
               open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
               to sing.
 
                                     WOODEN PEOPLE
                         Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
 
                         
               Here we have some rules

               Let us lay them down

               Don't make waves, stay in line

               And we'll get along fine

               DuLoc is perfect place

               Please keep off of the grass

               Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

               DuLoc is, DuLoc is

               DuLoc is perfect place.

               Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.

                                     DONKEY
                         Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready 
                         to run over and pull the lever again)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) 
                         No. No. No, no, no! No.
 
               They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Brave knights. You are the best and 
                         brightest in all the land. Today one 
                         of you shall prove himself...
 
               As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
               Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right. You're going the right way 
                         for a smacked bottom.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Sorry about that.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         That champion shall have the honor - 
                         - no, no - - the privilege to go forth 
                         and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
                         from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
                         for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
                         the first runner-up will take his place 
                         and so on and so forth. Some of you 
                         may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
                         to make. (cheers) Let the tournament 
                         begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is 
                         that? It's hideous!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (turns to look at Donkey and then back 
                         at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. 
                         It's just a donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
                         kills the ogre will be named champion! 
                         Have it him!
 
                                     MEN
                         Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps 
                         into a table where there are mugs of 
                         beer)
 
                                     CROWD
                         Go ahead! Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just 
                         settle this over a pint?
 
                                     CROWD
                         Kill the beast!

                                     SHREK
                         No? All right then. (drinks the beer) 
                         Come on!
 
               He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
               of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
               to say that Shrek kicks butt.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

               Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek 
               gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah!

               A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time 
               and sees him.
 
                                     WOMAN
                         The chair! Give him the chair!

               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men 
               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding 
               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you 
                         very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try 
                         the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
 
               The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on 
               Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Shall I give the order, sir?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         No, I have a better idea. People of 
                         DuLoc, I give you our champion!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Congratulations, ogre. You're won the 
                         honor of embarking on a great and noble 
                         quest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest 
                         to get my swamp back.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Your swamp?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those 
                         fairy tale creatures!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you 
                         a deal. Go on this quest for me, and 
                         I'll give you your swamp back.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Exactly the way it was?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         And the squatters?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         As good as gone.

                                     SHREK
                         What kind of quest?

               Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field 
               heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Let me get this straight. You're gonna 
                         go fight a dragon and rescue a princess 
                         just so Farquaad will give you back 
                         a swamp which you only don't have because 
                         he filled it full of freaks in the first 
                         place. Is that about right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, maybe there's a good reason 
                         donkeys shouldn't talk.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't get it. Why don't you just pull 
                         some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle 
                         him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds 
                         his bones to make your bread, the whole 
                         ogre trip.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have 
                         decapitated an entire village and put 
                         their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, 
                         cut open their spleen and drink their 
                         fluids. Does that sound good to you?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, no, not really, no.

                                     SHREK
                         For your information, there's a lot 
                         more to ogres than people think.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Example?

                                     SHREK
                         Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 
                         (he holds out his onion)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs the onion) They stink?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes - - No!

                                     DONKEY
                         They make you cry?

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     DONKEY
                         You leave them in the sun, they get 
                         all brown, start sproutin' little white 
                         hairs.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres 
                         have layers! Onions have layers. You 
                         get it? We both have layers. (he heaves 
                         a sigh and then walks off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both 
                         have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, 
                         not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody 
                         loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't care... what everyone likes. 
                         Ogres are not like cakes.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what else everybody likes? 
                         Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, 
                         you say, "Let's get some parfait," they 
                         say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? 
                         Parfaits are delicious.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! You dense, irritating, miniature 
                         beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! 
                         And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Parfaits may be the most delicious thing 
                         on the whole damn planet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, I think I preferred your humming.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Do you have a tissue or something? I'm 
                         making a mess. Just the word parfait 
                         make me start slobbering.
 
               They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
               a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
               to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
               so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
 
               DRAGON'S KEEP

               Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to 
               house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
                         You gotta warn somebody before you just 
                         crack one off. My mouth was open and 
                         everything.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd 
                         be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We 
                         must be getting close.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking 
                         about it's the brimstone. I know what 
                         I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It 
                         didn't come off no stone neither.
 
                         
               They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
               is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
               the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
               foreboding.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Sure, it's big enough, but look at the 
                         location. (laughs...then the laugh turns 
                         into a groan)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said 
                         ogres have layers?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, aye.

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, I have a bit of a confession to 
                         make. Donkeys don't have layers. We 
                         wear our fear right out there on our 
                         sleeves.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what I mean.

                                     SHREK
                         You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         No, I'm just a little uncomfortable 
                         about being on a rickety bridge over 
                         a boiling like of lava!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside 
                         ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll 
                         just tackle this thing together one 
                         little baby step at a time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Just keep moving. And don't look down.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. 
                         Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't 
                         look down. (he steps through a rotting 
                         board and ends up looking straight down 
                         into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! 
                         Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me 
                         off, please!
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you're already halfway.

                                     DONKEY
                         But I know that half is safe!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. 
                         You go back.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, no! Wait!

                                     SHREK
                         Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance 
                         then, shall me? (bounces and sways the 
                         bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't do that!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces 
                         the bridge again)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, that!

                                     SHREK
                         Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to 
                         bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across 
                         the bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

                                     SHREK
                         You said do it! I'm doin' it.

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, 
                         I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) 
                         Oh!
 
                                     SHREK
                         That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks 
                         towards the castle)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. So where is this fire-breathing 
                         pain-in-the-neck anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
                         (chuckles)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
 
                         
               INSIDE THE CASTLE

                                     DONKEY
                         You afraid?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         But...

                                     SHREK
                         Shh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton 
                         and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong 
                         with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 
                         response to an unfamiliar situation. 
                         Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might 
                         add. With a dragon that breathes fire 
                         and eats knights and breathes fire, 
                         it sure doesn't mean you're a coward 
                         if you're a little scared. I sure as 
                         heck ain't no coward. I know that.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. 
                         Now go over there and see if you can 
                         find any stairs.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (putting on a helmet) The princess will 
                         be up the stairs in the highest room 
                         in the tallest tower.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What makes you think she'll be there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I read it in a book once. (walks off)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle 
                         the stairs. I'll find those stairs. 
                         I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs 
                         won't know which way they're goin'. 
                         (walks off)
 
               EMPTY ROOM

               Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it 
                         to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm 
                         the stair master. I've mastered the 
                         stairs. I wish I had a step right here. 
                         I'd step all over it.
 
               ELSEWHERE

               Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.

                                     SHREK
                         Well, at least we know where the princess 
                         is, but where's the...
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Dragon!

               Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. 
               Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon 
               breathes fire.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, look out! (he manages to get 
                         a hold of the dragons tail and holds 
                         on) Got ya!
 
               The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek 
               goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the 
               tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying 
               on the floor.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Aah! Aah!

               Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small 
               part of the bridge he's on.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, 
                         what large teeth you have. (the dragon 
                         growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. 
                         I know you probably hear this all time 
                         from your food, but you must bleach, 
                         'cause that is one dazzling smile you 
                         got there. Do I detect a hint of minty 
                         freshness? And you know what else? You're 
                         - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! 
                         I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 
                         You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 
                         (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes 
                         at him) What's the matter with you? 
                         You got something in your eye? Ohh. 
                         Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, 
                         but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon 
                         blows a smoke ring in the shape of a 
                         heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm 
                         an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd 
                         work out if you're gonna blow smoke 
                         rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him 
                         up with her teeth and carries him off) 
                         No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
 
               FIONA'S ROOM

               Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona 
               so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She 
               then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off 
               the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. 
               Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for 
               a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders 
               and shakes her away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Oh! Oh!

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up!

                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         Are you Princess Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

                                     FIONA
                         But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our 
                         first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, 
                         romantic moment?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should 
                         sweep me off my feet out yonder window 
                         and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         You've had a lot of time to plan this, 
                         haven't you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) Mm-hmm.

               Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down 
               the hallway.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But we have to savor this moment! You 
                         could recite an epic poem for me. A 
                         ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I don't think so.

                                     FIONA
                         Can I at least know the name of my champion?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     FIONA
                         Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds 
                         out a handkerchief) I pray that you 
                         take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Thanks!

               Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.

                                     FIONA
                         (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         It's on my to-do list. Now come on! 
                         (takes off running and drags Fiona behind 
                         him.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         But this isn't right! You were meant 
                         to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. 
                         That's what all the other knights did.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, right before they burst into flame.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly 
                         stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek 
                         ignores her and heads for a wooden door 
                         off to the side.) Wait. Where are you 
                         going? The exit's over there.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I have to save my ass.

                                     FIONA
                         What kind of knight are you?

                                     SHREK
                         One of a kind. (opens the door into 
                         the throne room)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. 
                         I believe it's healthy to get to know 
                         someone over a long period of time. 
                         Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs 
                         worriedly) (we see him up close and 
                         from a distance as Shrek sneaks into 
                         the room) I don't want to rush into 
                         a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally 
                         ready for a commitment of, uh, this 
                         - - Magnitude really is the word I'm 
                         looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that 
                         is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what 
                         are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just 
                         back up a little and take this one step 
                         at a time. We really should get to know 
                         each other first as friends or pen pals. 
                         I'm on the road a lot, but I just love 
                         receiving cards - - I'd really love 
                         to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's 
                         my tail! That's my personal tail. You're 
                         gonna tear it off. I don't give permission 
                         - - What are you gonna do with that? 
                         Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. 
                         No, no, no. No! Oh!
 
               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings 
               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks 
               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. 
               He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps 
               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. 
               Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and 
               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto 
               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms 
               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey 
               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and 
               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hi, Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         It talks!

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's 
                         the trick.
 
               They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots 
               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a 
               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His 
               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles 
               off and walks lightly.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

               Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll 
                         take care of the dragon.
 
               Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the 
               castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping 
               chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that 
               is still around the dragons neck.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (echoing) Run!

               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot 
               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons 
               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on 
               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They 
               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look 
               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to 
               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the 
               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs 
               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a 
               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You 
                         did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. 
                         (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) 
                         You're - - You're wonderful. You're... 
                         (turns and sees Shrek fall down the 
                         hill and bump into Donkey) a little 
                         unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed 
                         is great, and thy heart is pure. I am 
                         eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears 
                         his throat.) And where would a brave 
                         knight be without his noble steed?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I hope you heard that. She called me 
                         a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         The battle is won. You may remove your 
                         helmet, good Sir Knight.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, no.

                                     FIONA
                         Why not?

                                     SHREK
                         I have helmet hair.

                                     FIONA
                         Please. I would'st look upon the face 
                         of my rescuer.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

                                     FIONA
                         But how will you kiss me?

                                     SHREK
                         What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the 
                         job description.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Maybe it's a perk.

                                     FIONA
                         No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know 
                         how it goes. A princess locked in a 
                         tower and beset by a dragon is rescued 
                         by a brave knight, and then they share 
                         true love's first kiss.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. 
                         Wait. You think that Shrek is you true 
                         love?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes.

               Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.

                                     DONKEY
                         You think Shrek is your true love!
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         What is so funny?

                                     SHREK
                         Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: 
                         Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. 
                         Now - - Now remove your helmet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look. I really don't think this is a 
                         good idea.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Just take off the helmet.

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not going to.

                                     FIONA
                         Take it off.

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FIONA
                         Now!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. 
                         (takes off his helmet)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You- - You're a- - an ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is 
                         all wrong. You're not supposed to be 
                         an ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Princess, I was sent to rescue you by 
                         Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who 
                         wants to marry you.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Then why didn't he come rescue me?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Good question. You should ask him that 
                         when we get there.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But I have to be rescued by my true 
                         love, not by some ogre and his- - his 
                         pet.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, so much for noble steed.

                                     SHREK
                         You're not making my job any easier.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. 
                         You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he 
                         wants to rescue me properly, I'll be 
                         waiting for him right here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all 
                         right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. 
                         (he swiftly picks her up and swings 
                         her over his shoulder like she was a 
                         sack of potatoes)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

                                     SHREK
                         Ya comin', Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm right behind ya.

                                     FIONA
                         Put me down, or you will suffer the 
                         consequences! This is not dignified! 
                         Put me down!
 
               WOODS

               A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just 
               hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, so here's another question. Say 
                         there's a woman that digs you, right, 
                         but you don't really like her that way. 
                         How do you let her down real easy so 
                         her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't 
                         get burned to a crisp and eaten?
 
                                     FIONA
                         You just tell her she's not your true 
                         love. Everyone knows what happens when 
                         you find your...(Shrek drops her on 
                         the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to 
                         DuLoc the better.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You're gonna love it there, Princess. 
                         It's beautiful!
 
                                     FIONA
                         And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? 
                         What's he like?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Let me put it this way, Princess. Men 
                         of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. 
                         (he and Donkey laugh)
 
               Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off 
               the dust and grime.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't know. There are those who think 
                         little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: 
                         Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're 
                         just jealous you can never measure up 
                         to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. 
                         But I'll let you do the "measuring" 
                         when you see him tomorrow.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow? 
                         It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop 
                         to make camp?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, that'll take longer. We can keep 
                         going.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But there's robbers in the woods.

                                     DONKEY
                         Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting 
                         to sound good.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything 
                         we're going to see in this forest.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I need to find somewhere to camp now!
 
                         
               Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.
 
               
               MOUNTAIN CLIFF

               Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves 
               a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! Over here.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, we can do better than that. I 
                         don't think this is fit for a princess.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         No, no, it's perfect. It just needs 
                         a few homey touches.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Homey touches? Like what? (he hears 
                         a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona 
                         who has torn the bark off of a tree.)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee 
                         good night. (goes into the cave and 
                         puts the bark door up behind her)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You want me to read you a bedtime story? 
                         I will.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (os) I said good night!

               Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the 
               boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona 
               still inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, What are you doing?

                                     SHREK
                         (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, 
                         come on. I was just kidding.
 
               LATER THAT NIGHT

               Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring 
               up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations 
               to Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, 
                         the only ogre to ever spit over three 
                         wheat fields.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future 
                         from these stars?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. 
                         They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, 
                         the Flatulent. You can guess what he's 
                         famous for.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I know you're making this up.

                                     SHREK
                         No, look. There he is, and there's the 
                         group of hunters running away from his 
                         stench.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little 
                         dots.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, Donkey, sometimes things are 
                         more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what 
                         we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Our swamp?

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, when we're through rescuing 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's 
                         no "our". There's just me and my swamp. 
                         The first thing I'm gonna do is build 
                         a ten-foot wall around my land.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real 
                         deep just now. You know what I think? 
                         I think this whole wall thing is just 
                         a way to keep somebody out.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, do ya think?

                                     DONKEY
                         Are you hidin' something?

                                     SHREK
                         Never mind, Donkey.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, this is another one of those onion 
                         things, isn't it?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, this is one of those drop-it and 
                         leave-it alone things.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Why don't you want to talk about it?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Why do you want to talk about it?

                                     DONKEY
                         Why are you blocking?

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not blocking.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, yes, you are.

                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm warning you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Who you trying to keep out?

                                     SHREK
                         Everyone! Okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. 
                         (grins)
 
               At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to 
               the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and 
                         walks over to the edge of the cliff 
                         and sits down)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What's your problem? What you got against 
                         the whole world anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look, I'm not the one with the problem, 
                         okay? It's the world that seems to have 
                         a problem with me. People take one look 
                         at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before 
                         they even know me. That's why I'm better 
                         off alone.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what? When we met, I didn't 
                         think you was just a big, stupid, ugly 
                         ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     DONKEY
                         So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small 
                         and Annoying.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny 
                         one, right there. That one there?
 
                         
               Fiona puts the door back.

                                     SHREK
                         That's the moon.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, okay.

               DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom

               The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays 
               in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic 
               Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, 
                         show her to me. Show me the princess.
 
                         
                                     MIRROR
                         Hmph.

               The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ah. Perfect.

               Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up 
               to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly 
               at her image in the mirror.
 
               MORNING

               Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey 
               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes 
               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along 
               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles 
               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too 
               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but 
               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona 
               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still 
               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking 
               in his sleep.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like 
                         it like that. Come on, baby. I said 
                         I like it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

                                     DONKEY
                         Huh? What?

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up.

                                     DONKEY
                         What? (stretches and yawns)

                                     FIONA
                         Good morning. Hm, how do you like your 
                         eggs?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good morning, Princess!

               Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.

                                     SHREK
                         What's all this about?

                                     FIONA
                         You know, we kind of got off to a bad 
                         start yesterday. I wanted to make it 
                         up to you. I mean, after all, you did 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, thanks.

               Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.

                                     FIONA
                         Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead 
                         of us. (walks off)
 
               LATER

               They are once again on their way. They are walking through the 
               forest. Shrek belches.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         What? It's a compliment. Better out 
                         than in, I always say. (laughs)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, it's no way to behave in front 
                         of a princess.
 
               Fiona belches

                                     FIONA
                         Thanks.

                                     DONKEY
                         She's as nasty as you are.

                                     SHREK
                         (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly 
                         what I expected.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people 
                         before you get to know them.
 
               She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly 
               from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into 
               a tree.
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         La liberte! Hey!

                                     SHREK
                         Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! 
                         And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses 
                         up her arm while Fiona pulls back in 
                         disgust)...beast.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! That's my princess! Go find you 
                         own!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a 
                         little busy here?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't 
                         know who you think you are!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please 
                         let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. 
                         (laughs)
 
               Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out 
               from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I steal from the rich and give to the 
                         needy.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He takes a wee percentage,

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty 
                         damsels, man, I'm good.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Break it down. I like an honest fight 
                         and a saucy little maid...
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What he's basically saying is he likes 
                         to get...
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush 
                         grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.
 
                         
                                     MERRY MEN
                         That's bad.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         When a beauty's with a beast it makes 
                         me awfully mad.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He's mad, he's really, really mad.
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I'll take my blade and ram it through 
                         your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 
                         'cause I'm about to start...
 
               There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and 
               knocks Robin Hood unconscious.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Man, that was annoying!

               Shrek looks at her in admiration.

                                     MERRY MAN
                         Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at 
                         Fiona but she ducks out of the way)
 
                         
               The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to 
               get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.
 
               
               Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and 
               then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is 
               a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in 
               mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, 
               and Fiona begins walking away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, shall we?

                                     SHREK
                         Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins 
                         walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, 
                         whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come 
                         from?
 
                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         That! Back there. That was amazing! 
                         Where did you learn that?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, 
                         uh, one has to learn these things in 
                         case there's a...(gasps and points) 
                         there's an arrow in your butt!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you 
                         look at that? (he goes to pull it out 
                         but flinches because it's tender)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so 
                         sorry.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (walking up) Why? What's wrong?

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek's hurt.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, 
                         Shrek's gonna die.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm 
                         too young for you to die. Keep you legs 
                         elevated. Turn your head and cough. 
                         Does anyone know the Heimlich?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help 
                         Shrek, run into the woods and find me 
                         a blue flower with red thorns.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on 
                         it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die 
                         Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay 
                         away from the light!

                         (like it's obvious) For getting rid 
                         of Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ah.

                                     FIONA
                         Now you hold still, and I'll yank this 
                         thing out. (gives the arrow a little 
                         pull)
 
                                     SHREK
                         (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the 
                         yankin'.
 
               As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and 
               Shrek keeps dodging her hands.
 
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

                         Now, hold on.

                         Don't move.

                         hand over her face to stop her from 
                         getting at the arrow) Okay. What do 
                         you propose we do?

                         Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall 
                         over with Fiona on top of him)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ahem.

                                     SHREK
                         (throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing 
                         happend. We were just, uh - -
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Look, if you wanted to be alone, all 
                         you had to do was ask. Okay?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, come on! That's the last thing on 
                         my mind. The princess here was just- 
                         - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he 
                         turns to look at Fiona who holds up 
                         the arrow with a smile) Ow!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle) 
                         That's...is that blood?
 
               Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue 
               on their way.
 
               There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. 
               Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a 
               small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as 
               Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back 
               into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting 
               and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb 
               that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it 
               around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins 
               eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. 
               Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting 
               it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning 
               it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group 
               arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.
 
               WINDMILL

                                     SHREK
                         There it is, Princess. Your future awaits 
                         you.
 
                                     FIONA
                         That's DuLoc?

                                     DONKEY
                         Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks 
                         Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, 
                         which I think means he has a really...(Shrek 
                         steps on his hoof) Ow!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move 
                         on.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried 
                         about Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     FIONA
                         I mean, look at him. He doesn't look 
                         so good.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What are you talking about? I'm fine.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's 
                         what they always say, and then next 
                         thing you know, you're on your back. 
                         (pause) Dead.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, she's right. You look awful. 
                         Do you want to sit down?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I didn't want to say nothin', but I 
                         got this twinge in my neck, and when 
                         I turn my head like this, look, (turns 
                         his neck in a very sharp way until his 
                         head is completely sideways) Ow! See?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'll get the firewood.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't 
                         feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) 
                         I don't have any toes! I think I need 
                         a hug.
 
               SUNSET

               Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while 
               Fiona eats.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Mmm. This is good. This is really good. 
                         What is this?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

                                     FIONA
                         No kidding. Well, this is delicious.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, they're also great in stews. Now, 
                         I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean 
                         weed rat stew. (chuckles)
 
               Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs.

                                     FIONA
                         I guess I'll be dining a little differently 
                         tomorrow night.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp 
                         sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff 
                         for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare 
                         - - you name it.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I'd like that.

               They smiles at each other.

                                     SHREK
                         Um, Princess?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                                     SHREK
                         I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) 
                         Are you gonna eat that?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? 
                         Just look at that sunset.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's 
                         late. I-It's very late.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     DONKEY
                         Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on 
                         here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't 
                         you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. 
                         You know, I'd better go inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to 
                         be afraid of the dark, too, until - 
                         - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of 
                         the dark.
 
               Shrek sighs

                                     FIONA
                         Good night.

                                     SHREK
                         Good night.

               Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks 
               at Shrek with a new eye.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on 
                         here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, what are you talkin' about?

                                     DONKEY
                         I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm 
                         an animal, and I got instincts. And 
                         I know you two were diggin' on each 
                         other. I could feel it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You're crazy. I'm just bringing her 
                         back to Farquaad.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell 
                         the pheromones. Just go on in and tell 
                         her how you feel.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, 
                         even if I did tell her that, well, you 
                         know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause 
                         I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm 
                         - -
 
                                     DONKEY
                         An ogre?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. An ogre.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'?

                                     SHREK
                         To get... move firewood. (sighs)

               Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already 
               is.
 
               TIME LAPSE

               Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is 
               nowhere to be seen.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, 
                         where are you? Princess?
 
               Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing 
                         no games.
 
               Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't 
               look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking 
               out.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Aah!

                                     FIONA
                         Oh, no!

                                     DONKEY
                         No, help!

                                     FIONA
                         Shh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

                                     FIONA
                         No, it's okay. It's okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         What did you do with the princess?
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey, I'm the princess.

                                     DONKEY
                         Aah!

                                     FIONA
                         It's me, in this body.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to 
                         her stomach) Can you hear me?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, 
                         keep breathing! I'll get you out of 
                         there!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No!

                         Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

                         Shh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek!

                         This is me.

               Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets 
               down.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? What happened to you? You're, 
                         uh, uh, uh, different.
 
                                     FIONA
                         I'm ugly, okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 
                         'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a 
                         bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. 
                         Now - -
 
                                     FIONA
                         No. I - - I've been this way as long 
                         as I can remember.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What do you mean? Look, I ain't never 
                         seen you like this before.
 
                                     FIONA
                         It only happens when sun goes down. 
                         "By night one way, by day another. This 
                         shall be the norm... until you find 
                         true love's first kiss... and then take 
                         love's true form."
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know 
                         you wrote poetry.
 
                                     FIONA
                         It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little 
                         girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every 
                         night I become this. This horrible, 
                         ugly beast! I was placed in a tower 
                         to await the day my true love would 
                         rescue me. That's why I have to marry 
                         Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun 
                         sets and he sees me like this. (begins 
                         to cry)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, all right. Calm down. Look, 
                         it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. 
                         Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. 
                         But you only look like this at night.

                         But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this 
                         is not how a princess is meant to look.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry 
                         Farquaad?
 
                                     FIONA
                         I have to. Only my true love's kiss 
                         can break the spell.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But, you know, um, you're kind of an 
                         orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a 
                         lot in common.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Shrek?

               OUTSIDE

               Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his 
               hand.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how's 
                         it going, first of all? Good? Um, good 
                         for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower 
                         and thought of you because it's pretty 
                         and - - well, I don't really like it, 
                         but I thought you might like it 'cause 
                         you're pretty. But I like you anyway. 
                         I'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. 
                         Okay, here we go.
 
               He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey 
               and Fiona talking.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (os) I can't just marry whoever I want. 
                         Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, 
                         really, who can ever love a beast so 
                         hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" 
                         don't go together. That's why I can't 
                         stay here with Shrek.
 
               Shrek steps back in shock.

                                     FIONA
                         (os) My only chance to live happily 
                         ever after is to marry my true love.
 
                         
               Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks 
               away.
 
               INSIDE

                                     FIONA
                         Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how 
                         it has to be. It's the only way to break 
                         the spell.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         No! You can't breathe a word. No one 
                         must ever know.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What's the point of being able to talk 
                         if you gotta keep secrets?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Promise you won't tell. Promise!

                                     DONKEY
                         All right, all right. I won't tell him. 
                         But you should. (goes outside) I just 
                         know before this is over, I'm gonna 
                         need a whole lot of serious therapy. 
                         Look at my eye twitchin'.
 
               Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks 
               down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back 
               inside the windmill.
 
               MORNING

               Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still 
               awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.
 
                                     FIONA
                         I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, 
                         I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly 
                         runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek! 
                         Shrek, there's something I want...(she 
                         looks and sees the rising sun, and as 
                         the sun crests the sky she turns back 
                         into a human.)
 
               Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards 
               her.
 
                                     FIONA

                         I have to tell you.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You don't have to tell me anything, 
                         Princess. I heard enough last night.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         You heard what I said?

                         Every word.

                                     FIONA
                         I thought you'd understand.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who 
                         could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         But I thought that wouldn't matter to 
                         you.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at 
                         him in shock. He looks past her and 
                         spots a group approaching.) Ah, right 
                         on time. Princess, I've brought you 
                         a little something.
 
               Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal 
               sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only 
               like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers 
               march by.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots 
                         the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? 
                         Couldn't have been the donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona.

                                     SHREK
                         As promised. Now hand it over.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece 
                         of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared 
                         out, as agreed. Take it and go before 
                         I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) 
                         Forgive me, Princess, for startling 
                         you, but you startled me, for I have 
                         never seen such a radiant beauty before. 
                         I'm Lord Farquaad.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad 
                         snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, 
                         for I was just saying a short... (Watches 
                         as Farquaad is lifted off his horse 
                         and set down in front of her. He comes 
                         to her waist.) farewell.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have 
                         to waste good manners on the ogre. It's 
                         not like it has feelings.
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, you're right. It doesn't.

               Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless 
                         Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. 
                         Will you be the perfect bride for the 
                         perfect groom?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would 
                         make - -
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start 
                         the plans, for tomorrow we wed!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get 
                         married today before the sun sets.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. 
                         The sooner, the better. There's so much 
                         to do! There's the caterer, the cake, 
                         the band, the guest list. Captain, round 
                         up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona 
                         on the back of his horse)
 
                                     FIONA
                         Fare-thee-well, ogre.

               Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches 
               them go.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting

                         Yeah? So what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, there's something about her you 
                         don't know. Look, I talked to her last 
                         night, She's - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         I know you talked to her last night. 
                         You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if 
                         you two are such good friends, why don't 
                         you follow her home?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

                                     SHREK
                         I told you, didn't I? You're not coming 
                         home with me. I live alone! My swamp! 
                         Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! 
                         Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, 
                         talking donkeys!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But I thought - -

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! 
                         (stomps off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek.

               Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona 
               being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running 
               into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner 
               alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.
 
               SHREK'S HOME

               Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes 
               outside to investigate.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues 
                         with what he's doing.) What are you 
                         doing?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I would think, of all people, you would 
                         recognize a wall when you see one.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed 
                         to go around my swamp, not through it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         It is around your half. See that's your 
                         half, and this is my half.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! Your half. Hmm.

                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. 
                         I did half the work. I get half the 
                         booty. Now hand me that big old rock, 
                         the one that looks like your head.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Back off!

                                     DONKEY
                         No, you back off.

                                     SHREK
                         This is my swamp!

                                     DONKEY
                         Our swamp.

                                     SHREK
                         (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working 
                         with) Let go, Donkey!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You let go.

                                     SHREK
                         Stubborn jackass!

                                     DONKEY
                         Smelly ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks 
                         away)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through 
                         with you yet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I'm through with you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, 
                         "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now 
                         it's my turn! So you just shut up and 
                         pay attention! You are mean to me. You 
                         insult me and you don't appreciate anything 
                         that I do! You're always pushing me 
                         around or pushing me away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so 
                         bad, how come you came back?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Because that's what friends do! They 
                         forgive each other!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive 
                         you... for stabbin' me in the back! 
                         (goes into the outhouse and slams the 
                         door)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, 
                         onion boy, you're afraid of your own 
                         feelings.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Go away!

                                     DONKEY
                         There you are , doing it again just 
                         like you did to Fiona. All she ever 
                         do was like you, maybe even love you.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a 
                         hideous creature. I heard the two of 
                         you talking.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         She wasn't talkin' about you. She was 
                         talkin' about, uh, somebody else.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't 
                         talking about me? Well, then who was 
                         she talking about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. 
                         You don't wanna listen to me. Right? 
                         Right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) 
                         I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, that's what friends are for, right?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Right. Friends?

                                     DONKEY
                         Friends.

                                     SHREK
                         So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         What are you asking me for? Why don't 
                         you just go ask her?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The wedding! We'll never make it in 
                         time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's 
                         a will, there's a way and I have a way. 
                         (whistles)
 
               Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so 
               they can climb on.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
 
                         
               They both laugh.

                                     SHREK
                         Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a 
                         noogie)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, all right. Don't get all 
                         slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All 
                         right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't 
                         had a chance to install the seat belts 
                         yet.
 
               They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc.

               DULOC - CHURCH

               Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there. 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.
 
               
                                     PRIEST
                         People of DuLoc, we gather here today 
                         to bear witness to the union....

                         (eyeing the setting sun) Um-

                                     PRIEST
                         ...of our new king...

                                     FIONA
                         Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead 
                         to the "I do's"?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (chuckles and then motions to the priest 
                         to indulge Fiona) Go on.
 
               COURTYARD

               Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with 
               a boom. The guards all take off running.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. 
                         If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 
                         that? (she nods and goes after the guards) 
                         Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You 
                         wanna do this right, don't you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         (at the Church door) What are you talking 
                         about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         There's a line you gotta wait for. The 
                         preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or 
                         forever hold your peace." That's when 
                         you say, "I object!"
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't have time for this!

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen 
                         to me! Look, you love this woman, don't 
                         you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         You wanna hold her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes!

                                     DONKEY
                         (singing James Brown style) Then you 
                         got to, got to try a little tenderness. 
                         (normal) The chicks love that romantic 
                         crap!
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right! Cut it out. When does this 
                         guy say the line?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         We gotta check it out.

               INSIDE CHURCH

               As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the 
               windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.
 
                                     PRIEST
                         And so, by the power vested in me...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     SHREK
                         What do you see?

                                     DONKEY
                         The whole town's in there.

               Inside

                                     PRIEST
                         I now pronounce you husband and wife...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     DONKEY
                         They're at the altar.

               Inside

                                     PRIEST
                         ...king and queen.

               Outside

                                     DONKEY
                         Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, for the love of Pete!

               He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.
 
               
               INSIDE CHURCH

                                     SHREK
                         (running toward the alter) I object!

                         Shrek?

               The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, now what does he want?

                                     SHREK
                         (to congregation as he reaches the front 
                         of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin' 
                         a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first 
                         of all. Very clean.
 
                                     FIONA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, it's rude enough being alive 
                         when no one wants you, but showing up 
                         uninvited to a wedding...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona! I need to talk to you.

                                     FIONA
                         Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little 
                         late for that, so if you'll excuse me 
                         - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you can't marry him.

                                     FIONA
                         And why not?

                                     SHREK
                         Because- - Because he's just marring 
                         you so he can be king.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         He's not your true love.

                                     FIONA
                         And what do you know about true love?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen 
                         in love with the princess! Oh, good 
                         Lord. (laughs)
 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The 
               whole congregation laughs.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         An ogre and a princess!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek, is this true?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, 
                         my love, we're but a kiss away from 
                         our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! 
                         (puckers his lips and leans toward her, 
                         but she pulls back.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looking at the setting sun) "By night 
                         one way, by day another." (to Shrek) 
                         I wanted to show you before.
 
               She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. 
               She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona 
                         smiles)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! 
                         I order you to get that out of my sight 
                         now! Get them! Get them both!
 
               The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights 
               them.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This 
                         marriage is binding, and that makes 
                         me king! See? See?
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, let go of me! Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Don't just stand there, you morons.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll make you regret the day we met. 
                         I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll 
                         beg for death to save you!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And 
                         as for you, my wife...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll have you locked back in that tower 
                         for the rest of your days! I'm king!
 
                         
               Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I will have order! I will have perfection! 
                         I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon 
                         show up and the dragon leans down and 
                         eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon 
                         here, and I'm not afraid to use it. 
                         (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on 
                         the edge!
 
               The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth 
               and falls to the ground.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Celebrity marriages. They never last, 
                         do they?
 
               The congregation cheers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Go ahead, Shrek.

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                                     SHREK
                         I - - I love you.

                                     FIONA
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I love you too.

               Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 
               'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.
 
               
                                     CONGREGATION
                         Aawww!

               Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted 
               up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around 
               her.
 
                                     WHISPERS
                         "Until you find true love's first kiss 
                         and then take love's true form. Take 
                         love's true form. Take love's true form."
 
                         
               Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell 
               and then is slowly lowered to the ground.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are 
                         you all right?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, 
                         yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed 
                         to be beautiful.
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you ARE beautiful.

               They smile at each other.

                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) I was hoping this would be 
                         a happy ending.
 
               Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...

               THE SWAMP

               ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm 
               a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek 
               and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting 
               carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet 
               which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end 
               up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet 
               instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now 
               has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona 
               walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over 
               singing the song.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         God bless us, every one.

                                     DONKEY
                         (as he's done singing and we fade to 
                         black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't 
                         breathe. I can't breathe.
 
               THE END

                                               Final Screening Script
                         
                         
          INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT
                         
          A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light
          descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
          Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
          plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Onward Chauncey, to the highest
           room of the tallest tower! Where
           my princess awaits rescue from her
           handsome Prince Charming.
                         
          Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a
          wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a
          bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another
          stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
          In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound

          He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground. He
          strikes a dramatic pose.

           take my place as rightful King.

          Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores
          him.
                         
          A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage.

          At first, Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the
          Shrek-like beast. He pulls his sword and confronts the
          monster.

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming glares at them and then
          tries to recover. He points his sword at the monster again.
          The tower facade starts to topple.

          Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade
          falling. He cringes.
                         
          The scenery slams against the stage, but Prince Charming is
          unharmed, perfectly framed in the princesses' window. The
          crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming. He shakes
          his mangled sword at the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

          picks up his hobby horse and exits.

          Prince Charming walks through a tunnel backstage that leads
          to a door. The door has a star with his name written on it.
          He opens it.

          Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs. His make-
          shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater.
                         
          Horses whinny as a carriage passes by. The castle of Far Far
          Away can be seen on the hill in the background. Prince
          Charming breaks down and cries.
                         
          He looks up and sees a picture of the Fairy Godmother taped
          to the vanity. "Don't stop believing! Mommy's Little Angel"
          is written on the picture.

           Oh mommy.
                         
          He weeps again and then looks back at the picture. A
          determined change grows across his face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh, you're right. I can't let this
           happen. I can't.
                         
          Prince Charming looks at the castle on the hill. His
          expression hardens. He stands and faces the castle. He
          holds his chin up high.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           I am the rightful King of Far Far
           Away and I promise you this mother.
           I will restore dignity to my
           throne!
                         
          A big gust of wind blows a newspaper page across his face.
          He peels it off and looks at the headline. His eyes tense
          and narrow.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           And this time, no one will stand in
           my way!
                         
          In the newspaper is a picture of Shrek and Fiona waving to a
          crowd.
                         
          Prince Charming crumples up the newspaper in his fists.

          The camera booms down from the Far Far Away sign. The sun
          rises and the birds sing.

          The bedroom doors fly open and Donkey and the Dronkeys rush
          in. The Dronkeys head right for Shrek and Fiona. Shrek
          cowers beneath the bedclothes.

          Shrek sinks further into the blankets as the Dronkeys
          exuberantly lick him. Fiona is amused.
                         
          Donkey starts to sing "Good Morning" from Singin' in the Rain
          as he enters the room.

           "And you!"

           And you!
                         
          The Dronkeys fly out of the room, knocking down everything in
          their path.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh, they grow up so fast.
                         
          Shrek, greatly annoyed, lifts his hand and snuffs out a
          little fire on the bed left behind by the Dronkeys.
                         
                          SHREK
           Not fast enough.
                         
          Puss leaps onto the bed.

          Shrek immediately pulls the covers up over his head and
          starts to snore.

          Donkey yanks the sheets off of Fiona and Shrek. He is
          surprised to see Shrek's bare legs.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aaahhh! You know you really need

          The camera pans down from a stained glass window. The song
          "Royal Pain" by the Eels plays in the background as the
          title: "Shrek The Third" is superimposed.
                         
          A large crowd has gathered to watch the knighting. Shrek
          walks down the aisle of the church.
                         
          Shrek walks up to the knight who seems a bit nervous.
                         
          Shrek takes a sword from Puss, but he doesn't have any idea
          what he is supposed to do with it. Shrek looks at Puss, who
          indicates how to knight a person with his own sword. Shrek
          starts to knight the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           I knight thee...
                         
          Shrek accidentally stabs the knight.

          Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal
          Navy.
                         
          Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the
          boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws
          the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the
          side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.
                         
          Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their
          heads as they leave.

          Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around
          Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of
          them.

          He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair.
                         
          A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip
          cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He
          turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind
          away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.
                         
          We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into
          frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash.
                         
          Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.
                         
                          FIONA
           Ow!

          Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to
          reveal that the lips are Shrek's.
                         
          A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps
          snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and
          tighten up the zipper all the way.
                         
          A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn,
          Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP!
                         
          A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is
          tightened.
                         
          A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's
          belt. A mole is placed on his cheek.
                         
                         
          INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER
                         
          REVEAL: Shrek and Fiona standing awkwardly in outrageous
          Renaissance outfits.
                         
          Donkey gasps.

           Oh!
                         
          Puss rolls his eyes.
                         
                          PUSS
           Yeah, wow.
                         
          Fiona is uncomfortable.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh, is this really necessary?
                         
                          RAUL
                          (TO SHREK)
           Ho, ho. Quite necessary, Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           I'm Shrek, you twit.
                         
                          RAUL
           Whatever.
                         
                          PUSS
           Okay peoples! This isn't a
           rehearsal. Let's see some hustle.

           Smiles everyone, smiles!
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 9.
                         
                         
                         
          Off-screen, the Master of Ceremonies announces the couples
          arriving at the party.
                         
          Fiona turns to Shrek and sees he is not in a good mood.
                         
                          SHREK
           I don't know how much longer I can
           keep this up Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please
           just try to grin and bear it? It's
           just until Dad gets better.
                         
          Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek?
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah.
                         
                          FIONA
           You look handsome.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah. Come here, you.
                         
          She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles
          back.
                         
          Fiona puckers up her lips and Shrek leans in for a kiss, but
          their bulky outfits prevent it.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona let out a huge breath of air.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, my butt is itching up a storm
           and I can't reach it in this monkey
           suit!
                         
          Shrek tries to scratch his butt but to no avail.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh.
                          (WHISTLE)
           Hey you. Come here!
                         
          A man holding a ruby scepter walks over to Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           What's your name?

                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Eh, Fiddlesworth, sir.
                         
                          SHREK
           Hoo hoo hooo. Perfect.
                         
                         
          INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The announcer introduces Shrek and Fiona.
                         
           MASTER OF CEREMONIES
           Ladies and gentlemen, Princess
           Fiona and Sir Shrek!
                         
          The audience claps. The curtain starts to open.
          Fiddlesworth is scratching away at Shrek's butt.
                         
                          SHREK
           You've done it. Oh, a little over
           to the left, yeah. That's great.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh Shrek?
                         
          Fiddlesworth struggles to reach Shrek's itch. The crowd
          looks on in horror. Fiona tries to get his attention.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh
           yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it!
           Oh that's good!
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek...
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You
           got it. You're on it. That's
           great!
                         
                          FIONA
           SHREK!
                         
          Shrek and Fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. They both
          freeze. Shrek laughs nervously.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the
          eye. He stumbles through the crowd screaming.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ow!! My eye! My eye!
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 11.
                         
                         
                         
          As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.
                         
                          WOMAN
           What are you doing?
                         
          The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a
          guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the
          axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The
          axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona
          maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the
          vase which causes Fiona to fall over.
                         
          Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding
          Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his
          pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona!
                         
          He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the
          stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying
          through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole,
          trapping him.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Uhhh...
                          (WIMPER)
                         
          Shrek has reached Fiona who is still lying on the floor.
                         
                          SHREK
           Are you okay?
                         
                          FIONA
           Yeah. I'm fine.
                         
          Fiona's eyes suddenly widen.
                         
          Fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter
          carrying flaming skewers.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Ahhhh!
                         
          The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame
          with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and
          land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of
          the skewers out and takes a bite.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh! Shrimp! My favorite.

          The fire causes a Far Far Away shield to detach from a wooden
          ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half.
                         
          The whole stage collapses in the middle. The buffet tables
          slide toward Shrek and Fiona at the other end and collide.
                         
          CRASH! BANG!
                         
           CUT TO BLACK:
                         
                         
          INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The door to Fiona's room flies open.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's it! We're leaving!
                         
          Shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.
                         
                          FIONA
           Honey, please calm down...
                         
          Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside.
                         
                          SHREK
           Calm down? Who do you think we're
           kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut
           out for this, Fiona and I never
           will be.
                         
          Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings
          his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to
          Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I think that went pretty well.
                         
          Shrek startles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey!
                         
          Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aww, come on now Shrek!
                         
          Shrek slams the door shut.
                         
          Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on
          his pillow.
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 13.
                         
                         
                         
                          PUSS
           Some people just don't understand
           boundaries.
                         
          Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him
          outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the
          ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the
          blinds.
                         
          Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries
          to calm him down.
                         
                          FIONA
           Just think... a couple more days,
           and we'll be back home in our
           vermin-filled shack, strewn with
           fungus, filled with the rotting
           stench of mud and neglect.
                         
          This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath
          and exhales. He smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
                         
                          FIONA
           And, uh... maybe even the pitter-
           patter of little feet on the
           floor...?
                         
                          SHREK
                          (LAUGHS)
           That's right. The swamp rats will
           be spawning.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh, no... you know, what I was
           thinking of is a little bit bigger
           than a swamp rat.
                         
                          SHREK

          Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed.
                         
          He slowly emerges from behind the bed.
                         
                          SHREK
           Honey? Let's try and be rational
           about this. Have you seen a baby
           lately? They just eat and poop and
           they cry and then they cry when
           they poop and they poop when they
           cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby.
           They extra cry and they extra poop.

           Right now, you're my family.
                         
          There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open,
          revealing a Royal Page.
                         
          Shrek springs up.

           Well, somebody better be dying.

          The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's
          bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           I'm dying.
                         
          The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit.
          Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen
          comes to the King's aid and he settles down.

          The Queen is used to these kind of non-sequiturs.

          The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter.

           But your love for Shrek has taught
           me so much.
                         
          Fiona smiles. The King addresses Shrek.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           My dear boy, I am proud to call you

          The King starts wheezing and coughing. Eventually he stops.
          They think he's dead. Puss solemnly removes his hat.

           Shrek, please come hither.
                         
          Fiona gives Shrek a look. Shrek walks over to the King.
                         
                          SHREK

           This Kingdom needs a new king. You

           making jokes.
                         
          The King stares at Shrek, stone-faced. Shrek leans in
          closer.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King?
           I don't think that's such a good
           idea. There's got to be somebody

          Shrek brightens.

          Shrek leans in closer after each "is," waiting in
          anticipation. The King starts to hyperventilate.
                         
                          FIONA
           Daddy!
                         
          The King is dead. A fly comes out of his mouth and flies
          away.
                         
          Puss starts to take his hat off. The fly buzzes into frame.
          A tongue catches it. Puss puts his hat back on.
                         
                          KING HAROLD

          Puss takes his hat off.
                         
          Fiona starts to cry and hugs Shrek. The weight of the King's
          request hits Shrek. He is in a state of shock.
                         
          We hold a moment on the Queen, Shrek, Fiona, Puss and Donkey
          to let the King's passing sink in.

          Close on a statue of the late King. Shrek, Fiona, the Queen,
          and all the Fairy-tale Creatures and Princesses have gathered
          for the funeral. The Queen sets an old shoe box ("Ye Olde
          Footlocker") on top of a lily pad and sends it floating out
          into the water.
                         
          An overhead shot shows the box floating through the lily
          pads. The camera tilts up to reveal a frog choir, singing

          Fairy-tale Creatures all bow their heads solemnly.
                         
          Shrek puts his arm around Fiona.
                         
          The funeral has ended and the crowd begins to disperse.
          Shrek, Fiona and the Queen stand by the pond. The Queen
          sadly gazes at the pond.

          Smoke wafts through the screen. The camera pans down to the
          top of a piano where an ashtray with a lit cigarette burns
          and a brandy sifter is filled with coins. The camera pans
          over to a Singing Witch who turns around to reveal a
          microphone in her hand. The Singing Witch starts to sing
          "I've Never Been To Me" by Nancy Wilson.
                         
          The bar is filled with various Fairy-tale Villains. Two
          pirates sit forlornly with their mugs. The Puppet Master
          takes a drink out of a beer mug. He is surrounded by a bunch
          of empty beer mugs.
                         
          Prince Charming enters the bar.
                         
          A group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval
          mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and
          the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming.
                         
          Prince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera
          adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the
          Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes
          notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding
          Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves
          glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks
          by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White)
          playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and
          the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck.
          Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the
          bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool,
          and sits.
                         
          Prince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He
          clears his throat.

           She's not welcome here and neither
           are you.
                         
          She spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel.
                         
                          MABEL (CONT'D)
           What do you want, Charming?
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh not much, just a chance at
           redemption...
                          (LAUGHS)
           And a Fuzzy Navel.
                         
          Prince Charming stands up and turns to the bar patrons.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           And Fuzzy Navels for all my
           friends!
                         
          Captain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The
          singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool
          cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           We're not your friends.
                         
          Prince Charming grows nervous.
                         
          The Villains all approach Prince Charming.
                         
          From behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his
          shoulders and pins him on top of the bar.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ahh!
                         
          Captain Hook places his hook against Prince Charming's neck.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           You don't belong here.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You're right; oh, I mean you're
           absolutely right, but I mean, do
           any of us?
                         
                          CYCLOPS
           Do a number on his face!

                          PRINCE CHARMING
           No, no, wait, wait, wait! We are
           more alike than you think.
                         
          Prince Charming turns to the Evil Queen.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Wicked Witch. The Seven Dwarves
           saved Snow White and then what
           happened?
                         
                          EVIL QUEEN
           Oh, what's it to you?
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           They left you the un-fairest of
           them all. And now here you are,
           hustling pool to get your next
           meal. How does that feel?
                         
                          EVIL QUEEN
           Pretty unfair.
                         
          Prince Charming begins to work the crowd.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           And you? Your star puppet abandons
           the show to go and find his father.
                         
                          PUPPET MASTER
           I hate that little wooden puppet.
                         
          Prince Charming turns to Captain Hook.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           And Hook...
                         
          Prince Charming looks down at the hook.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           ... Need I say more?
                         
          Captain Hook backs off, feeling insecure about his appendage.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           And you! Frumpypigskin.
                         
                          RUMPLESTILTSKIN
           Rumplestiltskin.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Where's that first-born you were
           promised, hey?
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 22.
                         
                         
                         
          Rumplestiltskin caresses a pacifier tattoo on his forearm.
                         
          Prince Charming gains more confidence as he confronts Mabel.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Mabel, remember how you couldn't
           get your little fat foot into that
           tiny glass slipper?
                         
          Mabel sighs.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Cinderella is in Far Far Away right
           now, eating Bon Bons, cavorting
           with every little last Fairy-tale
           Creature that has ever done you
           wrong.
                         
          Prince Charming now has everyone's attention.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Once upon a time, someone decided
           that we were the losers. But there
           are two sides to every story. And
           our side has not been told.
                         
          The crowd listens, rapt.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           So who will join me? Who wants to
           come out on top for once? Who
           wants their happily ever after?!
                         
          The crowd of villains cheer and starts getting rowdy. A bar
          room brawl ensues. Prince Charming looks on, shocked. He
          ducks out of the way of a flying liquor bottle. He smiles
          nervously and lifts his fruity, Fuzzy Navel to drink.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. DOCKS - DUSK
                         
          The camera booms down from the lighthouse.
                         
                          BLIND MOUSE #1
           This way gents.
                         
          The blind mice stumble and fall trying to get down the steps
          to the dock. The Fairy-tale Creatures and Dragon have
          gathered to wish Shrek, Puss and Donkey a bon voyage as they
          set off to retrieve Arthur.
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 23.
                         
                         
                         
          On the docks, two Dronkeys chase a seagull as the camera pans
          over to Puss who breaks free of the embrace of a lady cat.
                         
                          PUSS
           It's out of my hands senorita, the
           winds of fate have blown on my
           destiny. But I will never forget
           you. You are the love of my life.
                         
          Off-screen, a cat meows and walks towards Puss.
                         
                          PUSS (CONT'D)
           As are you...
                         
          Camera pulls out to reveal more and more cats approaching
          Puss.
                         
                          PUSS (CONT'D)
           And you.
                         
          Puss starts walking away as two of the cats begin to engage
          in a cat fight. They are hissing at each other as Puss backs
          away from them and into another.
                         
                          PUSS (CONT'D)
           And, uh... hi. I don't know you,
           but I'd like to. I gotta go.
                         
          Puss runs out of frame. Cut to Dragon, who is talking to
          Donkey. Puss runs past them in the background. Dragon lets
          out a soft wail.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I know, I know... I don't want to
           leave you either baby, but you know
           how Shrek is. The dude's lost
           without me.
                         
          She gives him an understanding smile.
                         
                          DONKEY
           But don't worry. I'll send you
           airmail kisses everyday!
                         
          He blows her a kiss and she catches it. He looks down at his
          children, holding back tears.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Alright, be strong babies! Be
           strong. Now, Coco, Peanut, you
           listen to Mama, alright? And
           Bananas, no more roastin'
           marshmallows on your sister's head.

          Bananas lets out a fiery sneeze.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ah, that's my special boy. Oh,
           come over here, all of you. Give
           your Daddy a big hug!
                         
          The baby Dronkeys fly around their Daddy.
                         
          The Dronkey that Fiona is holding flies off to join Donkey
          and the others.
                         
          Fiona nervously takes in a breath.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek, maybe you should just stay
           and be King.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could
           ever run a kingdom. That's why your
           cousin Arthur's the perfect choice.
                         
                          FIONA
           It's not that. No. It's, you
           see...
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           And if he gives me any trouble,
           I've always got persuasion and
           reason.
           (holds up his right fist)
           Here's persuasion,
           (holds up his left fist)
           and here's reason.
                         
          Shrek chuckles. Fiona gives him a look. Shrek reassures her.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you
           and me and our swamp.
                         
                          FIONA
                          (HESITANT)
           It's not going to be just you and
           me.
                         
          The ship's fog horn sounds.
                         
                          SHIP CAPTAIN
           All aboard!

                          SHREK
           It will be. I promise. I love
           you.
                         
          He kisses her and joins Puss and Donkey on the boat.
                         
          He title proudly reads: H.R.M CRUSHING RESPONSIBILITY II
                         
          The boat sets sail. The Dronkeys spell out "We Love You
          Daddy" with smoke in the sky.
                         
                          FAIRYTALE CREATURES
           Awwwwwwwww!
                         
                          PIG #1
           That's lovely.
                         
          Donkey waves to his kids, sobs.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Bye bye babies!
                         
          Fiona runs after the boat.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek!
                         
          Shrek leans against the rail, calling out to her.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah?
                         
                          FIONA
           Wait!
                         
                          SHREK
           What is it?
                         
          She smiles and takes a deep breath.
                         
                          FIONA
           I'm, I'm-
                         
          The Ship Captain blows a fog horn and cuts her off. Shrek
          smiles back at her.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (LAUGHS)
           I love you too honey!

          The Ship Captain starts to blow again. Shrek grabs the horn
          and throws it overboard.
                         
                          SHREK
           You're what?!

           I said I'm pregnant!
                         
          The Fairy-tale Creatures behind Fiona cheer.

           Uh... what was that?
                         
                          FIONA
           You're going to be a father!

           That's great.
                         
                          FIONA
           Really? I'm glad you think so! I
           love you.
                         
          Shrek smiles back at Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah...

          Fiona smiles as the Queen places a hand on her shoulder.
                         
          Overjoyed at the news, Donkey pops up onto the railing.

          The fog horn blasts again as the boat disappears into the
          fog.

          EXT. BOAT CABIN - NIGHT
                         
          The boat travels along in the open sea. Shrek is fast asleep
          as the boat travels through an estuary and beaches itself.
                         
          Shrek wakes up. He opens the cabin door.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahhh. Home.
                         
          He smiles to himself. The boat has beached itself right
          outside of Shrek's swamp house.
                         
          He leaps off the boat.
                         
                          SHREK
           Woohoo!

          He sashays through the front door with his eyes closed,
          presenting himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona!
                         
          After a moment of silence, he opens his eyes, realizing that
          Fiona is not there.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona?
                         
          He looks around the room, puzzled. The door slams closed
          behind him.

          A baby carriage rolls slowly into frame behind him. He turns
          slowly and sees the baby carriage covered with a blanket.
          Shrek removes the blanket, revealing a baby ogre, smiling
          innocently at him.
                         
                          SHREK
           Huh? Oh no.
                         
          The baby burps.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (AMUSED)
           Better out than in, I always say.
           Ha ha!
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Hiccup!
                         
          This time the baby's burp turns into projectile vomit aimed
          directly at Shrek. Shrek puts his hand up to block the
          vomit, but to no avail. The baby continues to vomit, but
          eventually stops after completely soiling himself and Shrek.
          The baby looks like it's about to cry. Shrek raises his
          hands.
                         
                          SHREK
           No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha.
           It's okay. It's gonna be alright.
                         
          Shrek picks the baby up, smiling at it cautiously. He holds
          it awkwardly for a few seconds, then looks up and realizes
          that his house is filled with babies.
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Da-Da!
                         
          Babies roll around his living room, tearing the fabric off
          his chair. The chair reclines, catapulting one of the babies
          onto Shrek's head. A standing lamp with a baby on top falls,
          and Shrek dives to catch him. Another baby is pulling the
          tablecloth, causing lethal knives to fly straight at him.
          Shrek snatches the baby away just before he is impaled. One
          of the babies strikes a match near the fireplace. Shrek runs
          over, picks up the baby and blows out the match. He takes a
          baby out of the cauldron.
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya?
           No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No.
                         
          Shrek panics. A baby is knocking glass jars off the shelf.
          Shrek catches him before he crawls off of it. Shrek runs
          through the room picking up babies.

          After he has collected as many babies as he can, Shrek slides
          open the curtain to his bedroom.
                         
                          SHREK
           Huh?
                         
          He sees a baby sitting in his bed, smiling up at him. The
          baby shrugs.
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Bubabatoo?
                         
          Suddenly, Shrek hears a loud rumble. He turns around.
          Babies start pouring out of the window and the fireplace.
          First there is one, then two, then thirty more follow.
          Hundreds of them start piling in.
                         
          Shrek makes a run for the doorway, but no matter how hard he
          runs, the doorway keeps getting farther and farther away! He
          keeps trying, hundreds of babies trailing behind.

          Finally, Shrek reaches the door and opens it. He slams it
          shut behind him and closes his eyes. Everything is quiet.
          He opens his eyes and finds himself on stage in front of his
          high school.
                         
          Shrek looks up to find a graduation cap on his head. The
          audience is full of ogre babies laughing at him. The camera
          pulls back to reveal Shrek standing at the podium, naked.

          Shrek's eyes pop open, he sits upright and tries to compose
          himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahhhh! Oh, Donkey! Donkey, wake-
           up!
                         
          Donkey and Puss turn around, but they both have baby-ogre
          faces! Donkey makes a baby noise. As the camera zooms in,
          Donkey's eyes glow red and his teeth become sharp and pointy.

           be a father.
                         
          Donkey and Puss look at each other. He gets up and walks to
          the ship's railing.
                         
                          SHREK

                          PUSS
           Allow me to explain. You see, when
           a man has certain feelings for a
           woman, a powerful urge sweeps over
           him...
                         
                          SHREK
           I know how it happened. I just
           can't believe it.
                         
          Shrek walks away.
                         
          Donkey leans over to Puss.

           Donkey, can you just cut to the
           part where you're supposed to make
           me feel better?
                         
          Shrek slumps against the rail. Puss hops up on the railing
          and whispers into Shrek's other ear.
                         
                          PUSS
           You know I love Fiona, Boss.
           Right?
                          (CONFIDENTIALLY)
           But what I'm talking about here is
           you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice-
           cold pitcher of mojitos, and two
           weeks of nothing but fishing.
                         
          Puss makes a "let's go fishing" gesture by casting an
          imaginary rod into the ocean. Donkey is right there to
          whisper in Shrek's other ear.
                         
                          DONKEY

           ruining. It's the kid's.
                         
          Donkey and Puss pause as Shrek rants.
                         
                          SHREK

          Off-screen we hear mumbling from inside a locker. Shrek and
          Puss look as Donkey pushes the locker door open. He has been
          stuffed inside. Off-screen we hear some students laughing.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Yeah, you better run, you little
           punk no good-niks, `cause the days
           of "Little Donkey Dumpy Drawers"
           are over!
                         
          An "I Suck-eth" sign has been taped Donkey's butt.
                         
          Shrek spots students entering the Gymnasium. They approach a
          HALL MONITOR who stops them.
                         
                          HALL MONITOR
                         
           Hold it...
                         
          Two mascot costumed students walk up to the hall monitor.

                          COSTUME STUDENT 1
           We're here for the Mascot Contest.
                         
                          COSTUME STUDENT 2
           Grrrrr!
                         
          The Hall Monitor waves them in. Shrek gets an idea.
                         
                          SHREK
           (pleased with himself)
           We're here for the Mascot Contest
           too.
                         
          The Hall Monitor reaches out and starts painfully pinching
          and pulling Shrek's skin. Shrek tries to hide the pain.
                         
                          HALL MONITOR
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           This is a costume?
                         
                          SHREK
                          (RECOVERING)
           Aaaiyyyy... worked on it all night
           long!
                         
          The Hall Monitor lets his face snap back into place. Shrek
          struggles not to scream in agony. Hall Monitor is still
          suspicious.
                         
                          HALL MONITOR
           Looks pretty real to me.
                         
                          PUSS
           If it were real could I do this?
                         
          Puss's claws snap out one at a time like jack-knives and then
          Puss jabs all the claws deep into Shrek's butt.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Or this?
                         
          Donkey kicks Shrek hard in the groin with his hind legs.
          Shrek winces and sweats.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (UNBELIEVABLY STRAINED)
           He's right! If it were real that
           would have been agonizingly
           painful!
                         
                          DONKEY

          INT. GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Principal Pynchley presides over an assembly for the entire
          student body. He speaks through a megaphone.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           Thank you to Professor Primbottom
           for his invigorating lecture on how
           to just say "nay".
                         
          Two students are standing next to Pynchley. One is dressed
          up like a dragon and the other as a griffin.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           And now, without further ado, let's
           give a warm Worcestershire-hoozah
           to the winner of our "New Mascot"
           contest... the--
                         
          Shrek bursts through the double-doors of the gym.
                         
           PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY (CONT'D)
           --ogre?
                         
          The students gasp as Shrek marches forward.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's right. I'm the new mascot.
           So let's really try and beat the
           other guys... at whatever it is
           they're doing.
                         
          The band plays Smashmouth's "Rock Star."
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           This is indeed all a bit
           unorthodox.
                         
          Without breaking stride, Shrek grabs Principal Pynchley's
          megaphone.
                         
                          SHREK
           Now, where can I find Arthur
           Pendragon?

          The students all point... to the basketball hoop, where Artie
          hangs helplessly. Shrek, Donkey and Puss turn and look up
          and see the freshly wedgied student. The students laugh.
                         
          In the front row, Lancelot bumps fists with Bohort.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           Classic.
                         
          Donkey turns to Lancelot.
                         
                          DONKEY
           You should be ashamed of yourself.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           I didn't do it. They did.
                         
          Lance points to the D&D nerds. They are beside themselves
          with nasal laughter. Nosebleed boy starts bleeding again.
                         
          Shrek reaches up and pulls Artie down to eye level.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Please don't eat me.
                         
                          STUDENTS
                          (CHANTING)
           Eat him! Eat him!
                         
          Even Principal Pynchley gets caught up in the excitement.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           Eat him!
          Shrek yanks on Artie and pulls him off the hoop.
                         
                          SHREK
           I'm not here to eat him.

           toothbrush and jammies. You're the
           new King of Far Far Away.

          The students react with surprise and disbelief.

           Nice one Lance!
                         
          They high five. The tuba player plays a Wha-wha-wha.
                         
                          LANCELOT

                          SHREK
           Absolutely. Now clean out your
           locker, kid. You've got a kingdom
           to run.

           So wait, I'm really the only heir?
                         
          Shrek pauses for just a moment, then...
                         
                          SHREK
           The one and only.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Give me just a second.
                         
          Artie turns back to the crowd and delivers a heartfelt
          speech.
                         
                          ARTIE
           My good people, I think there's a
           lesson here for all of us. Maybe
           the next time you're about to dunk
           a kid's head in a chamber pot,
           you'll stop and think, hey, maybe
           this guy has feelings. Maybe I
           should cut him some slack. Because
           maybe, just maybe... this guy's
           gonna turn out to be, uh...I
           dunno...a King! And maybe his
           first royal decree will be to
           banish everyone who ever picked on
           him -- that's right, I'm looking at
           you, jousting team.
                         
          Artie points and Lancelot and his buddies look horrified.

          Fiona stands at the buffet table, stuffing her face with
          cakes, pies, and anything else she can get her hands on.

           Oooh! It's present time!
                         
          The birds and forest creatures all flock to Snow White. They
          chirp and hoot happily. Snow White looks annoyed.

           Oh, Fiona, won't you please open
           mine first? It's the one in front.
                         
          Fiona reads the card.

           It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume
           that I couldn't exactly not say
           that is or isn't almost partially
           incorrect.

           If that indeed wasn't where he
           isn't. Even if he wasn't not where
           I knew he was could mean that I
           wouldn't completely not know where
           he wasn't.

                          SHREK
           Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are
           one funny kitty cat.
                         
                          PUSS
           What did I say?
                         
                          SHREK
           We don't want Artie here getting
           the wrong idea.
                         
          Shrek motions to Artie, but he's gone. They all look around.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           Uh, Artie?
                         
          The boat suddenly pitches to the right. Shrek braces
          himself. Puss and Donkey tumble away.
                         
                          ALL
           Whoa!
                         
          Artie swings the wheel around, sending the boat back in the
          direction of his school. Shrek works his way into the cabin
          and gains control of the wheel. The drunken Ship Captain
          slides by.
                         
                          SHIP CAPTAIN
           Whoa! Oh, there goes my hip.
                         
                          SHREK
           Artie!
                         
          Shrek turns the wheel the other way.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?!
                         
          The boat veers again, heading back toward Far Far Away.
          Artie falls to the ground and slides to the back of the boat.
                         
          A shuffle board stick slides next to Artie. He grabs it.
                         
                          ARTIE
           What does it look like?!
                         
          He jams it in the boat's wheel. The boat lurches.

          He swings the boat back in the other direction. Shrek rises
          up and grabs the wheel and turns it.
                         
                          SHREK
           This really isn't up to you!
                         
          Artie falls underneath the wheel. He stands up shoving the
          wheel back the other way.
                         
                          ARTIE
           But I don't know anything about
           being King!
                         
                          SHREK
           You'll learn on the job!
                         
          Donkey and Puss roll across the deck.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Whoaaa!
                         
          Shrek grabs the wheel and swings it around. Artie yanks the
          wheel. They wrestle for control.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm
           going back!
                         
                          SHREK
           Back to what? Being a loser?!
                         
          As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone
          too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to
          yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the
          decking.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           Now look what you did!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Look what I did? Who's holding the
           wheel chief?
                         
          Donkey climbs up onto the railing. He is seasick and is
          about to puke when he sees jagged rocks ahead.

           Shrek!
                         
          Shrek desperately sets the wheel back down and tries to steer
          the ship clear of the rocks.

          The camera pans past the boat. Off-screen we hear the boat
          crash into the rocks.
                         
           SHIP CAPTAIN (O.S.)

          EXT. BEACH - DUSK
                         
          Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach.
          He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf. Shrek
          drops Puss and Donkey.
                         
          Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. His fur
          puffs up into a fro. He drops his head in shame.
                         
                          PUSS
           How humiliating...
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, nice going, Your Highness.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Oh, so now it's "Your highness?"
           What happened to "loser?" Huh?
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey, if you think this is getting
           you out of anything, well it isn't.
           We're heading back to Far Far Away
           one way or another, and you're
           gonna be a father!
                         
          Artie raises an eyebrow. Puss and Donkey stare at Shrek
          uncomfortably.
                         
                          ARTIE

                          DONKEY

           A-hem. You just said father...
                         
                          SHREK

          Artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a
          path into the woods.
                         
                          SHREK
           Where do you think you're going?
                         
                          ARTIE

           You get back here young man and I
           mean it!
                         
          Artie keeps climbing.
                         
                          PUSS
           Uh boss, I don't think he's coming
           back and maybe it's for the best.
           He is not exactly king material.
                         
          Shrek looks towards Artie.
                         
                          DONKEY
           When were you planning on telling
           him that you were really supposed
           to be King?
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh c'mon, now why would I do that?
           Besides, he'll be ten times better
           at it than me.
                         
          Shrek starts off after Artie. Donkey jumps in front of Shrek.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then
           you're gonna have to change your
           tactics if you want to get anywhere
           with this kid.

           You're right, Donkey.
                         
          Shrek picks up a piece of driftwood.
                         
                          SHREK
           What about this?
                         
          Donkey shakes his head in disgust.

          Shrek tosses the log.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.
                          (LAUGHS)
           Still...
                         
          Shrek walks off, trying to catch up to Artie.

          Artie marches up the mountain trail.
                         
          Shrek thinks for a moment and then tries a different tactic
          with the kid. He catches up to Artie.
                         
                          SHREK
           Listen Artie...
                         
          Artie looks back over his shoulder. He sees Shrek and just
          keeps going.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           If you think this whole mad scene
           ain't dope, I feel you dude. I
           mean, I'm not trying to get up in
           your grill or raise your roof or
           whatever, but what I am screaming
           is, yo, check out this kazing
           thazing bazaby.
                         
          Puss and Donkey glance at each other. Artie notices a
          cottage in the distance and heads toward it.
                         
                          SHREK
           I mean, if it doesn't groove or
           what I'm saying ain't straight
           trippin', just say, oh no you
           didn't, you know, you're gettin' on
           my last nerve. And then I'll know
           it's... then I'll know it's whack--
                         
          Passing a tree, Artie nonchalantly releases the branch,
          striking Shrek square in the face and takes off running.

          A boiling soup pot sits over a fire in front of a small
          shack. Artie charges though, pounding desperately on the
          door.

          Suddenly, a burst of light shoots through a candle box that
          is hung on the door. A bright, colorful image of an old
          wizard's head is projected out. Donkey is terrified.

          With a "FZZZZT" and a "BLOOP", the image disappears.
                         
          The door opens and a tiny old man, Merlin, comes out.

           purpose.
                         
          Merlin smacks a fly that has landed on his head.
                         
          Shrek and Artie stare in astonishment.
                         
                         
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now, can I interest anyone in a
           snack or beverage?
                         
                          SHREK
           Uh, no.
                         
          Merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Sure you don't wanna try my famous
           rock au-gratin?
                         
          Merlin takes a bite and chews loudly. His gums are bleeding
          from eating rocks.
                         
                          MERLIN
           It's organic!
                         
          They both stare at him uncomfortably.

           directions back to Far Far Away.

                          SHREK
           Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of
           people counting on you so don't try
           and weasel out of it.

           You know what? Why don't you go

           highness to Far Far Away before I
           kick it there.

           Oh, I could tell you. But since
           you're in the midst of self-
           destructive rage spiral it would be
           karmic-ly irresponsible.

                          SHREK
           Yeah, I don't think so.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Look pal, it's either that or some
           primal scream therapy.
           Ahhhhhhhhhh!
                         
          Shrek grabs Merlin's mouth and closes it.
                         
                          SHREK

          A fire blazes.
                         
          Merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire, it flares.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now all of you, look into the "Fire
           of Truth" and tell me what you see!
           Yah! Ha!
           (Wild war cry)
           Woo-looo-looo-looo!
                         
          He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e.
          Rorschach inkblots).
                         
          Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire.

           swirls.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Okay. Monster, go for it.
                         
          Shrek glances at the fire. The stroller from his nightmare
          begins to take shape in the smoke. He blows the image away.
          He covers his fear and changes the subject.
                         
                          SHREK

           This is lame.
                         
          Merlin whacks Artie on the back of the head.
                         
                          ARTIE

           You're lame! Now just go for it.
                         
          He tosses more dirt and flames burst up. Artie studies it.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay. There's a baby bird and a
           father bird sitting in a nest.
                         
          Merlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to
          change as he stays focused.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Wait, the dad just flew away. Why
           did he leave the little bird all
           alone?
                         
          Shrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more
          worked up.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's trying to fly, but it doesn't
           know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!
                         
          Suddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts
          away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him,
          stunned.

           Whoa.
                         
          Merlin goes back inside. They all stare at Artie.

          Donkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie.
          Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists.

          Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are
          For" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device
          drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the
          shack where Merlin peeks out.

          Everyone stares at him.
                         
          He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's
          quiet again.

          Shrek takes this in.

           Well, I doubt he was worse than

                          SHREK
           Oh yeah? My father was an ogre.
           He tried to eat me.
                         
          Artie looks at Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           Now, I guess I should have seen it
           coming. He used to give me a bath
           in barbecue sauce and put me to bed
           with an apple in my mouth.
                         
          Artie chuckles at this.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay... I guess that's... pretty

          Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire.
                         
                          SHREK
           You know, it may be hard to believe
           what with my obvious charm and good
           looks, but people used to think
           that I was a monster. And for a
           long time, I believed them.
                         
          Artie looks up at Shrek.

           you and you just trust who you are.
                         
          Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know, you're okay, Shrek.
                         
          He tosses the stick into the fire.

           Everything's always about you,
           isn't it? It's not like your
           attitude is helping, Snow.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Well maybe it just bothers you that
           I was voted fairest in the land.
                         
                          RAPUNZEL
           You mean in that rigged election?
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Oh, give me a break.

           SNOW WHITE (cont'd)
           "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy
           golden extensions!"
                         
                          QUEEN
           Ladies, let go of your petty
           complaints and let's work together.
                         
          Snow White and Rapunzel share an indignant look.
                         
          Fiona travels deeper into the catacombs. The other
          Princesses follow.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           So I guess the plan is we just
           wander aimlessly in this stink hole
           until we rot.
                         
                          FIONA
           No, we're gonna get inside and find
           out what Charming's up to.
                         
                          DORIS
           I know he's a jerk and everything,
           but I gotta admit, that Charming
           makes me hotter than July.
                         
                          SLEEPING BEAUTY
           Ew!
                         
                          RAPUNZEL
           Ugh.
                         
          Finally, Fiona spots what she was looking for.
                         
                          FIONA
           That's it!
                         
          Fiona, the Queen and the Princesses run towards a long ladder
          and climb up through a grate into the main castle courtyard.
                         
                         
          EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They peer around a corner and see the construction of an
          outdoor theater is underway. Two stagehands walk by carrying
          a large dragon set piece. Evil dwarves are busy painting the
          set. The finishing touches are put on the stage tower.
                         
          The Princesses hug the wall as a group of guards march by.
                         
          Rapunzel takes off in the other direction, and signals the
          Princesses to follow her.

           Come on, this way!
                         
                          FIONA
           Rapunzel. Wait!
                         
          Fiona and the Princesses race after Rapunzel. They spot her
          sprinting into the castle and follow her. They burst through
          the doors and see Prince Charming holding Rapunzel by the
          arm.
                         
                          FIONA
           Charming, let go of her.
                         
          A large group of armed Far Far Away Guards surround them.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles at Fiona.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           But why would I want to do that?
                         
                          RAPUNZEL
           Grrrr!
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Woof!
                         
          He looks back at Rapunzel lovingly, and the two share a long
          kiss. Fiona and the other Princesses are shocked.
                         
                          FIONA
           What?
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Say hello ladies, to the new Queen
           of Far Far Away.
                         
          Cinderella claps excitedly.
                         
                          CINDERELLA
           Yaaaaaaaaay!
                         
          The Princesses stare her down.
                         
                          FIONA
           Rapunzel, how could you?
                         
                          RAPUNZEL
           Jealous much?
                         
          Prince Charming eyes up the Princesses.

                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Soon you'll be back where you
           started... scrubbing floors or
           locked away in towers; that is, if
           I let you last the week.
                         
                          RAPUNZEL
           But Pooky, you promised you
           wouldn't hurt them!
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Not here, "kitten whiskers." Daddy
           will discuss it later. Now forgive
           us, we have a show to put on.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek will be back soon Charming,
           and you'll be sorry.
                         
          He stops and flashes a sadistic smile.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Sorry? Don't you realize --once
           Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away
           he's doomed?
                         
          Prince Charming leads Rapunzel out. She looks back at them
          apologetically. Everyone wears a look of defeat.
                         
          The guards march them off.
                         
          Fiona and the princesses are locked away in a prison cell.
          Fiona looks through the bars of the cell, feeling helpless.

          EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE OF FAR FAR AWAY - DAY
                         
          Shrek startles awake. He sits up and scratches his head,
          looking around. He realizes it's morning.
                         
          Behind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch. Suddenly,
          the tree branch that was holding the bird flicks it off.
                         
          Shrek senses the movement behind him and turns around to find
          everything is normal. He turns back around to wake up
          everyone.
                         
          The trees start to advance toward Shrek.
                         
          The log Artie is sleeping on suddenly sits up, knocking
          Artie, who is still asleep, to the ground.

           Ow!
                         
          The tree turns around to reveal an Evil Tree. Donkey finally
          wakes up.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ahhh!
                         
          The Evil Trees continue to advance. A piano is heard. The
          trees part and Hook is revealed to be playing the piano.
                         
          The music builds to a dramatic finale. Captain Hook turns
          away from his keys and faces them.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Look out! They've got a piano!
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Kill `em all. Except the fat one.
                         
          He stares hard at Shrek and aims his hooked prosthetic.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           King Charming has something special
           in mind for you, ogre.
                         
          Shrek is perplexed.
                         
                          SHREK
           "King Charming?"
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Attack!
                         
          Pirates charge forward, swinging in from the tree branches.
                         
                          PIRATES
           AAAARGH!
                         
          One lands and gets his peg-leg stuck in the ground.
                         
          The pirates close in. Shrek grabs one and throws him to the
          side.
                         
          One pirate raises his sword and prepares to swing at Artie.
                         
                          SHREK
           Artie, Duck!
                         
          Shrek pushes Artie's head down and the sword narrowly misses
          him. The pirate prepares to swing again and Shrek lifts
          Artie above his head.

          Still in the air, Artie uses both legs to kick the pirate to
          the ground. Shrek and Artie share a satisfied look.
                         
          A pirate charges Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ahhh!
                         
          Puss draws his sword and begins fighting off the pirate,
          protecting Donkey.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ha-ha! Argh!
                         
                          PIRATES
           Argh! Argh!
                         
          The camera pans across the back of the piano to reveal Merlin
          happily playing along with Captain Hook. He notices and
          rudely elbows Merlin out of the way.
                         
          A pirate runs at Shrek, only to be tripped by Artie. The
          pirate bounces off Shrek's belly.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ready the plank!
                         
          A wooden board is thrown on a stump, creating a makeshift
          "plank." The pirates back Shrek onto the plank.
                         
          Several pirates with swords force Shrek onto the plank. He
          is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a
          waiting treasure chest below. Several pirates try to shut the
          lid on him.
                         
          Puss, Donkey and Artie are trying to hold off the Villains.
          Suddenly, two Evil Trees come into frame and scoop Puss,
          Donkey and Artie up in a net.
                         
          The pirates aim the cannon at Puss, Donkey and Artie. Artie
          starts to panic. Puss extracts his claws and tries to cut
          through the netting.
                         
          The cannon fuse is lit.
                         
          Shrek bursts open the treasure chest and stands up with the
          chest still stuck to his behind.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Shrek!

           Help!

          Shrek sees the lit fuse and quickly formulates a plan. He
          grabs two pirates and shoves them into the treasure chest.
          He tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and
          catapults himself over to the cannon. At the last second,
          Shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction.
          The cannon fires and hits Captain Hook's piano, blowing it
          into pieces.
                         
          Realizing their defeat, the Evil Trees drop the netting that
          holds Donkey, Puss and Artie. The Evil Trees and Pirates
          take off running.
                         
          Captain Hook turns and sees his army running off. He shakes
          his hook in the air.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ya cowards!
                         
                          SHREK
           What has Charming done with Fiona?
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           She's gonna get what's coming to
           her.
                         
          He raises his hook threateningly but it gets caught on an
          Evil Tree's branch and is dragged away with the rest of the
          Villains.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ahhh.
                          (YELLING BACK)
           And there ain't nothing you can do
           to stop him!
                         
          TIGHT ON SHREK, filled with worry. Nothing else matters to
          him now.
                         
          Artie, Puss, and Donkey run over to Shrek.
                         
                          PUSS
           We've got to save her!
                         
                          DONKEY
           But she's so far far away!
                         
          Shrek thinks for a moment.

           No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've
           got an idea.
                         
                         
          EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Merlin is sitting cross-legged, deep in meditation. Artie
          approaches him.
                         
                          MERLIN

           I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz,
           buzz...
                         
                          ARTIE
           Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to
           get them...I mean, us, back to Far
           Far Away.
                         
          Merlin stops meditating and looks out of the corner of his
          eye at Artie.
                         
                          MERLIN
                          (GETTING UP)
           Forget it. I don't have that kind
           of magic in me anymore, kid. How
           about a hug instead? Hmm? That's
           the best kind of magic.
                         
          Artie tries a new approach.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Mr. Merlin please. I know you can
                          DO IT-
                         
                          MERLIN
           I said, forget it!

                          BUT-
                         
          Merlin turns and starts to walk away muttering under his
          breath.
                         
                          MERLIN (CONT'D)
           Mumble, grumble, interrupt my
           healing. Mumble, mumble.
                         
          Artie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin. Artie starts
          to sob. Merlin stops and turns around.

           Oh. What, what's with you?
                         
          Artie continues to cry.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's just so hard. You know? They
           really need to get back `cause
           their kingdom's in trouble `cause
           there's a really bad man and it's
           just so hard...
                         
          Merlin is visibly uncomfortable.
                         
                          MERLIN
           C'mon, take it easy.
                         
          Artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable.
                         
                          ARTIE
           No! I don't think you understand!
           There's a mean person doing mean
           things to good people-

           Oh, have a heart old man!
                         
          Artie grabs him, now desperate.
                         
                          ARTIE
           And they really need your help to
           get them back! So why won't you
           help them?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oh.
                         
          Artie speaks one last, indecipherable line.
                         
          Merlin is stunned. He doesn't know what to do.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my
           things.
                         
          Merlin goes into his cave. Artie immediately recovers.
          Shrek is impressed.
                         
                          ARTIE

           Well, well, well. You want some
           eggs with that ham?
                         
          Shrek smiles.
                         
          Merlin returns holding a spell book.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now, I am a little rusty, so there
           could be some side effects.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Side effects!?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Don't worry, whatever it is, no
           matter how excruciatingly painful
           it may be, it'll wear off
           eventually... I think.
                         
          Merlin cracks his knuckles. A bolt of lighting shoots out
          his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Oops.
                         
          Donkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Are you sure this is a good idea?
                         
                          SHREK
           Look, if Artie trusts him, that's
           good enough for me. Even if his
           robe doesn't quite cover his-

           get back, um... soon!
                         
          Magic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers. Shrek, Puss,
          Donkey and Artie disappear in a puff of smoke.
                         
                          MERLIN

          They reappear and fall out of the sky and bounce through the
          canopy of a large apple tree. They ping-pong through the
          foliage and land in a heap at the base of the tree.

           teeth?
                         
          Donkey's eyes widen. He realizes his voice is coming out of
          Puss' body.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Oh no!
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) grabs Puss' hat. He looks down at
          Puss' boots. His tail begins to twitch.
                         
                          DONKEY

           sidekick.
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) falls from a tree next to Donkey (in
          Puss' body).

           At least you don't look like some
           kind of bloated roadside piñata.

           Yeah, and you should think about
           getting yourself a pair of pants!
           I feel all exposed and nasty.
                         
          Both Shrek and Artie stare at them. A strained smile pasted
          to their faces. They burst out laughing.
                         
          Donkey joins Puss, both of them scowling.

          Puss is fuming.
                         
          Shrek and Artie regain their composure.

           Don't be! You got us back kid.
                         
          Shrek motions to Far Far Away, just a few miles ahead of
          them. He turns back to Artie.
                         
          Artie smiles.
                         
          Donkey takes a few awkward steps in Puss' body.

          Shrek, Puss (in Donkey's body), and Artie rush past a welcome
          sign to the town that has been boarded over so it now reads
          "Go Go Away."
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) struggles to walk. His tender new
          feet hurt in their tiny boots.

           Woah!
                         
          Inside the kingdom, Rodeo Drive is trashed. There is graffiti
          everywhere.
                         
          Suddenly a carriage driven by Evil Witches comes zooming down
          Rodeo Drive.

          The carriage zips around a corner on two wheels. A drunken
          Evil Dwarf is almost hit by the carriage while crossing the
          street.
                         
          Shrek is shocked by what he sees.
                         
          A crash is heard off-screen.

           What's happened?
                         
                          PINOCCHIO
           Charming and the Villains have
           taken over everything! They
           attacked us but Fiona and the
           Princesses got away. And now she's-
                          -
                         
          The time has run out. The cheesy music stops as the curtain
          goes down.
                         
                          SHREK
           She's what?! She's what!?
                         
          Shrek looks at the marionette theatre and sees how much it
          costs per show.
                         
                          SHREK
           (turns to Puss in Donkey's
                          BODY)
           Puss, loan me five bucks!
                         
                          DONKEY
           C'mon Puss, you heard the man, help
           a brother out.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Do you see any pockets on me?
                         
                          DONKEY

           Hold on a second.
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) removes his boot, he turns it over and
          a bag of money falls onto the ground.

           (in Puss' body)
           Aha!
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) tosses the money to Shrek.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           I had no idea ...really ...I swear.
                         
          Shrek quickly dumps the change into the machine. The music
          starts and the curtain goes up again and Pinocchio dances.
                         
                          SHREK
           Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?
                         
                          PINOCCHIO
           Charming's got her locked away some
           place secret. You gotta find him!
           He's probably getting ready for the
                          SHOWWWW---
                         
          The curtain goes down again.
                         
                          SHREK
           Wait, wait, wait! Pinocchio! What
           show?
                         
          Pinocchio's hand comes out from under the curtain and points
          to a poster on the wall. Puss reads the poster out loud.
                         
                          PUSS
           (reading the poster)
           It's A Happily Ever After, After

                          SHREK
           Shrek's final performance.
                         
          The picture shows Charming, sword raised in the air, with his
          foot pinning Shrek, tongue sticking out of his mouth, to the
          ground.
                         
                          DONKEY
           (in Puss' body)
           Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us
           you were in a play.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well I guess I've been so busy I
           forgot to mention it!

           GUARD #1 (O.S.)
           It's the ogre! Get him!
                         
          Shrek turns and sees a large group of Charming's royal
          knights, armed and ready. They drive them back into the
          alley. Puss (in Donkey's body) steps forward.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Don't worry, Jefe. I got this.
                         
          He whips his head towards the oncoming guards. His eyes are
          large and sweet. His lips pout. The guards are momentarily
          hypnotized by his cuteness, until they realize they're
          staring at a donkey.
                         
          The guards recoil.
                         
                          GUARD #2
           Ugh! Kill it!
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats.
                         
          Artie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps
          forward, confronting the guards.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Look, don't you know who he thinks
           he is? How dare you?
                         
          Shrek picks up on his plan.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey, we're dealing with
           amateurs.
                         
          The guards are confused. Artie tears the poster off the
          wall. Shrek glances at Artie, who steps forward, yanking the
          poster off the wall.
                         
                          ARTIE
           He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so
           sorry about this Mr. Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           I'm gonna lose it!
                         
                          ARTIE
           I assume you have everything ready
           for tonight! You did get the list
           for the dressing room?
                         
          Donkey marches in.

           Yeah, the breakfast croissants
           stuffed with seared sashimi tuna.
           Oh, and please tell me you at least
           have the saffron corn with the
           jalapeno honey butter cause our
           client cannot get into his proper
           emotional state without his
           jalapeno honey butter.

                          GUARD #1
           Uh...Maybe they should talk to
           Nancy in Human Resources.
                         
          Shrek pushes the guards aside and continues on towards the
          castle.
                         
                          PUSS

          The guards look at each other nervously.

          A group of enchanted trees work on through their dance
          number.
                         
          Two dwarfs on bungee chords helplessly swing back and forth
          in the rear of the stage.
                         
          The camera lands on Prince Charming reading his lines next to
          a Shrek stand in.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

                          SCRIPT)
           With this sword, I do- No.
                         
          He starts the line over.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           With this sword, I do smote thee!

          Without looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who
          falls to the ground.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (TO HIMSELF) )
           Is that the right word? "Smote?"
           "Smooote." Is that even a word
           actually? Maybe I should just
           smite him.
                         
          Unseen stage hands drag the stand-in away.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Let's try this again. Now...
                         
                         
          Stagehands shove another stand in onto the stage beside
          Prince Charming.

           Shrek attacks me, I pretend to be
           afraid.
           (he fake screams)
           Ooh!!!
                         
          Prince Charming does a quick mime of being afraid and
          chuckles.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           I say...
           (he riffles through pages)
           "Finally the Kingdom will get the
           happily ever after they deserve,
           die Ogre", blah, blah, blah...
                         
          Without looking he stabs stand in #2. He falls to the ground.
          Prince Charming is still frustrated.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh! It just doesn't feel real
           enough yet!
                         
          He throws the sword to the ground and turns toward the
          dancing villains who are staring at him.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Who told you to stop dancing?!

          He throws the script on the ground and notices the stand-in.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           And what are you laying around for?
           Get up! Honestly.
                         
          Prince Charming storms off.

          Prince Charming storms into his colossal gold leafed dressing
          room, its walls covered with posters of inspirational sayings
          and portraits of Prince Charming in different acting roles.
                         
          Slamming the door, he plops down in his throne chair in front
          of a dressing table and large 3-way mirror. A statuette of
          his mother is on the vanity. He looks at it intently.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Our happily ever after is nearly
           complete, mummy. And I assure you,
           the people of this kingdom will pay
           dearly for every second we've had
           to wait.
                         
                         
                         
          Charming adjusts the mirror, revealing a reflection of Shrek
          standing in the doorway. Artie, Puss and Donkey stand along
          side him.
                         
          Prince Charming quickly stands up and faces Shrek.

          He walks across the room as Prince Charming backs against his
          dressing table.
                         
          Prince Charming fumbles behind his back and pushes a button
          under the counter.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Thank goodness you're here. I was
           beginning to think you might not
           make it back in... time.
                         
          Shrek picks him up by the front of his shirt and scowls.

           Don't worry. She and the others
           are safe. For now.
                         
          Shrek strengthens his grip.
                         
          Suddenly, a group of guards burst into the room and quickly
          surround Shrek, Artie, Puss and Donkey.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Ow.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles.
                         
          Shrek looks around and realizes he's beat. He drops Charming
          with a thud.
                         
          Prince Charming brushes himself off as the guards surround
          Shrek.
                         
          Prince Charming walks over to Artie. A smile grows across
          his face.

           Let me guess... Arthur?
                         
          Artie looks indignant. He raises himself up.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's Artie, actually.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           This boy is supposed to be the new
           King of Far Far Away?
                         
          Laughing, Prince Charming draws his sword and holds it up to
          Artie's neck.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           How pathetic! Now, stand still so I
           won't make a mess.
                         
          Shrek steps in.
                         
                          SHREK
           Charming, stop! I'm here now, you
           got what you wanted. This isn't
           about him.
                         
          Artie is confused.

                          ARTIE
           Then who's it about? I'm supposed
           to be King, right?
                         
          Shrek hesitates and then gathers himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           You weren't really next in line for
           the throne, okay? I was.
                         
                          ARTIE
           But you said the King asked for me
           personally.
                         
                          SHREK
           Not exactly.
                         
                          ARTIE
           What's that supposed to mean?
                         
                         
          Shrek becomes defensive.
                         
                          SHREK
           Look, I said whatever I had to say,
           alright! I wasn't right for the
           job, I just needed some fool to
           replace me, and you fit the bill.
           So just go!
                         
          Artie is stunned.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You were playing me the whole time.
                         
          Shrek fights back tears as he punishes Artie more.
                         
                          SHREK
           You catch on real fast kid... Maybe
           you're not as big of a loser as I
           thought.
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) is about to interject when Donkey (in
          Puss' body) covers his mouth and signals him to stay quiet.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know, for a minute there, I
           actually thought you -
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           What? That he cared about you? He's
           an ogre. What did you expect?

          Prince Charming signals the guards to release Artie. He
          stares at Shrek one last time and heads out.
                         
          Shrek lowers his head in shame.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You really do have a way with
           children, Shrek.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles and the guards lead Shrek off.

          EXT. CASTLE GATE:
                         
          The scene cross-dissolves to Artie's back as he walks away
          from the castle. He gives one last look back, and angrily
          storms away.

          Shrek's ankles and wrists are shackled. Shrek pulls on his
          chains. He sadly looks out the cell window.
                         
                         
          INT. PRISON:
                         
          The scene cross-disolves to another prison window. Fiona
          comes to the window of her prison cell. She stares
          sorrowfully at the castle in the distance.

          the same prison cell.
                         
          Cinderella is frantically scrubbing a spot on the floor to a
          shine.
                         
          Fiona looks out the cell window towards the castle in the
          distance. Behind her, Snow White paces around, complaining.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Had we just stayed put like I
           suggested, we could be sipping tea
           out of little heart-shaped cups...

                          SNOW WHITE
           Eating crumpets smothered with
           loganberries.
                         
                          CINDERELLA
           Yeah... loganberries.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Shut up Cindy.
                         
                          CINDERELLA
           Yeah, shut up.
                         
          Cinderella looks down at her reflection in the floor.
                         
                          CINDERELLA (REFLECTION)
           No! You shut up!
                         
                          CINDERELLA
           Just stay out of this!
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Who cares who's running the kingdom
           anyway?
                         
                          FIONA
           I care.
                         
          Fiona steps forward and challenges them.
                         
                          QUEEN
           And you should all care too.
                         
          Suddenly, the cell door flies open. Donkey and Puss (in each
          other's bodies) are tossed in as the door is slammed behind
          them.
                         
                          PUSS

          Puss, in Donkey's body, hisses and arches his back like a
          cat.

           Puss?!
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Lo siento, Princessa, but I am
           Puss, stuck here inside this
           hideous body.

           I know, I know. Everything's a
           little fruity in the loops right
           now. But what happened is, we went
           to high school, the boat crashed,
           and we got "bippity-bopity-booped"
           by the "Magic Man."

                          SNOW WHITE
           The cat turned into a little horse
           that smells like feet. What's to
           get?
                         
                          SLEEPING BEAUTY

                          DONKEY
           Charming's got him, Princess. And
           he plans on killing Shrek tonight
           in front of the whole kingdom.
                         
          Fiona's lets out a breath.
                         
                          FIONA
           Alright everyone, we need to find a
           way out, now.
                         
          The Princesses nod in agreement.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           You're right.
           (to the other Princesses)
           Ladies, assume the position!
                         
          Sleeping Beauty falls asleep standing up. Snow White quickly
          assumes her position by lying down and puckering her lips.
          Cinderella dusts off a spot, sits down and crosses her legs.

           You have got to be kidding me.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Well, what do you expect us to do?
           We're just four...
                          (NOTICES DORIS)
           I mean, three, super hot
           princesses, two circus freaks, a
           pregnant ogre and an old lady.
                         
          The Queen smiles and then casually walks by the Princesses.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hmmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming
           through.
                         
          She walks right up to the brick wall, takes a deep breath and
          lets out a yell.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hiiiyyyiiiaaaah!
                         
          She head-butts a hole right through the brick wall. Fiona
          and the Princesses are impressed.

           Whoa.

           Mom!?
                         
                          QUEEN
           Well, you didn't actually think you
           got your fighting skills from your
           father, did you?
                         
          Fiona beams at her mother and then turns to the Princesses.
                         
          Snow White points to another wall behind them.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Excuse me, I think there's still
           one more.
                         
          The Queen turns and sees the another wall barring their way.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hmmmm.
                         
          The Queen hurries to the other wall.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hiiiiyah!
                         
          It crumbles, revealing the outside. The princesses wince.
                         
          Fiona approaches her mother.
                         
          The Queen turns around, this time a little woozy, singing
          softly to herself.
                         
                          FIONA
           Why don't you just lie down?

          Snow thinks for a moment and then glances at the other
          Princesses. They nod.
                         
          Snow looks determined. She rips off a sleeve, revealing a
          Dopey tattoo.

           Artie, it's not like it seems.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's not? I think it seems pretty
           clear. He was using me. That's
           all there is to it.
                         
          Artie starts to walk off.

           protect you!
                         
          This stops Artie in his tracks.

          Audience members look at each other in confusion; is this
          crap for real?
                         
          Raul, the make-up artist, cries in the audience.
                         
          From the audience a knight holds up a candle.
                         
          Up in the rafters, Rumplestiltskin cues the Cherubs.

          The Cherubs (Evil Dwarves) are lowered onto the stage by a
          rope and pulley system.
                         
          A spotlight appears on stage. From underneath the stage a
          clamshell rises and opens to reveal Prince Charming on
          horseback.

          clamshell. Prince Charming and his steed, Chauncey, jump out
          of the clamshell.

          There is a loud flash and a loud growling is piped through
          the sound system and flares go off as a trap door opens in
          the stage floor. Prince Charming hams it up for the
          audience, putting his hand to his ear.

          A large, imposing shadow grows onstage. The silhouette
          fades, revealing a shackled Shrek on stage. He pulls at his

          before him.

          A crowd of fans, with "SHREK" written on their stomachs,

          sit down.

          Prince Charming takes a dramatic pause and sings in an ultra-
          high voice of a castrato.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

           Oh boy.
                         
          Prince Charming relishes the moment, pulling out his sword
          and aiming it at Shrek's chest. Prince Charming's voice
          climbs even higher.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You are about to enter

           "FamiliaAAAAAAR!"
                         
          He holds the last, highest note. Shrek winces. Goblets, eye
          glasses, a glass tiara and glass pearls all break in the
          audience.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles. Shrek looks at him with contempt.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well it can't be anymore painful
           than the lousy performance you're
           giving.
                         
          The audience laughs at Shrek's remark. Prince Charming is
          thrown by their reaction.
                         
          From a trap door underneath the stage Rumplestiltskin tries
          to help Prince Charming out by feeding him his next line.

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming gets in Shrek's face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Be quiet!
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on, I'm just havin' fun
           with ya. That's actually a very
           nice leotard.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

           Do they come in men's sizes?
                         
          The audience laughs again.
                         
                          HOOK
           He, he. Now that be funny.
                         
          The crowd laughs again. Shrek smiles, enjoying how he's
          screwing up the show. Prince Charming is furious.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           ENOUGH!
                         
          The crowd falls silent.
                         
          Prince Charming turns back to Shrek.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Now you'll finally know what it's
           like to have everything you've
           worked for, everything that's
           precious to you taken away.
                         
          Prince Charming raises his sword.

           Now you'll know how I felt.
                         
          Suddenly a fireball hits the blade, melting it.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ahhhhh!
                         
          Another huge fireball spreads across the sky as Dragon flies
          above the theater. The Dronkeys follow behind her.

           Sausage Roll!!
                         
          The Three Pigs leap onto the stage, going into a drop and
          roll move to land in between Shrek and Prince Charming. They
          strike a fighting pose.
                         
          Pinocchio comes flying in on his strings, landing with a
          flurry of kung-fu hands.
                         
          The Wolf unzips the wolf costume, steps out and joins the
          others.
                         
                          WOLF

          Gingerbread Man pops up in the tower window, grabs Rapunzel's
          hair and swings down. Before he hits the ground, the end
          catches and he bounces like a bungee jumper. Her hair falls
          into a pile next to a very surprised Gingerbread Man.
                         
          Rapunzel screams. Her mousy brown hair crammed under a hair
          net. She runs off crying.
                         
          Prince Charming looks around, almost surrounded.
                         
          Suddenly a shadow falls over the crowd and they gasp. Dragon
          and the Dronkeys fly in and land on the stage.
                         
          Puss and Donkey leap off her back to the stage.
                         
                          DONKEY

                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           ...Puss!
                         
          He claps his hooves on the stage.
                         
                          DONKEY

          He carves a letter "D" on Pinocchio's bottom.
                         
                          PINOCCHIO

          The Queen head-butts through one of the backdrops, with
          Sleeping Beauty and Doris. Snow White flies in behind them
          with the help of her woodland creatures ("Crouching Tiger,
          Hidden Dragon" style). Cinderella runs on stage equipped with
          a mop as her weapon. Together, the Princesses strike fierce
          poses and stand next to Shrek.
                         
          The audience applauds.
                         
          Suddenly the front door of the "swamp house" set crashes to
          the floor, revealing Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           Hi honey! Sorry we're late. You
           okay?
                         
                          SHREK
           Much better, now that you're here.
                         
                          AUDIENCE
           Awwwwwww!
                         
          The audience applauds. Shrek turns to Prince Charming
          raising his shackled wrists.
                         
                          SHREK
           So Charming, you wanna let me out
           of these so we can settle this ogre
           to man?
                         
          Prince Charming considers this for a second.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oooh, that sounds fun. But I have
           a better idea!
                         
          Prince Charming strikes an imperious pose and claps his
          hands. Cyclops suddenly emerges from the trap door, knocking
          Puss and Donkey down. He approaches them menacingly.
                         
          The witches fly in and threaten the princesses with their
          brooms. The Evil Queen rises up behind the Queen and puts a
          knife to her throat.
                         
          The Evil Dwarves grab The Three Pigs. Gingerbread Man is
          suddenly surrounded by many Evil Knights. He poops out a gum-
          ball.
                         
          Dragon starts to move forward only to find herself surrounded
          by crossbows. A bunch of pirates grab Fiona and tie her up.
                         
                          SHREK

           No! Let go of me!
                         
          Shrek struggles to free himself of the chains, but it's no
          use.
                         
          Prince Charming's eyes narrow.

           Kill it!
                         
          Prince Charming signals to the villains to attack Shrek. As
          the villains advance towards Shrek, a spotlight shines in
          their eyes, stopping them in their tracks.
                         
                          ARTIE

           Artie?
                         
          Artie jumps from the spotlight.
                         
          Artie lands clumsily on a hanging cloud.
                         
          Artie leaps awkwardly from cloud to cloud. The audience
          stares in awe.
                         
          After one last leap, he swings down on the Cherub's cable,
          sending the little person up in the air.
                         
          Artie lands on the stage in between the Villains and Shrek.
          He stands facing the Villains.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Who really thinks we need to settle
           things this way?
                         
          The Evil Knights think about it and raise their hands. The
          other Villains follow suit.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You're telling me you just want to
           be Villains your whole lives?
                         
          This gives the Villains pause.

           But we are Villains. It's the only
           thing we know.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Didn't you ever wish you could be
           something else?
                         
          The Villains aren't convinced.
                         
                          EVIL TREE #2
           Well, it's easy for you to say.
           You're not some evil enchanted
           tree.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You morons! Don't listen to him!
                          ATTACK THEM-
                         
          Another Evil Tree covers Prince Charming's mouth and then
          motions to Artie.
                         
                          EVIL TREE #1
           What Steve's trying to say here is
           that it's hard to come by honest
           work when the whole world's against
           you.
                         
                          EVIL TREE #2
           Right, thanks Ed.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay, fair enough. You're right.
           I'm not a talking tree. But, ya
           know, a good friend of mine once
           told me that just because people
           treat you like a villain, or an
           ogre...
                         
          Artie shares a look with Shrek.
                         
                          ARTIE
           ... or just some loser...
                         
          The Fairy-tale Villains listen intently.
                         
                          ARTIE (CONT'D)
           ...it doesn't mean you are one.
                         
          The Evil Tree tightens his grip as Prince Charming struggles
          to break free.

           The thing that matters most is what
           you think of yourself.
                         
          Artie commands the stage.
                         
                          ARTIE (CONT'D)
           If there's something you really
           want, or there's someone you really
           want to be, then the only person
           standing in your way ...is you.
                         
          Artie points at Rumplestiltskin directly in front of him.
          Rumplestiltskin is alarmed.
                         
                          RUMPLESTILTSKIN
           Me?

                          ARTIE
           No, no, no! What I mean is: each
           of you is standing in your own way!
                         
                          VILLAINS
           Oooooooh!
                         
          The Headless Horseman breaks through the crowd.
                         
                          HEADLESS HORSEMAN
           I've always wanted to play the
           flute.
                         
          The Fairy-tale Villains and Creatures look at each other.
          The Evil Queen steps up.
                         
                          EVIL QUEEN
           I`d like to open up a spa in
           France.
                         
          The Villains nod in agreement.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           I grow daffodils!
                         
          Complete silence as everyone stares at Hook.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           And they're beautiful!
                         
          Captain Hook looks thoughtfully at his sword, then throws it
          down.

          The pirates throw theirs down, followed by the witches and
          Evil Knights. The evil knight holding Pinocchio is thinking
          about it when Pinocchio reaches over and takes the ax from
          him. The weapons pile up in the middle of the stage. Everyone
          else cheers and starts to mingle, introducing themselves and
          shaking hands.
                         
          Gingerbread Man high fives with an Evil Knight. Fiona is
          untied.
                         
          Mabel walks up to Doris and lightly punches her on the jaw.
          Doris returns the sign of affection by punching Mabel in the
          jaw, but a bit too hard, sending her falling to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, Prince Charming kicks himself free of the Evil Tree
          and charges them. He grabs a sword from the discard pile and
          raises it up, his aim set at Artie.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Aaaahhhh!
                         
          Despite his fear, Artie faces Prince Charming bravely. As
          Prince Charming charges, Shrek finds the strength to break
          his chains. Just before Prince Charming strikes, a chain
          whips into frame, wrapping around the sword. Shrek pulls
          Prince Charming around in a circle, away from Artie. Furious,
          he charges Shrek and stabs him with the sword. Charming lets
          go and Shrek stumbles back with the weapon impaled in him,
          and falls to the floor, groaning.
                         
          Prince Charming beams, and laughs. He turns to the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           A new era finally begins!
                         
          The audience cowers.
                         
          Shrek looks up smiling and nods at Fiona and Artie.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Now, all of you, bow before your
           king!
                         
          Shrek casually rises up behind him and clears his throat.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah-hem.
                         
          Charming turns around. Shrek lifts his arm revealing that he
          was never really stabbed.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)

          Charming is stunned.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           This was supposed to be my happily
           ever after.
                         
          Prince Charming is paralyzed. Shrek drops the sword and grabs
          him by the shirt-front, lifting him off of his feet.
                         
          He winces, but is still defiant.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well I guess you need to keep
           looking...
                         
          Shrek looks at Fiona and at his friends and smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           ...cause I'm not giving up mine.
                         
          Shrek sets Prince Charming down and signals DRAGON. She
          casually tips the tower over with her tail. A shadow falls
          over Prince Charming. He turns and sees the tower falling
          toward him, his body perfectly framed up in the princesses's
          window.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Mommy?
                         
          It crashes down and he's trapped inside.
                         
          As the dust clears, the crown rolls across the stage. Artie
          stops it with his foot and slowly picks it up.
                         
                          SHREK
           It's yours if you want it, you
           know, but this time it's your
           choice.
                         
          Artie considers it.
                         
          He looks at Shrek, who is smiling proudly at him.
                         
          Artie turns to the audience and holds out the crown to them.
          They cheer him.
                         
          Artie places the crown on his head. The crowd goes nuts. In
          the audience, Raul sobs with joy.
                         
                          ALL
           Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Ar-tie!

          Everybody cheers as the Fairy-tale Creatures and Villains put
          Artie up on their shoulders and carry him off. Donkey and
          Puss, still in each other's bodies, watch as Artie gets
          carried away.
                         
          In a puff of smoke, Merlin suddenly appears. He looks around
          confused, clutching his show ticket.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, excuse me, that's my seat.
                         
          Suddenly he is thrown back against the front of the stage as
          Donkey and Puss confront him.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Okay, senor hocus-y pocus-y. The
           time has come to rectify some
           wrongs!

                          MERLIN
           Uh... alright, alright...look..
                         
          Merlin rubs his hands together.
                         
                          MERLIN
           You're gonna feel a little pinch,
           and possibly some lower intestinal
           discomfort, but this should do the
           trick.
                         
          Merlin rolls up his sleeves, and prepares to make with the
          magic. He lets loose with a bright burst of magic. It takes a
          moment for Donkey and Puss to recover. They eye each other
          cautiously.
                         
                          PUSS
           Are you..?
                         
          Donkey lifts his hoof and inspects it carefully.

                          PUSS
           And I am not you!
                         
          Donkey and Puss give each other a big hug.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Alright!
                         
          The two of them turn and walk away together.
                         
          Merlin is behind them, smoking fingers and all. Suddenly his
          eyes grow wide.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oops. Ah, never mind.
                         
          We see that Donkey still has Puss' tail and Puss had
          Donkey's. Merlin slips away.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona watch Artie in the distance.

          Shrek smiles, and touches Fiona's belly.

          They kiss.
                         
          The camera pulls back to see everyone celebrating around
          Shrek and Fiona as they kiss.

          Shrek grabs a "gourd" bottle and creates an ogre shake out of
          slug juice, eye balls and worms. He walk over to join Fiona
          by the fire.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah, finally.
                         
          Shrek gives Fiona the "gourd" bottle and she places a nipple
          on it. Two ogre babies crawl up onto Fiona's lap.
                         
                          OGRE BABIES
           Da da.
                         
          A third ogre baby appears at Shrek's feet. He bends down to
          pick him up.
                         
          One big happy family of five. Shrek laughs and gives the
          babies and Fiona a hug.
                         
          The front door opens up to reveal Puss and Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Hey! I smell Shrek Jr.
                         
          The Dronkeys come swarming in behind Donkey. Dragon peers in
          through the door.
                         
          Shrek with a safety pin in his mouth is doing his best at
          changing diapers. He twists the diaper around and the baby
          goes flying off screen and lands in a diaper that Fiona is
          holding. She smiles at Shrek.
                         
          The swamp house is overrun with Dronkeys, ogre babies and
          dirty diapers.
                         
          Puss sits next to an ogre baby that has a pacifier in his
          mouth. He takes the pacifier out of his mouth, shoves it in
          Puss' mouth and gives Puss a big hug. Another baby comes
          crawling into frame and starts to tug on Puss' tail. A tug
          of war ensues.
                         
          The ogre babies are bathing in a pot of water (a la a beat
          from the Nightmare scene). One of the babies farts in the
          water as Shrek comes in and scoops them up. Shrek laughs.

          A baby ogre pulls ear wax from Shrek's ear. The baby uses
          the wax to draw squiggly lines on a piece of paper.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy boy.
                         
          The Queen is bouncing a baby ogre on her lap. The baby pukes
          and the Queen smiles.
                         
          There is a knock at the door. Donkey is laying on the floor
          holding a bottle with all four hooves, drinking the milk.
                         
          Shrek grabs the bottle out of Donkey's mouth.

          baby and Shrek holds up an unhappy, diapered Puss.

          her foot and puts the gourd in the baby's mouth.
                         
          Shrek is burping a baby over his shoulder. The baby burps.
          Fiona has a baby over her shoulder and the baby burps. A
          Dronkey sitting on a chair does a flame-belch and an ogre
          baby crawling by farts which causes a flame thrower effect
          into the fireplace.

                                  SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA

               Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND 
               comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes 
               some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work.

               He climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked 
               far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car 
               starts fitfully.

               As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot.

               INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

               He cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his 
               hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just 
               anguish. He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and 
               soon NODS OFF.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The door bursts open. Miles runs into the kitchen, looking 
               just past camera.

                                     MILES
                         Fuck!

               WHIP PAN TO --

               THE MICROWAVE CLOCK that reads 10:50.

               ON THE PHONE --

               Miles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there 
                         by noon, but there's been all this 
                         work going on at my building, and 
                         it's like a total nightmare, and I 
                         had a bunch of stuff to deal with 
                         this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm 
                         out the door right this second. It's 
                         going to be great. Yeah. Bye.

               INT. MILES'S BATHROOM - DAY

               ON THE TOILET --

               Miles has a BOOK propped open on his knees. He turns a page, 
               lost in his reading.

               LATER --

               Miles SHOWERS.

               IN THE MIRROR --

               Miles FLOSSES.

               INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

               Miles finally makes it to the front of the line.

                                     BARISTA
                         Hey, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please.

                                     BARISTA
                         Rough night, huh?
                              (ringing it up)
                         For here?

                                     MILES
                         No, I'm running late. Make it to go. 
                         And give me a New York Times and...
                              (scanning the display 
                              case)
                         ...a spinach croissant.

               EXT. 5 FREEWAY ENTRANCE RAMP - DAY

               Miles's Saab chugs up the ramp and merges.

               INSERT - NEW YORK TIMES CROSSWORD PUZZLE --

               -- pressed against the STEERING WHEEL. The puzzle is about 
               1/3 finished.

               EXT. 5 FREEWAY - DAY

               As though from an adjacent car, we see Miles driving while 
               carefully filling in an answer.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

               A SIGN reads:

                                   RANCHO PALOS VERDES
                                   PALOS VERDES ESTATES
                                         1/4 MILE

               PAN TO MILES as he signals to change lanes. The finished 
               puzzle lies on the passenger seat.

               EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY

               The houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many 
               affluent Southern California suburbs.

               Miles's car pull into the driveway behind an older BMW and 
               two LEXI. He gets out and trots toward the front door.

               INT. ERGANIAN HOUSE - DAY

               A GIANT PROJECTION TV --

               In a large split-level living room displays a GOLF TOURNAMENT.

               WIDE --

               Watching from the ultra-comfortable furniture are MIKE 
               ERGANIAN, a tanned, silver-haired real estate caudillo; bride-
               to-be CHRISTINE ERGANIAN, his oldest daughter; and JACK 
               LOPATE, wearing bowling shirt, shorts and flip-flops.

               MRS. ERGANIAN, a warm and elegant housewife, shows Miles 
               into the room.

                                     MRS. ERGANIAN
                         Look what the cat dragged!

                                     MILES
                         Hi, everybody.

               Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with 
               Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine 
               irritation.

                                     JACK
                         About time you got here, bud. Mr. 
                         Prompt.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         We were thinking maybe you took the 
                         wrong way and went to Tijuana and 
                         they didn't let you back in.

               The Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too.

                                     MILES
                         I had to bribe them.

               More lame laughter.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Hey, Miles.

                                     MILES
                              (leaning in to kiss 
                              Christine)
                         Seriously though, the freeway was 
                         unbelievable today. Unbelievable. 
                         Bumper to bumper the whole way. People 
                         getting an early start on the weekend, 
                         I guess. Granted I got a late start, 
                         but still.

               Although Mr. Erganian presses MUTE on the remote, he keeps 
               watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles.

                                     MRS. ERGANIAN
                         Christine, why don't you ask Miles 
                         about the cake?

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to 
                         the kitchen with me.

                                     JACK
                         Don't bother him with that. We got 
                         to get going.

                                     CHRISTINE
                              (taking Miles's hand)
                         It'll just take a second.

               INT. ERGANIAN KITCHEN - DAY

               Jack and the Erganians surround Miles as he eats from a plate 
               with two pieces of CAKE -- one white, one dark.

                                     MRS. ERGANIAN
                         Jack tells us you are publishing a 
                         book. Congratulations.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         Yes, congratulations.

               Miles shoots Jack a look. Mr. Erganian gets some ice cubes 
               from the refrigerator door.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized 
                         yet, but, um, there has been some 
                         interest and --

                                     MRS. ERGANIAN
                              (to Jack)
                         Your friend is modest.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest. 
                         Indulge them. Don't make me out to 
                         be a liar.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         What subject is your book? Non-
                         fiction?

                                     MILES
                         No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although 
                         there's a lot from my own life, so I 
                         guess technically some of it is non-
                         fiction.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         Good, I like non-fiction. There is 
                         so much to know about the world that 
                         I think reading a story someone just 
                         invented is kind of a waste of time.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         So which one do you like better?

                                     MILES
                         I like them both, but if pressed I'd 
                         have to say I prefer the dark.

                                     JACK
                              (to Christine)
                         See?

               INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

               IN A REAR VIEW MIRROR --

               The Erganians wave good-bye.

               INSIDE THE CAR --

               Miles accelerates as he and Jack wave back.

                                     JACK
                         Where the fuck were you, man? I was 
                         dying in there. We were supposed to 
                         be a hundred miles away by now.

                                     MILES
                         I can't help the traffic.

                                     JACK
                         Come on. You're fucking hungover.

                                     MILES
                         Okay, there was a tasting last night. 
                         But I wanted to get us some stuff 
                         for the ride up. Check out the box.

               Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD 
               WINE BOX.

                                     MILES
                         Why did you tell them my book was 
                         being published?

                                     JACK
                         You said you had it all lined up.

                                     MILES
                         No, I didn't. What I said was that 
                         my agent had heard there was some 
                         interest at Conundrum...

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, Conundrum.

                                     MILES
                         ...and that one of the editors was 
                         passing it up to a senior editor. 
                         She was supposed to hear something 
                         this week, but now it's next week, 
                         and... It's always like this. It's 
                         always a fucking waiting game. I've 
                         been through it too many times 
                         already.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds 
                         like you're in to me.

                                     MILES
                         It's a long shot, all right? And 
                         Conundrum is just a small specialty 
                         press anyway. I'm not getting my 
                         hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's 
                         it. I've stopped caring.

               Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE 
               and TWO GLASSES.

                                     JACK
                         But I know it's going to happen this 
                         time. I can feel it. This is the 
                         one. I'm proud of you, man. You're 
                         the smartest guy I know.

               Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle.

                                     MILES
                         Don't open that now. It's warm.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, we're celebrating. I say we 
                         pop it.

                                     MILES
                         That's a 1992 Byron. It's really 
                         rare. Don't open it now. I've been 
                         saving it!

               Jack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a 
               fountain of champagne erupts.

                                     MILES
                         For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just 
                         wasted like half of it!

               Jack begins pouring two glasses.

                                     JACK
                         Shut up.
                              (handing Miles a glass)
                         Here's to a great week.

                                     MILES
                              (coming around)
                         Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass 
                         behavior, I'm really glad we're 
                         finally getting this time together.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah.

                                     MILES
                         You know how long I've been begging 
                         to take you on the wine tour. I was 
                         beginning to think it was never going 
                         to happen.

               They clink and drink.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, that's tasty.

                                     MILES
                         100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. 
                         They don't even make it anymore.

                                     JACK
                         Pinot Noir? How come it's white? 
                         Doesn't noir mean dark?

                                     MILES
                         Jesus. Don't ask questions like that 
                         up in the wine country. They'll think 
                         you're a moron.

                                     JACK
                         Just tell me.

                                     MILES
                         Color in the red wines comes from 
                         the skins. This juice is free run, 
                         so there's no skin contact in the 
                         fermentation, ergo no color.

                                     JACK
                              (not really listening)
                         Sure is tasty.

               EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

               The Saab heads north.

               INT. SAAB - DAY

               The boys continue to drink and drive.

                                     MILES
                         Did you read the latest draft, by 
                         the way?

                                     JACK
                         Oh, yeah. Yeah.

                                     MILES
                         And?

                                     JACK
                         I liked it a lot. A lot of 
                         improvements. It just seemed overall, 
                         I don't know, tighter, more... 
                         congealed or something.

                                     MILES
                         How about the new ending? Did you 
                         like that?

                                     JACK
                         Oh yeah. Much better.

                                     MILES
                         There is no new ending. Page 750 on 
                         is exactly the same.

                                     JACK
                         Well, then I guess it must have felt 
                         new because everything leading up to 
                         it was so different.

               INT. GAS STATION #1 - DAY

               Miles is pumping gas. Jack is stretching his legs nearby or 
               perhaps cleaning the windshield.

               A CELLPHONE RINGS. Jack reaches into his pocket.

                                     JACK
                              (looking at the phone)
                         It's Christine.
                              (snapping it open)
                         Hey you.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON PHONE)
                         You guys having fun?

               Christine's voice is so loud that Jack has to hold the phone 
               away from his ear.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have 
                         been a blast.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Good. That's good.

               A silence, then --

                                     JACK
                         So what's up?

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Just seeing how you're doing. And, 
                         um, Mom and I were starting to look 
                         over the seating charts again, and 
                         we're wondering if you wanted Tony 
                         Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, 
                         or should he be at one of the singles 
                         tables?

               Jack looks at Miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         So what do you think? With the 
                         Feldmans?

               Jack hasn't even really heard the question.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. The Feldmans.

               As the conversation continues, Miles replaces the GAS PUMP, 
               screws the GAS CAP back on, and together the guys get back 
               into the car. We DRIVE AWAY WITH THEM.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Really? Because I don't know, I was 
                         thinking that --

                                     JACK
                         Well, then put him at the singles 
                         table.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         The problem with that is that then 
                         there's one extra --

                                     JACK
                         Then put him with the Feldmans. 
                         Whatever you and your Mom decide is 
                         fine with me.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to 
                         include you in this decision. He's 
                         your friend.

                                     JACK
                         I didn't dismiss you. I told you 
                         what I thought, but it didn't seem 
                         to matter, so you decide. Besides, 
                         this is supposed to be my time with 
                         Miles. I hope you're not going to 
                         call every five minutes.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         I'm not going to call every five 
                         minutes, but this is important.

                                     JACK
                         Honey, I'm just saying you know I 
                         need a little space before the 
                         wedding. Isn't that the point of 
                         this? Isn't that what we talked about 
                         with Dr. Gertler?

               A silence. Then --

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Why are you being so defensive?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know, Christine. Perhaps 
                         it's because I feel attacked.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         I ask you one simple question, and 
                         suddenly I'm attacking you.

                                     JACK
                         Listen. I'll call you when we get 
                         there, and we can talk about it then, 
                         okay?

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Bye.

                                     JACK
                         I love you.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Bye.

               Jack SLAMS his cellphone shut, momentarily blinded with rage.

                                     MILES
                         Tony Levin? Why did you fucking invite 
                         Tony Levin?

               EXT. 405 FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Saab heads north -- now passing through LOS ANGELES.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - LATE AFTERNOON

               Miles signals and begins to head for an EXIT.

                                     JACK
                         Whoa, why are we getting off?

                                     MILES
                         I've just got to make one quick stop. 
                         Won't take a second.  

                                     JACK
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         I thought we could just say a quick 
                         hello to my mother.

                                     JACK
                         Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were 
                         supposed to be up there hours ago.

                                     MILES
                         It's her birthday tomorrow. And I 
                         don't feel right driving by her house 
                         and not stopping in, okay? It'll 
                         just take a second. She's right off 
                         the freeway.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Saab takes an EXIT.

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         How old's she going to be?

                                     MILES (O.S.)
                         Um... seventy... something.

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         That's a good age.

               OMIT.

               OMIT. 

               EXT. CONDO COMMUNITY STREET - DUSK

               The Saab rounds a corner and parks in front of a modest CONDO.

               SUPERIMPOSE:

                                    OXNARD, CALIFORNIA

               EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - DUSK

               Approaching the front door, Miles pulls a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS 
               out of a plastic grocery store bag. Jack carries a bottle of 
               CHAMPAGNE.

               Miles pulls a BIRTHDAY CARD out of the bag too.

                                     MILES
                         Wait a second.

               He pulls a PEN from his pocket and signs it. As he licks the 
               envelope, Jack rings the bell.

               Moments later PHYLLIS comes to the door. She is a matronly 
               older woman in a nightgown and housecoat.

                                     MILES AND JACK
                         Surprise! Happy Birthday!

               The boys offer up the flowers and champagne. Phyllis slurs 
               slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating 
               of her own.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         My God. Miles. And Jack! What a 
                         surprise. I can't remember the last 
                         time you brought me flowers.

               They hug.

                                     JACK
                         They're from both of us.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         A famous actor bringing me flowers 
                         on my birthday. Don't I feel special?

                                     MILES
                         A famous actor who's getting married 
                         next week.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I 
                         hope that girls knows how lucky she 
                         is, marrying no less than Derek 
                         Summersby.

               The boys follow her inside.

               INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

                                     JACK
                         Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven 
                         years ago.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Well, you were wonderful on that 
                         show. I never understood why they 
                         had to give you that brain tumor so 
                         soon. Why that didn't make you the 
                         biggest movie star in the world is a 
                         sin. It's a sin.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, well, you should be my agent.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         If I was, I would sing your praises 
                         up and down the street until they 
                         put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, 
                         why didn't you tell me you were coming 
                         and bringing this handsome man? Look 
                         how I'm dressed. I've got to run and 
                         put my face on.  

                                     JACK
                         You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (over her shoulder)
                         Oh, stop it. Make yourselves 
                         comfortable.
                              (now around the corner)
                         You boys hungry?

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I'm hungry.

               Jack gives Miles a look.

                                     MILES
                              (low)
                         Just a snack. Calm down.

               Miles leads Jack into this small condo. The TV is on, and 
               it's MESSY. Amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes, an 
               AB-ROLLER and an ancient SCHWINN EXER-CYCLE sit forgotten in 
               a corner.

               INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Miles finishes twisting ice trays into a MOP BUCKET as it 
               fills with water in the sink. He puts the champagne in and 
               carries it into the --

               INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               He takes a seat on the sofa next to Jack, who is watching 
               WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?

                                     MILES
                         Let me show you something. The secret 
                         to opening champagne is that once 
                         the cork is released, you keep 
                         pressure on it so you don't --

                                     JACK
                              (concentrated on the 
                              TV)
                         Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.

               Miles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence.

                                     PHYLLIS (O.S.)
                         Ready for my close up!

               The boys turn to see Phyllis now dolled up in thick make-up 
               and a PANTSUIT. Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed. 
               Overall she looks much worse than before.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you 
                         bring that out onto the lanai? I 
                         thought we could eat on the lanai.

               EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT

               Miles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular 
               glass table. They are mid-meal.

               Everyone is more than a little lubricated, especially the 
               birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another 
               plate of food.

                                     JACK
                         Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. 
                         Absolutely delicious.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (sitting)
                         They're just leftovers.

                                     JACK
                         Is it chicken?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I could have made something fancier 
                         if a certain someone had let me know 
                         that a certain someone was coming 
                         for a visit with a certain special 
                         friend. Could have made a pork roast.

                                     MILES
                         It was a surprise, Mom.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And I could have already put clean 
                         sheets on the other bed and the fold-
                         out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and 
                         the twins are picking us up at 11:30 
                         to go to brunch at the Sheraton. 
                         They do a magnificent job there. 
                         Wendy is so excited you're coming.

               Silence. Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth.

                                     MILES
                         You talked to Wendy?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Just now. She's thrilled. And the 
                         kids.

                                     MILES
                              (trying to be chipper)
                         Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty 
                         eager to get up to... you know, but, 
                         uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Well, you boys do what you want. I 
                         just think it would be nice for us 
                         to be together as a family on my 
                         birthday.

                                     MILES
                         Uh-huh.
                              (wiping his mouth)
                         I'll be right back.

               He gets up and heads into the house.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Miles heads toward...

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...and goes directly to her dresser, opening a drawer filled 
               with bras, panties and stockings.

               He burrows through his mother's lingerie until locating a 
               CAN OF RAID. A can of Raid?

               He twists open the bottom and pulls it apart, revealing it 
               to be a SECRET STASH for valuables disguised as a common 
               household product. Inside are stacks of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR 
               BILLS.

                                     MILES
                              (quickly peeling some 
                              off)
                         ...six, seven, eight,...
                              (one more for good 
                              luck)
                         Nine.

               His task complete, he closes the drawer, and as he stuffs 
               the bills in his pocket, his glance falls upon FRAMED PHOTOS 
               atop the dresser --

               -- A proud NINE-YEAR-OLD MILES poses in front of his childhood 
               San Diego home, showing off a WAGON filled with freshly 
               harvested lettuce. On the wagon is a hand-lettered sign --
               "10 cents a bunch."

               -- A Sears portrait shows the RAYMOND FAMILY: a much younger 
               Phyllis, her husband, and their two children -- a 12-year-
               old Miles and seven-year-old Wendy.

               -- Miles at his wedding. He and his bride VICTORIA look young 
               and attractive, their faces radiant and hopeful.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Miles enters, flushes the toilet and leaves.

               EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT

               As Miles slides open the door and takes his seat again, Jack 
               is pouring Phyllis another glass.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And what was that other one you did, 
                         the one where you're the jogger?

                                     JACK
                         Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That 
                         was for Spray and Wash.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Spray and Wash. That's the one.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, I remember the girl who was in 
                         it with me. She was something.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I just remember you jogging. So when's 
                         the wedding?

                                     MILES
                              (irritated)
                         This Saturday, Mom, remember? We 
                         told you.

                                     JACK
                         And Miles is my best man, Mrs. 
                         Raymond. My main man.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (another drink of 
                              wine)
                         Miles, when are you going to get 
                         married again?

                                     MILES
                         I just got divorced. Phyllis.

                                     JACK
                         Two years ago, buddy.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You should get back together with 
                         Victoria. She was good for you.

               Embarrassed for his friend, Jack just stares at his food.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         She was good for you.
                              (turning to Jack)
                         And so beautiful and intelligent. 
                         You knew her, right?

                                     JACK
                         Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you 
                         need some money?

                                     MILES
                         I'm fine.

               Miles takes another drink of wine.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               UNDER BLACK, a CARD --

                                          SUNDAY

                                     MILES (O.S.)
                         Jack. Jack.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY

               Jack finally awakens with a start and finds Miles standing 
               above him, shaking him.

               WIDE --

               As Jack gets up, we see he has crashed on Phyllis's bed 
               adorned with all her decorative PILLOWS.

               INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies 
               sprawled and snoring on the sofa. On the TV, ostensibly never 
               turned off the night before, is an inane CARTOON.

               As Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward 
               the TV to turn it off. Miles waves him off.

                                     MILES
                              (a loud whisper)
                         She'll wake up.

               As they leave and Miles closes the front door quietly behind 
               him, we PAN to the flowers still wrapped and forgotten on a 
               side table.

               INT. ROADSIDE IHOP - DAY

               TWO PLATES OF FOOD float in front of two breasts tucked inside 
               a zippered uniform.

               WIDER --

               Disheveled and unshaven, Jack and Miles are served breakfast 
               by a young, innocently sexy WAITRESS. Jack leers after her.

                                     JACK
                         Fuck, man. Too early in the morning 
                         for that, you know what I mean?

                                     MILES
                         She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look 
                         at that stuff anymore.

                                     JACK
                         That's your problem, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         As if she'd even be attracted to 
                         guys like us in the first place.

                                     JACK
                         Speak for yourself. I get chicks 
                         looking at me all the time. All ages.

                                     MILES
                         It's not worth it. You pay too big a 
                         price. It's never free.

               They eat in silence a moment.

                                     JACK
                         You need to get laid.

               Miles shrugs off the comment.

                                     JACK
                         It'd be the best thing for you. You 
                         know what? I'm going to get you laid 
                         this week. That's going to be my 
                         best man gift to you. I'm not going 
                         to give you a pen knife or a gift 
                         certificate or any of that other 
                         horseshit.

                                     MILES
                         I'd rather have a knife.

                                     JACK
                         No. No. You've been officially 
                         depressed for like two years now, 
                         and you were always a negative guy 
                         anyway, even in college. Now it's 
                         worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching 
                         English to fucking eighth-graders 
                         when they should be reading what you 
                         wrote. Your books.

                                     MILES
                         I'm working on it.

               Miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns

                                     JACK
                         You still seeing that shrink?

                                     MILES
                         I went on Monday. But I spent most 
                         of the time helping him with his 
                         computer.

                                     JACK
                         Well, I say fuck therapy and what's 
                         that stuff you take, Xanax?

                                     MILES
                         And Lexapro, yes.

                                     JACK
                         Well, I say fuck that. You need to 
                         get your joint worked on, that's 
                         what you need.

                                     MILES
                         Jack. This week is not about me. 
                         It's about you. I'm going to show 
                         you a good time. We're going to drink 
                         a lot of good wine, play some golf, 
                         eat some great food, enjoy the scenery 
                         and send you off in style.

                                     JACK
                         And get your bone smooched.

               Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions 
               for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be 
               right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to 
               signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching 
               him.

                                     JACK
                         What?

               EXT. CENTRAL COAST - DAY

               In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN --
               makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that 
               those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize.

               MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the 
               rhythm of a road trip.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               The car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward 
               Buellton. Miles and Jack must SHOUT to be heard in the open 
               car.

                                     MILES
                         You know what? Let's take the Santa 
                         Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.

                                     JACK
                         Whatever's closest, man. I need a 
                         glass.

                                     MILES
                         These guys make top-notch Pinot and 
                         Chardonnay. One of the best producers 
                         in Santa Barbara county.
                              (looking out the window)
                         Look how beautiful this view is. 
                         What a day!

                                     JACK
                         I thought you hated Chardonnay.

                                     MILES
                         I like all varietals. I just don't 
                         generally like the way they manipulate 
                         Chardonnay in California -- too much 
                         oak and secondary malolactic 
                         fermentation.

               EXT. SANTA ROSA TURN-OFF - DAY

               The Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.

                                     MILES
                         Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous? 
                         And the ocean's just right over that 
                         ridge. See, the reason this region's 
                         great for Pinot is that the cold air 
                         off the Pacific flows in at night 
                         through these transverse valleys and 
                         cools down the berries. Pinot's a 
                         very thin-skinned grape and doesn't 
                         like heat or humidity.

               Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and 
               articulateness.

               The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long 
               gravel DRIVEWAY.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel 
                         sells.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks, Jack. So do I.
                              (noticing)
                         Here we are.

               EXT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY

               Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. As they 
               get out and walk --

                                     MILES
                         So what'd you guys finally decide on 
                         for the menu?

                                     JACK
                         I told you. Filet and salmon.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, but how are they making the 
                         salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill 
                         sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always 
                         have white wine with fish?

                                     MILES
                         Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we 
                         have to find out because it's going 
                         to make a big difference.

                                     JACK
                              (taking out his phone)
                         Let me call Christine.

                                     MILES
                         Doesn't have to be now. Let's go 
                         taste.

                                     JACK
                         I owe her a call anyway.

               Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room 
               as Jack SPEED DIALS.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, honey. So we're up here about 
                         to taste some whites, and we need to 
                         know how the caterers are going to 
                         make the salmon.

               Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.

                                     JACK
                         No, I know, I didn't forget, but we 
                         wound up at Miles's mom's house, and 
                         it got really late, and it was hard 
                         to call, so I'm calling you now. I 
                         said I was sorry. Yes, I did.
                              (to Miles)
                         You heard me say I was sorry, right?

               Miles just shrugs.

                                     JACK
                         Miles heard me say I was sorry.

               As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he 
               wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of 
               earshot.

                                     JACK
                         Give me a break, will you? I just 
                         called to find out about the salmon -- 
                         for our wedding -- to be more 
                         involved, like you said -- and all 
                         you want to do is get into it about 
                         last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm 
                         sorry I didn't call. You're totally 
                         right. I know, but I'm trying to 
                         make this the best wedding I can 
                         with the best wine we can find. Don't 
                         I get any credit for that? Okay. 
                         Look, I've got to go. I'm out here 
                         in the parking lot, and Miles is 
                         waiting for me...

               And so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling. Miles decides 
               to head inside.

               INT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY

               Miles is at the bar, TWO GLASSES in front of him. Jack walks 
               in and bellies up next to him.

                                     JACK
                              (proudly)
                         Baked with a butter-lime glaze.

                                     MILES
                         Now we're talking.

               CHRIS BURROUGHS, a POURER in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes 
               over.

                                     CHRIS
                         This is the condemned man?

                                     MILES
                         Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack.

               Chris and Jack shake hands.

                                     JACK
                         How you doing?

                                     CHRIS
                         You guys want to start with the Vin 
                         Gris?

                                     JACK
                         Sounds good.

               TWO GLASSES are filled with small amounts of PINOT NOIR VIN 
               GRIS.

                                     JACK
                         This is rose, right?

                                     MILES
                         Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this 
                         one is rather atypically made from 
                         100% Pinot Noir.

                                     JACK
                         Pinot noir? Not again!
                              (joking, to Chris)
                         You know, not all Pinots are noir.

               They laugh.

               Miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then 
               lifts it to smell. Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps 
               even spilling some wine in the process.

                                     MILES
                         Let me show you.

               We see details of what Miles now describes.

                                     MILES
                         First take your glass and examine 
                         the wine against the light. You're 
                         looking at color and clarity.

                                     JACK
                         What color is it supposed to be?

                                     MILES
                         Depends on the varietal. Just get a 
                         sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? 
                         Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...

                                     JACK
                         Huh.

                                     MILES
                         Now tip it. What you're doing here 
                         is checking for color density as it 
                         thins toward the rim. Tells you how 
                         old it is, among other things, usually 
                         more important with reds. This is a 
                         very young wine, so it's going to 
                         retain its color pretty solidly. Now 
                         stick your nose in it.

               Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume 
               bottle.

                                     MILES
                         Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.

               Jack now buries his nose in the glass.

                                     MILES
                         What do you smell?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?

               Miles smells.

                                     MILES
                         There's not much there yet, but you 
                         can still find...
                              (more sniffs)
                         ...a little citrus... maybe some 
                         strawberry... passion fruit... and 
                         there's even a hint of like 
                         asparagus... or like a nutty Edam 
                         cheese.

               Jack smells again and begins to brighten.

                                     JACK
                         Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, 
                         strawberry. I'm not so sure about 
                         the cheese.

                                     MILES
                         Now set your glass down and get some 
                         air into it.

               Miles expertly swirls the wine. Jack follows suit.

                                     MILES
                         Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks 
                         the aroma and the flavors. Very 
                         important. Now we smell again.

               They do so. Jack smiles.

                                     MILES
                         That's what you do with every one.

                                     JACK
                         When do we get to drink it?

                                     MILES
                         Now.

               Jack gulps his wine down in one shot. Miles chews his before 
               swallowing.

                                     JACK
                         How would you rate this one?

                                     MILES
                         Usually they start you on the wines 
                         with learning disabilities, but this 
                         one's pretty damn good.
                              (to Chris)
                         This is the new one, right, Chris?

                                     CHRIS
                         Released it about two months ago.

                                     MILES
                         Nice job.

                                     CHRIS
                         We like it.

                                     JACK
                              (to Miles)
                         You know, you could work in a wine 
                         store.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, that would be a good move.

               Now Miles notices something about Jack.

                                     MILES
                         Are you chewing gum?

                                     JACK
                         Want some?

               EXT. SOLVANG, CALIFORNIA - DAY

               The Saab passes through this Danish-themed tourist town. 

               SUPERIMPOSE --

                                         SOLVANG

               EXT. BUELLTON, CALIFORNIA - DAY

               The Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central 
               coast town right off the freeway.

               SUPERIMPOSE --

                                         BUELLTON

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look --
               there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless.  

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Miles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto 
               their respective beds.

               LATER --

               The sounds of a SHOWER and OFF-KEY SINGING come from the 
               bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed. He pounds 
               on the wall.

                                     MILES
                         Hey Jack, hurry up!

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         Just a minute!

               Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and 
               tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 246 - DUSK

               Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble 
               along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They 
               pass a mall and a car dealership.

                                     JACK
                         I thought you said it was close. Now 
                         I'm all pitted out.

                                     MILES
                         It's not even a mile.

                                     JACK
                         We should have driven.

                                     MILES
                         Not with the wine list these people 
                         have. We don't want to hold back.

                                     JACK
                         You think I'm making a mistake 
                         marrying Christine?

                                     MILES
                         Whoa.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, do you think I'm doing the 
                         right thing? Tell the truth. You've 
                         been through it.

                                     MILES
                         Well, you waited for good reason, 
                         and you proposed to Christine for 
                         some good reason. So I think it's 
                         great. It's time. You've got to have 
                         your eyes open, that's all. I mean, 
                         look at me. I thought Victoria and I 
                         were set for life.

                                     JACK
                         Christine's dad -- he's been talking 
                         about bringing me into his property 
                         business. Showing me the ropes. And 
                         that's something, considering how 
                         long it took him to get over I'm not 
                         Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. 
                         But I don't know, might get a little 
                         incestuous. But Mike does pretty 
                         well. A lot of high-end commercial 
                         stuff.

                                     MILES
                         So you're going to stop acting?

                                     JACK
                         No way. This would just provide some 
                         stability is what I'm saying. I can 
                         always squeeze in an audition or a 
                         commercial here and there, you know, 
                         keep myself in the game in case 
                         something big comes along.

                                     MILES
                         Uh-huh.

                                     JACK
                         We're not getting any younger, right? 
                         And my career, well, it's gotten 
                         pretty, you know, frustrating. Even 
                         with my new manager. Maybe it's time 
                         to settle down.

                                     MILES
                         If that's what feels right.

                                     JACK
                              (convincing himself)
                         It does. Feels right.

                                     MILES
                         Then it's a good thing.

                                     JACK
                              (nodding, feeling 
                              better)
                         Yeah. It's good. Feels good.

               Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking 
               lot. The camera PANS to reveal --

               THE HITCHING POST, a local institution.

               INT. HITCHING POST BAR - DUSK

               Miles and Jack belly up. GARY, the Samoan bartender, spots 
               Miles and extends a welcoming hand.

                                     GARY
                         Hey, Miles. Long time no see.

                                     MILES
                         Gary.

                                     GARY
                         When's that novel of yours coming 
                         out?  We  all want to read it.

                                     MILES
                         Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy 
                         Jack. He's getting married next week.

                                     GARY
                              (shaking Jack's hand)
                         My condolences.

                                     MILES
                         What are you pouring tonight?

                                     GARY
                         Lot of good stuff.
                              (looking at a row of 
                              bottles)
                         Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?

                                     MILES
                         Absolutement.
                              (to Jack)
                         They have their own label that's 
                         just outstanding.

               Gary pours Jack and Miles a generous sample and the two men 
               swirl, sniff and taste. Jack is beginning to get the hang of 
               things.

                                     GARY
                         What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         Tight as a nun's asshole but qood 
                         concentration. Nice fruit.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. Tight.

                                     MILES
                              (to Gary)
                         Pour us a couple.

               Gary fills their glasses and corks the bottle. Jack raises 
               his glass to toast.

                                     JACK
                         Here's to my last week of freedom.

                                     MILES
                         It's going to be great. Here's to 
                         us.

               They clink their glasses and take a drink. We linger on them 
               as Miles retreats inward and a restless Jack scans the room.

               INT. HITCHING POST DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Jack and Miles review their menus. Jack looks up and spots a 
               PRETTY WAITRESS placing an order at the bar.

                                     JACK
                         Miles. Check it out.

               Miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, yeah. That's Maya.

                                     JACK
                         You know her?

                                     MILES
                         Sure I know Maya.

                                     JACK
                         You know that chick?

                                     MILES
                         Jack, this is where I eat when I 
                         come up here. It's practically my 
                         office. And sometimes I have a drink 
                         with the employees. Maya's great. 
                         She's worked here about a year, maybe 
                         a year and a half.

                                     JACK
                         She is very hot.

                                     MILES
                         And very nice. And very married. 
                         Check out the rock.

               Jack leans forward and squints.

                                     JACK
                         Doesn't mean shit. When Christine 
                         was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she 
                         wore a big engagement ring to keep 
                         guys from hitting on her. Think it 
                         worked? Fuck no. How do you think I 
                         met her?

                                     MILES
                         This gal's married to I think a 
                         Philosophy professor at UC Santa 
                         Barbara.

                                     JACK
                         So what's a professor's wife doing 
                         waitressing? Obviously that's over.

                                     MILES
                         You don't know anything about this 
                         woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, 
                         okay?
                              (focusing on the menu)
                         The duck is excellent and pairs nicely 
                         with the Highliner Pinot.

               Just then Maya comes by carrying a tray of food on her way 
               to another table.

                                     MAYA
                         Hey, Miles. Good to see you.

                                     MILES
                         Maya, how are you?

                                     MAYA
                         I'm doing good, good. You look great. 
                         Did you lose some weight?

                                     MILES
                         Oh, no, actually. Busy night.

                                     MAYA
                         Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been 
                         out tasting today?

                                     MILES
                         You know it. This is my friend Jack. 
                         Jack, Maya.

                                     JACK
                              (big smile)
                         Hiya.

                                     MAYA
                              (smiling back)
                         Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. 
                         Bye, Miles.

               She goes.

                                     JACK
                         Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes 
                         you. What else do you know about 
                         her?

                                     MILES
                         Well, she does know a lot about wine.

                                     JACK
                         Ooooooohh. Now we're getting 
                         somewhere.

                                     MILES
                         And she likes Pinot.

                                     JACK
                         Perfect.

                                     MILES
                         Jack, she's a fucking waitress in 
                         Buellton. How would that ever work?

                                     JACK
                         Why do you always focus on the 
                         negative? Didn't you see how friendly 
                         she was to you?

                                     MILES
                         She works for tips!

                                     JACK
                         You're blind, dude. Blind.

               Miles focuses again on the menu.

                                     MILES
                         I also recommend the ostrich. Very 
                         lean. Locally raised.

               INT. HITCHING POST BAR - NIGHT

               TWO BURGUNDY GLASSES --

               are refilled with the contents of yet another bottle of 
               Hitching Post Pinot Noir.

               Jack and Miles are enjoying a post-prandial drink.

               MILES

               Looks like he's thinking about something. Then --

                                     MILES
                         I hate Tony Levin.

               Jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp. Just then --

               MAYA

               Walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down. She 
               has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys, 
               lovely but tired.

                                     MAYA
                              (to Gary)
                         Highliner, please.

                                     JACK
                         That's on us.

               Maya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from 
               their bottle.

                                     MAYA
                         Hey, guys.

               Maya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and 
               lights it while Gary pours her a glass.

                                     MILES
                         You want to join us?

                                     MAYA
                              (polite)
                         Sure.

               In no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and 
               comes down the bar.

                                     MAYA
                         So how's that book of yours going, 
                         Miles? I think you were almost done 
                         with it last time we talked.

                                     MILES
                         I finished it.

                                     MAYA
                         Good for you.

                                     JACK
                         It's getting published. That's what 
                         we're up here celebrating.

               Miles shoots Jack a look. Jack responds with a "don't-fuck- 
               it-up-brother" glower.

                                     MAYA
                         That's fantastic. Congratulations.

               She offers her glass, and all clink.

                                     MAYA
                              (to Jack)
                         Are you a writer too?

                                     JACK
                         No, I'm an actor.

                                     MAYA
                         Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?

                                     JACK
                         A lot of TV. I was a regular on a 
                         couple of series. And lately I've 
                         been doing a lot of commercials. 
                         National mostly.

                                     MAYA
                         Anything I'd know?

                                     JACK
                         Maybe. Recognize this?

               Jack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect VOICE-OVER 
               VOICE.

                                     JACK
                         "Now with low, low 5.8% APR 
                         financing."

               Maya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile.

                                     MAYA
                         That's hilarious. You sound just 
                         like one of those guys.

                                     JACK
                         I am one of those guys.

                                     MAYA
                         You are not.

                                     MILES
                         He is.

               Jack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits.

                                     JACK
                              (very fast)
                         Consult your doctor before using 
                         this product. Side effects may include 
                         oily discharge, dizziness, hives, 
                         loss of appetite, difficulty breathing 
                         and low blood pressure. If you have 
                         diabetes or a history of kidney 
                         trouble... you're fucked!

               This makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh. Jack joins in. 
               Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters 
               a tight courtesy smile.

                                     MAYA
                              (winding down)
                         Oh. I needed that. Thank you.

               They all take a drink of wine.

                                     MAYA
                         So what are you guys up to tonight?

               Before Jack has a chance to speak --

                                     MILES
                         We're pretty wiped. Probably go back 
                         to the hotel and crash.

               This makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent 
               availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a 
                         long drive up here. Where're you 
                         staying?

                                     MILES
                         The Windmill.

                                     JACK
                         Windmill.

               Maya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and 
               picks up her jean jacket and purse.

                                     MAYA
                         Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.

                                     MILES
                         See you.

               As she leaves --

                                     JACK
                         We'll catch up with you later, okay?

               But she's gone. Jack gives Miles a slow burn look.

                                     JACK
                         We'll probably go back to the hotel 
                         and crash?

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as CARS WHIZ BY.

                                     JACK
                         The girl is looking to party, and 
                         you tell her we're going to go back 
                         to our motel room and crash? Jesus, 
                         Miles!

                                     MILES
                         Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

                                     JACK
                         The chick digs you. She lit up like 
                         a pinball machine when she heard 
                         your novel was getting published.

                                     MILES
                         Now I've got another lie to live 
                         down. Thanks, Jack.

                                     JACK
                         I'm trying to get you some action, 
                         but you've got to help me out just a 
                         little bit.

                                     MILES
                         Didn't seem to me like that's what 
                         was going on. You were all over her.

                                     JACK
                         Somebody had to do the talking. And 
                         by the way, I was right. She's not 
                         married.

                                     MILES
                         How do you know?

                                     JACK
                         No rock. When she came to the bar, 
                         sans rock.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               The screen is absolutely BLACK.

                                     JACK
                         Single. Waitress. Getting off work. 
                         Looking for love. A little slap and 
                         tickle.

                                     MILES
                         Shut up.

                                     JACK
                         She probably went home, lit some 
                         candles, put on some relaxing music, 
                         took a nice hot bath, and laid down 
                         on her bed with her favorite vibrator.

               Jack begins to make a soft BUZZING noise, growing gradually 
               louder and more rhythmic.

                                     MILES
                         Have you no shame?

                                     JACK
                         Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Fuck you.

               There's now a rustling noise and footsteps. Then a LIGHT is 
               flipped on in the BATHROOM.

               Miles closes the door behind him, and the only light visible 
               is at the bottom of the bathroom door.

               Miles PEES -- a series of semi-forced SHORT SQUIRTS. Then a 
               FLUSH as a door opens and the light goes off. Jack starts 
               BUZZING again.

                                     MILES
                         Shut the fuck up!

               Jack stops and Miles climbs into bed. Silence. Then --

                                     JACK
                         You need to get your prostate checked.

               UNDER BLACK --

                                          MONDAY

               EXT. BREAKFAST CAFE - DAY

               Establishing.

               INT. BREAKFAST CAFE - DAY

               Miles and Jack are glancing at the menus. For some reason 
               Jack is humorless and grumpy.

                                     MILES
                         So what're we going to have? Pigs in 
                         a blanket? The "rancher's special 
                         breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease 
                         and fat with a side of lard?

                                     JACK
                              (not amused)
                         So what's the plan today?

                                     MILES
                         We head north, begin the grape tour 
                         up there, make our way south so the 
                         more we drink the closer we get to 
                         the motel.

               Jack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple.

                                     MILES
                         What's your problem?

               Jack exhales and looks away, as though he doesn't want to 
               get into it.

                                     MILES
                         What is it?

               Jack sucks his teeth a moment searching for the right words. 
               Then the dam bursts.

                                     JACK
                         I am going to get my nut on this 
                         trip, Miles. And you are not going 
                         to fuck it up for me with all your 
                         depression and anxiety and neg-head 
                         downer shit.

                                     MILES
                         Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.

                                     JACK
                         Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do 
                         not fuck with me. I am going to get 
                         laid before I settle down on Saturday. 
                         Do you read me?

                                     MILES
                         Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. 
                         It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in 
                         the way and dragging you down. Maybe 
                         you'd have a better time on your 
                         own. You take the car. I'll catch 
                         the train back.

                                     JACK
                         No, see, I want both of us to get 
                         crazy. We should both be cutting 
                         loose. I mean, this is our last 
                         chance. This is our week! It should 
                         be something we share.

               The older WAITRESS comes over.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I take your order?

                                     JACK
                         But I am warning you.

                                     MILES
                         Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye 
                         toast. Dry.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Okay. And you?

                                     JACK
                              (glaring at Miles)
                         Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup.

               EXT. LOVELY HIGHWAY - DAY

               The Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through 
               large open vineyards.

               Framed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the 
               distance.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FOXEN WINERY - DAY

               Miles has just downed a taste of red wine.

                                     MILES
                         How much skin and stem contact?

                                     POURER
                         About four weeks.

                                     MILES
                         Huh. That explains all the tannins. 
                         And how long in oak?

                                     POURER
                         About a year.

                         French or American?

                                     POURER
                         Both.

                                     MILES
                         Good stuff.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, oak. That's a good wood.

               Just as the pourer turns away toward other TASTERS, Jack 
               GRABS the bottle and helps himself and Miles to another glass. 
               They slam back their drinks like tequila.

               EXT. LOVELY AREA ON A HILL - DAY

               Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out. Before 
               them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards.

                                     MILES
                         Nice, huh?

                                     JACK
                         Beautiful.

                                     MILES
                         Victoria and I used to like this 
                         view.
                              (lost in nostalgia)
                         Once we had a picnic here and drank 
                         a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon 
                         and artichokes, but we didn't care.

                                     JACK
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         She has the best palate of any woman 
                         I've ever known. She could even 
                         differentiate Italian wines.

                                     JACK
                         Miles, I gotta tell you something. 
                         Victoria's coming to the wedding.

                                     MILES
                         I know. You told me. I'm okay with 
                         it.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, but that's not the whole story. 
                         She got remarried.

                                     MILES
                         She what?
                              (long pause)
                         When?

                                     JACK
                         About a month ago. Six weeks.

                                     MILES
                         To that guy? That guy with the 
                         restaurant...

               Jack nods. Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long 
               breath. Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes 
               the door.

                                     JACK
                         Miles... MILES...

               Miles continues to stare straight ahead.

                                     JACK
                              (exploding)
                         Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!

                                     MILES
                         I want to go home now.

                                     JACK
                         You've been divorced for two years 
                         already. People move on. She has! 
                         It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes 
                         you feel special or something.

                                     MILES
                         Is she bringing him to the wedding?

                                     JACK
                         What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         You drop this bombshell on me. Why 
                         didn't you tell me before?

                                     JACK
                         Because I knew you'd freak out and 
                         probably get so depressed you wouldn't 
                         even come on this trip. But then I 
                         figured here would be the best place 
                         to tell you. We're here to forget 
                         about all that shit. We're here to 
                         party!

                                     MILES
                              (undeterred)
                         I'm going to be a fucking pariah. 
                         Everyone's just going to be holding 
                         their breath to see if I'm going to 
                         get drunk and make a scene. Plus 
                         Tony fucking Levin?

                                     JACK
                         No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to 
                         Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's 
                         cool.

                                     MILES
                              (horrified)
                         You've all been talking about it? 
                         Behind my back? Talking about it?

               Miles turns and locates an open BOTTLE of wine in the back 
               seat. He uncorks it and begins to swig.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't!

               Jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from Miles, but 
               Miles bolts out of the car.

               A VERY WIDE SHOT --

               Pursued by Jack, Miles dashes down the hill, all the while 
               taking huge swigs from the bottle.

               OMIT.

               EXT. LOVELY VINEYARD - CONTINUOUS

               Miles slows to walk between rows of GRAPEVINES. He polishes 
               off the bottle and tosses it. A painting Jack catches up 
               with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor.

               Miles's face crumbles as though he were about to cry. Then 
               he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight.

               Jack looks around impatiently for a moment. Then he squats 
               down so he can see Miles underneath the vines.

                                     JACK
                         Miles?

               Miles ignores Jack and focuses on the beautiful RIPE GRAPES 
               that surround him. They seem to distract him from his pain.

                                     JACK
                         You going to be okay?

               Miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive NO. Jack 
               can't help but LAUGH.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The sun hangs low as the Saab pulls into the parking lot, 
               Jack at the wheel.

               INT. KALYRA TASTING ROOM - DAY

               The pourer, a brunette in her early thirties, breaks away 
               from a BORING COUPLE down the bar. This is STEPHANIE.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Hey, guys. How's it going?

                                     JACK
                         Excellent. My friend and I are up 
                         here doing the wine tour, and he 
                         tells me that you folks make one 
                         hell of a Syrah.

                         That's what people say.

                                     MILES
                              (slurring slightly)
                         You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he 
                         didn't know Pinot Noir from film 
                         noir.

                                     JACK
                         I'm a quick learner.

               Stephanie laughs. She apparently likes big good-natured lunks 
               like Jack.

                                     MILES
                         I'm trying to teach my friend here 
                         some basics about wine over the next 
                         few days before he goes off and --

               WHOOMP! Under the bar Jack stomps on Miles's foot. Miles 
               winces.

               Stephanie slides TWO GLASSES in front of them.

                                     JACK
                         That's right -- I'm here to learn. I 
                         never had that much interest in wine 
                         before, but this trip has been very 
                         enlightening. Always like wine, of 
                         course, but I don't know. More of a 
                         beer man, really. Microbreweries.

               She THUMPS the cork off a bottle of Chardonnay.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Well, no better way to learn than 
                         tasting.

               She pours almost flirtatious amounts.

                                     JACK
                         Now there's a girl who knows how to 
                         pour. What's your name?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Stephanie.

                                     JACK
                         Nice.

               Jack swirls the wine as though he were by now a sommelier. 
               They look, they smell, they taste.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         So what do you think?

                                     MILES
                         Quaffable but far from transcendent.

                                     JACK
                         I like it. Tastes great. Oaky.

               Stephanie reaches for another bottle and pours. Jack's eyes 
               never leave her.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Cabernet Franc.
                              (as they taste)
                         This is only the fifth year we've 
                         made this varietal. Very few wineries 
                         around here do a straight Cabernet 
                         Franc. It's from our vineyard up in 
                         Santa Maria. And it was a Silver 
                         Medal winner at Paso Robles last 
                         year.

                                     MILES
                         Well, I've come to never expect 
                         greatness from a Cab Franc, and this 
                         one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, 
                         overripe --

                                     JACK
                              (ignoring him)
                         Tastes good to me. You live around 
                         here, Stephanie?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         In Santa Ynez.
                              (low, to Miles)
                         And I agree with you about Cab Franc.

                                     JACK
                         Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. 
                         Windmill Inn.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Oh yeah.

                                     JACK
                         You know a gal named Maya? Works at 
                         the Hitching Post?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Sure I know Maya. Real well.

                                     JACK
                         No shit. We just had a drink with 
                         her last night. Miles knows her.

                                     MILES
                         Could we move on to the Syrah, please?

               As she turns to reach for the right bottle, Jack winks at 
               Miles. Miles shakes his head.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         This is our Estate Syrah...

               She pours each of them a full HALF GLASS.

                                     JACK
                         You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         I know. I might need to be spanked.

               She notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has 
               been monopolized.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Excuse me.

               As she wanders down the bar, Jack turns to Miles, his mouth 
               wide open.

                                     JACK
                         A bad girl, Miles. She might need to 
                         be spanked.

                                     MILES
                         Do you know how often these pourers 
                         get hit on?

               They glance down the bar at Stepanie. She smiles back.

               EXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY

               Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes. He 
               looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room 
               with TWO CASES OF WINE.

                                     JACK
                         Get the trunk.

                                     MILES
                         You have the keys.

               Jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building.

                                     JACK
                         We're on.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         She called Maya, who's not working 
                         tonight, so we're all going out.

                                     MILES
                         With Maya?

                                     JACK
                         Been divorced for a year now, bud.

               Jack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car.

                                     JACK
                         Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it 
                         all going on.

                                     MILES
                         Well, she is cute.

                                     JACK
                         Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And 
                         you almost tell her I'm getting 
                         married. What's the matter with you?
                              (drumming on the 
                              steering wheel)
                         Gotta love it. Gotta love it.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               THE TV --

               GOLF on ESPN.

               MILES AND JACK

               sit transfixed, each on his own bed. The curtains are drawn. 
               Then out of nowhere --

                                     JACK
                              (mocking)
                         You know how often these pourers get 
                         hit on?
                              (getting up)
                         I'm going for a swim. Get the blood 
                         flowing. Want to come?

                                     MILES
                         Nah. I want to watch this.

               CLOSE ON THE TV --

               A guy gets ready to putt. The announcer whispers what an 
               important moment this is. The guy misses.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               UNDER BLACK --

               The sound of an AEROSOL CAN.

                                     JACK
                         Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up.

               WE OPEN OUR EYES TO SEE --

               Jack spraying his feet with some Dr. Scholl's product.

               WIDE --

               Miles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his 
               suitcase.

                                     JACK
                         Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi --
                         goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts 
                         up here. Whole place is wide open. 
                         Assylvania.

               Jack does some actor's weird warm-up stretch.

                                     MILES
                         So what should I wear?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Casual but nice. They 
                         think you're a writer.

               As Miles begins to dig through his suitcase, Jack flips open 
               his cellphone and speed-dials.

                                     JACK
                         Don't you have any other shoes?

               Miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor.

                                     JACK
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking 
                         in. Not much. We're about to go out 
                         for dinner, probably be out pretty 
                         late, so I thought I'd say goodnight 
                         now. I know, I love you too. I miss 
                         you.

               EXT. LOS OLIVOS - NIGHT

               The boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk 
               in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet 
               restaurants.

                                     JACK
                         Please just try to be your normal 
                         humorous self, okay? Like who you 
                         were before the tailspin. Do you 
                         remember that guy? People love that 
                         guy. And don't forget -- your novel 
                         is coming out in the fall.

                                     MILES
                         Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it 
                         called?

                                     JACK
                         Do not sabotage me. If you want to 
                         be a lightweight, that's your call. 
                         But do not sabotage me.

                                     MILES
                         Aye-aye, captain.

                                     JACK
                         And if they want to drink Merlot, 
                         we're drinking Merlot.

                                     MILES
                              (dead serious)
                         If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. 
                         I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!

                                     JACK
                         Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No 
                         Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?

               Miles takes a SMALL BOTTLE from his pocket and rattles it.

                                     JACK
                         And don't drink too much. I don't 
                         want you going to the dark side or 
                         passing out. Do you hear me? No going 
                         to the dark side.

                                     MILES
                         Okay! Fuck!

               Miles quickly POPS A XANAX. Jack gives him a final look in 
               the eye.

                                     JACK
                         We're going in.

               INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - NIGHT

               The boys enter this cozy if crowded restaurant and exchange 
               words with the HOSTESS. Then they notice --

               MAYA AND STEPHANIE

               at a booth waving at them. They look great.

               MILES AND JACK

               make their way to the table, Jack wearing a broad, confident 
               SMILE.

               AT THE TABLE --

               Jack plops down next to Stephanie, while Miles politely eases 
               in on Maya's side. Jack touches a hand to Stephanie's bare 
               neck and massages it meaningfully.

                                     JACK
                         How you doin' tonight, beautiful?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Good. How're you?

                                     JACK
                         Great. You look great.
                              (including Maya)
                         You both do.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Not so bad yourself.

               Meanwhile Miles looks over at Maya and purses his lips in an 
               affable if uncomfortable smile. Then --

                                     MILES
                         What are you drinking?

                                     MAYA
                         A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.

                                     MILES
                         Oh yeah? How is it?

                                     MAYA
                              (sliding the glass)
                         Try it.

               As Miles swirls the wine and takes a sip, he begins to relax.

                                     MILES
                         Nice. Very nice.

                                     MAYA
                         Twelve months in oak.

                                     MILES
                         On a Sauvignon Blanc?

                                     MAYA
                         I know the winemaker. She comes in 
                         the restaurant all the time.

                                     MILES
                         This is good. Little hints of clove.

                                     MAYA
                         I know. I love that.

               LATER --

               A WAITER finishes listing off the specials.

                                     WAITER
                         ...medallions of pork with a dusting 
                         of black truffles served with a root 
                         vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped 
                         potatoes. And finally a Copper River 
                         salmon grilled on an alder wood plank. 
                         And that comes with roasted new 
                         potatoes and steamed watercress.

               The four diners exchange looks of delight.

                                     WAITER
                         And who gets the wine list?

               Miles raises his hand and takes the leather-bound book.

                                     MAYA
                              (teasing)
                         I guess Miles wants it.

               Jack glares at Miles, who immediately gets the hint.

                                     MILES
                         Nope. You ladies choose.

               Jack smiles and nods his approval. Jack takes the book out 
               of Miles's hands and offers it to the girls.

                                     MAYA
                         You choose, Stephanie.

                                     STEPHANIE
                              (opening it)
                         So what does everyone feel like?

                                     JACK
                         Whatever you girls want. It's on us 
                         tonight. Sky's the limit.

                                     MAYA
                         No, we're paying for the wine.

                                     JACK
                         I don't think so. We're celebrating 
                         Miles's book deal.

                                     MAYA
                         Well, in that case...

               Miles draws a long breath.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         What's everyone ordering? Then we 
                         can sort out the wine.

                                     MILES
                         Exactement!

               Jack shoots Miles a look.

                                     MAYA
                         I'm having the salmon.

                                     MILES
                         That's what I'm having.

                                     STEPHANIE
                              (still scanning the 
                              wines)
                         I'm thinking about the duck breast.

                                     JACK
                              (slapping his menu 
                              shut)
                         Me too.

                                     MAYA
                         Well, that narrows things down.

               Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over 
               the top. She looks at the others, and they look back at her.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.

               Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE.

                                     JACK
                         Pinot!

               Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls 
               to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!

               DINNER is improvised, but includes:

               -- The arrival of the FIRST WINE.

               -- The SALADS.

               -- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her 
               finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS.

               -- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND 
               WINE.

               -- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles.

               -- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier.

               -- The SALMON and DUCK arrive.

               -- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested 
               and available -- it's too much for him.

               -- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, 
               the cutting choppier.

               -- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya 
               and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his 
               jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't.

               -- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm 
               shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down."

               CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble 
               of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much 
               that he spaces out, descending into --

               INT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS

               Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river, 
               the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded 
               boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over 
               to the dark side.

               INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN

               Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in 
               their own little world -- Jack explaining something to 
               Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING.

               -- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused 
               expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent.

               -- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard.

               -- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short 
               but sensual kiss.

               MOMENTS LATER --

               Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables. 
               He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person 
               perspectives.

               AT THE BATHROOMS --

               He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked. He pulls the 
               XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing 
               it dry.

               He notices a PAYPHONE nearby. Thinking better of it for a 
               moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver.

               CLOSE ON THE KEYPAD --

               as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely 
               out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone 
               RINGING and a PICKUP.

               THE RECEIVER --

               As Miles presses it desperately to his head.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Hello?

                                     MILES
                         Victoria.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles?

               Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone.

                                     MILES
                         Victoria! How the hell are you?

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Fine. What's, uh, what's on your 
                         mind?

                                     MILES
                         Heard you got remarried! 
                         Congratulations. Didn't think you 
                         had the stomach for another go-round.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Oh, Miles. You're drunk.

                                     MILES
                         Just some local Pinot, you know, 
                         then a little Burgundy. That old 
                         Cotes de Beaune!

               Miles laughs at his own non-existent joke.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Where are you?

                                     MILES
                         A little place in Los Olivos. New 
                         owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent 
                         food too -- you should try it. Thought 
                         of you at the Hitching Post last 
                         night.

               Silence.

                                     MILES (CONT' D)
                         Hello?

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles, don't call me when you're 
                         drunk.

                                     MILES
                         I just wanted you to know I've decided 
                         not to go to the wedding, so in case 
                         you were dreading some uncomfortable, 
                         you know, run-in or something, well, 
                         worry no more. You won't see me there. 
                         My wedding gift to you and what's-
                         his-name. What is his name?

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                              (silence, then --)
                         Ken.

                                     MILES
                         Ken.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles, I don't care if you come to 
                         the wedding or not.

                                     MILES
                         Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you 
                         guys have fun.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         I'm going to hang up now, Miles.

                                     MILES
                              (rushing to keep her 
                              on)
                         You see, Vicki, I just heard about 
                         this today, you getting married that 
                         is, and I was kind of taken aback. 
                         Kind of hard to believe.

               Silence.

                                     MILES
                         I guess I just thought there was 
                         still some hope for us somewhere 
                         down the road and I just, I just --

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles, maybe it is better if you 
                         don't come to the wedding.

               Miles sucks something from between his two front teeth.

                                     MILES
                         Whatever you say, Vicki. You're the 
                         boss.

               He HANGS UP as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call 
               and heads back to the table.

               EXT. DEEP CANYON - DAY

               For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow ROPE BRIDGE 
               extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.

               INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN

               Miles reaches the table, tries to sit and SLIPS ONTO THE 
               FLOOR.

               Although at first Jack blinks heavily in disgust, the girls 
               burst into hysterical LAUGHTER. Jack then laughs too, perhaps 
               OVER-LAUGHING.

                                     JACK
                         Easy, boy. Easy.

               Maya helps him back into the booth.

                                     MAYA
                         Are you all right?

                                     MILES
                         Fine. Just slipped.
                              (picking up his glass)
                         This is my blood.

               Miles drinks. Stephanie makes a head gesture to Maya, who 
               nods in return.

                                     STEPHANIE
                              (to the guys)
                         Excuse us.

                                     MAYA
                         Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         That's okay.

               Miles and Jack allow the girls to pass. Then --

                                     JACK
                         What the fuck, man? What is up?

               Miles reaches for his wine glass, but Jack moves it away.

                                     JACK
                         Pull yourself together, man.

                                     MILES
                         I'm fine!

               But in throwing open his arms for emphasis, he spills a WATER 
               GLASS. Jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth.

                                     JACK
                         Where were you?

                                     MILES
                         Bathroom.

                                     JACK
                         Did you drink and dial?

               Miles's silence confirms his guilt and shame.

                                     JACK
                         Why do you always do this? Victoria's 
                         gone, man. Gone. Poof.

               Miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing 
               out an exhale through his nose.

                                     JACK
                         Stop it. You are blowing a great 
                         opportunity here, Miles. Fucking 
                         Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. 
                         She's funny. She knows wine. What is 
                         this morose come-down bullshit? These 
                         girls want to party. And what was 
                         that fucking ten-minute lecture on, 
                         what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come 
                         on!

                                     MILES
                         Let's just say I'm uncomfortable 
                         with the whole scenario.

                                     JACK
                         Oh Jesus, Miles.

               Miles belligerently reaches for his Comte Armand. Jack lets 
               it pass.

                                     JACK
                         And don't forget all the bad times 
                         you had with Victoria. How small she 
                         make you feel. That's why you had 
                         the affair in the first place.

                                     MILES
                         Shut up. Shut your face.

                                     JACK
                         Don't you see how Maya's looking at 
                         you? You got her on the hook. Reel 
                         her in! Come on, let's rachet this 
                         up a notch. You know how to to do 
                         it. Here.
                              (passing a glass)
                         Drink some agua.

               Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it.

               The girls now return to the table. The guys slide over.

                                     MILES
                              (trying to appear 
                              sober)
                         Should we get dessert?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         We were thinking. Why don't we go 
                         back to my place? I've got wine, 
                         some insane cheeses, music, whatever.

               Jack raises both arms like a football referee.

                                     JACK
                         Excellent idea. Waiter!

               INT. SAAB - NIGHT

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

               Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed 
               into the woods.

               INSIDE --

               Jack drives. Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense 
               of A HAND-DRAWN MAP.

                                     JACK
                              (grabbing the map)
                         Let me see that.

               EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop 
               outside this wood-framed cottage.

               Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the 
               way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string 
               of FOUR CONDOMS.

                                     JACK
                              (tearing)
                         Here. One for you, three for me.

               Miles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch 
               steps --

                                     MILES
                         You sure you want to do this?

               Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile 
               incredulity.

               THE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR 
               before going in.

               INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The boys enter this modest living room furnished with 
               weathered but charming old furniture. Scattered here and 
               there are CHILDREN'S TOYS. FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the 
               walls. CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing.

                                     JACK
                         We're here!

               Stephanie sails in.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         What happened to you guys?

                                     JACK
                         Couple of wrong turns.
                              (pointing a thumb at 
                              Miles)
                         Thanks to Magellan, here.

               After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss.

                                     JACK
                         Hi.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Hi.
                              (to Miles)
                         Maya's in the kitchen.

               Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward --

               EXT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little 
               temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT.

                                     MILES
                         Hi.

                                     MAYA
                         Hey.

                                     MILES
                         She got anything good?

                                     MAYA
                         Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots 
                         and Syrahs.
                              (calling out)
                         Hey, Steph? You sure we can open 
                         anything? Anything we want?

                                     STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                         Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!

                                     MILES
                         She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I 
                         have completely underestimated 
                         Stephanie.

                                     MAYA
                         Who do you think you're dealing with 
                         here?

               Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX.

                                     MAYA
                         How about this?

               Miles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between 
               Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it 
               back in.

                                     MAYA
                         Nope. I don't think we know each 
                         other well enough.
                              (picking out another 
                              bottle)
                         I'd say this guy's more our speed.

               They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and, 
               raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it.

                                     MAYA
                         So what gems do you have in your 
                         collection?

                                     MILES
                         Not much of a collection really. I 
                         haven't had the wallet for that, so 
                         I sort of live bottle to bottle. But 
                         I've got a couple things I'm saving. 
                         I guess the star would be a 1961 
                         Cheval Blanc.

                                     MAYA
                         You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's 
                         just sitting there? Go get it.
                              (pushing him, playfully 
                              stern)
                         Right now. Hurry up...

               Miles laughs, fights back a bit.

                                     MAYA
                         Seriously, the '61s are peaking, 
                         aren't they? At least that's what 
                         I've read.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     MAYA
                         It might be too late already. What 
                         are you waiting for?

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. Special occasion. With 
                         the right person. It was supposed to 
                         be for my tenth wedding anniversary.

               Understanding, Maya considers her response.

                                     MAYA
                         The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, 
                         that's the special occasion.

                                     MILES
                         How long have you been into wine?

                                     MAYA
                         I started to get serious about seven 
                         years ago.

                                     MILES
                         What was the bottle that did it?

                                     MAYA
                         Eighty-eight Sassicaia.

               Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. Maya pours, and they 
               clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.

                                     MILES
                         Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but 
                         this is tasty. Really good. How about 
                         you?

                                     MAYA
                              (tastes again)
                         I think they overdid it a bit. Too 
                         much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.

                                     MILES
                              (tasting again, 
                              impressed)
                         Yeah, I'd say you're right on the 
                         money.

               Then Miles absently scans the REFRIGERATOR DOOR and spots a 
               PHOTO of Stephanie holding a LITTLE GIRL.

                                     MILES
                         Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is 
                         cute.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.

                                     MILES
                         Is she sleeping or...?

                                     MAYA
                         She's with her grandmother. She's 
                         with Steph's mom. She spends a lot 
                         of time over there. Steph's... well, 
                         she's Stephanie.  

               Jack's voice-over voice from the other room...

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         "And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."

               ...is followed by PEALS OF LAUGHTER.

                                     MAYA
                         You got kids?

                                     MILES
                         Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. 
                         That was the one unpolluted part of 
                         my divorce -- no kids.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah, same here.

               Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment, 
               thinking about something else.

                                     MAYA
                         Let's go in there.

               Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into --

               INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Jack and Stephanie are gone. From a distant bedroom comes 
               more laughter.

                                     MAYA
                         Looks like our friends are hitting 
                         it off.

               While Maya goes to turn down the STEREO, Miles sits on the 
               couch. Maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving Miles a 
               glimpse of the small of HER BACK.

               She takes a seat opposite Miles on the couch. They look at 
               each other without speaking. Just what is the vibe here?

                                     MAYA
                         It's kind of weird sitting here with 
                         you in Stephanie's house. All those 
                         times you came into the restaurant. 
                         It's like you're a real person now. 
                         Almost.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. 
                         Out of context.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah, weird. But great.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah. Definitely.

               An awkward silence, broken by Maya.

                                     MAYA
                         So what's your novel about?

                                     MILES
                         Well, it's a little difficult to 
                         summarize. It begins as a first-person 
                         account of a guy taking care of his 
                         father after a stroke. Kind of based 
                         on personal experience, but only 
                         loosely.

                                     MAYA
                         What's the title?

                                     MILES
                         "The Day After Yesterday."

                                     MAYA
                         Oh. You mean... today?

                                     MILES
                         Um... yeah but it's more...

                                     MAYA
                         So is it kind of about death and 
                         mortality, or...?

                                     MILES
                         Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It 
                         shifts around a lot. Like you also 
                         start to see everything from the 
                         point of view of the father. And 
                         some other stuff happens, some 
                         parallel narrative, and then it 
                         evolves -- or devolves -- into a 
                         kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- 
                         you know, with no real resolution.

                                     MAYA
                         Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing 
                         you're getting it published. Really. 
                         I know how hard it is. Just to write 
                         it even.

                                     MILES
                              (squeezing it out)
                         Yeah. Thanks.

                                     MAYA
                         Like me, I have this stupid paper 
                         due on Friday, and as usual I'm 
                         freaked out about it. Just like in 
                         high school. It never changes.

                                     MILES
                         A paper?

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah. I'm working on a masters in 
                         horticulture. Chipping away at it.

                                     MILES
                         Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know 
                         there was a college here.

                                     MAYA
                         I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a 
                         week.

                                     MILES
                         So... you want to work for a winery 
                         or something someday?

                                     MAYA
                         Well...

                                     MILES
                         I do have a copy of the manuscript 
                         in the car. It's not fully proofed, 
                         but if you're okay with a few typos...

                                     MAYA
                         Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of 
                         typos.
                              (sipping the wine)
                         Wow, this is really starting to open 
                         up. What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         My palate's kind of shot, but from 
                         what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty 
                         damn good.

                                     MAYA
                         Can I ask you a personal question?

                                     MILES
                              (bracing himself)
                         Sure.

                                     MAYA
                         Why are you so into Pinot? It's like 
                         a thing with you.

               Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. 
               He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. It's a hard grape to 
                         grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, 
                         temperamental, ripens early. It's 
                         not a survivor like Cabernet that 
                         can grow anywhere and thrive even 
                         when neglected. Pinot needs constant 
                         care and attention and in fact can 
                         only grow in specific little tucked-
                         away corners of the world. And only 
                         the most patient and nurturing growers 
                         can do it really, can tap into Pinot's 
                         most fragile, delicate qualities. 
                         Only when someone has taken the time 
                         to truly understand its potential 
                         can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest 
                         expression. And when that happens, 
                         its flavors are the most haunting 
                         and brilliant and subtle and thrilling 
                         and ancient on the planet.

               Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.

                                     MILES
                         I mean, Cabernets can be powerful 
                         and exalting, but they seem prosaic 
                         to me for some reason. By comparison. 
                         How about you?

                                     MAYA
                         What about me?

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. Why are you into wine?

                                     MAYA
                         I suppose I got really into wine 
                         originally through my ex-husband. He 
                         had a big, kind of show-off cellar. 
                         But then I found out that I have a 
                         really sharp palate, and the more I 
                         drank, the more I liked what it made 
                         me think about.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah? Like what?

                                     MAYA
                         Like what a fraud he was.

               Miles laughs.

                                     MAYA
                         No, but I do like to think about the 
                         life of wine, how it's a living thing. 
                         I like to think about what was going 
                         on the year the grapes were growing, 
                         how the sun was shining that summer 
                         or if it rained... what the weather 
                         was like. I think about all those 
                         people who tended and picked the 
                         grapes, and if it's an old wine, how 
                         many of them must be dead by now. I 
                         love how wine continues to evolve, 
                         how every time I open a bottle it's 
                         going to taste different than if I 
                         had opened it on any other day. 
                         Because a bottle of wine is actually 
                         alive -- it's constantly evolving 
                         and gaining complexity. That is, 
                         until it peaks -- like your '61 -- 
                         and begins its steady, inevitable 
                         decline. And it tastes so fucking 
                         good.

               Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells 
               us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs 
               another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches 
               out and places one hand atop his.

                                     MILES
                              (pointing)
                         Bathroom over there?

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah.

               Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American 
               Spirit out of her purse.

               INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

               The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and 
               the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S 
               BATH TOYS.

               Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, 
               trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and 
               without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks. 
               Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.

                                     MILES
                         You are such a loser. Come on!

               INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's 
               not there.

               Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through 
               the door into --

               INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.

                                     MAYA
                         I was just getting some water. You 
                         want some water?

               Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water. 
               Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and 
               looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is 
               long gone.

               He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels 
               strained and awkward.

               After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.

                                     MAYA
                         Nice.

               But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading 
               back into the living room.

                                     MAYA (O.S.)
                         I should probably get going.

               Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.

               INT. SAAB - NIGHT

               Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads 
               him through this very rural road.

               EXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts 
               it in PARK and gets out.

               AT THE SAAB --

               Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over.

                                     MAYA
                         You know how to get back to the 
                         Windmill, right?

                                     MILES
                         Got it.

                                     MAYA
                         I had a good time tonight, Miles. I 
                         really did.

                                     MILES
                         Good. So did I.

                                     MAYA
                         Okay. See you around.

                                     MILES
                         Um... did you still want to read my 
                         novel?

                                     MAYA
                         Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

               Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX, 
               and hands it to Maya.

                                     MAYA
                         Wow. Great.

               He turns around again, produces a SECOND BOX, and hands it 
               over as well.

                                     MILES
                         Hope you like it. Feel free to stop 
                         reading at any time. I'll take no 
                         offense.

                                     MAYA
                         Goodnight, Miles.

               She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek.

               After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction 
               while Miles heads in the opposite.

               OMIT.

               UNDER BLACK --

                                         TUESDAY

               Jack's cellphone RINGS.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               NOW EARLY MORNING --

               Still fully clothed, Miles staggers across the room.

               Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks 
               at the CALLER ID: "Erganian, Christine" and the number. He 
               briefly considers his options -- answer it? shut it off? --
               before placing it atop Jack's suitcase.

               The moment he lies back down on the bed, the MOTEL PHONE 
               RINGS. An old DIGITAL CLOCK next to it reads 7:l0.

               As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching 
               head, we again --

               FADE TO BLACK.

               LATER --

               VROOM! Outside a roaring MOTORCYCLE comes to a stop. Then 
               over the sound of an IDLING ENGINE come familiar if indistinct 
               VOICES and LAUGHTER.

               Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.

               FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself 
               in, flushed and exuberant.

                                     JACK
                         Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be-
                         lieve-able!

               He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without 
               closing the door unzips his pants to PEE.

                                     JACK
                         Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty 
                         nasty nasty.

                                     MILES
                         Well, I'm glad you got it out of 
                         your system. Congratulations. Mission 
                         accomplished.

               A hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has 
               left open. Down in the parking lot he sees --

               STEPHANIE

               atop a mid-sized MOTORCYCLE, wearing a weathered fringed 
               suede jacket. She gives him a big friendly wave.

               MILES

               returns the wave and goes back inside.

                                     MILES
                         You didn't invite Stephanie to come 
                         with us, did you?

               With a FLUSH Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his 
               bag.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's 
                         off today, so she and I are going on 
                         a hike.

                                     MILES
                         We were supposed to play golf.

                                     JACK
                         You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're 
                         brand new -- gift from Christine's 
                         dad.
                              (slapping some cash 
                              on the dresser)
                         It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, 
                         Stephanie and me were thinking we'd 
                         all go to the Hitching Post tonight 
                         and sit at one of Maya's tables, and 
                         she'll bring us some great wines and 
                         then we can all --

                                     MILES
                              (sitting down)
                         Count me out.

                                     JACK
                         Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last 
                         night, huh? That's a shocker. You 
                         mean getting drunk and calling 
                         Victoria didn't put you in the mood? 
                         You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's 
                         getting real old real fast, dude.

               Miles looks down. Jack heads for the door.

                                     JACK
                         Later.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, well, maybe you should check 
                         your messages first.

               Jack stops, eyeing Miles suspiciously. Miles tosses Jack his 
               phone. Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb. 
               He doesn't like what he sees.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, boy.

                                     MILES
                              (pointing at the room 
                              phone)
                         She's been leaving messages here 
                         too.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. Okay.

               He SNAPS the phone shut and puts it back.

                                     MILES
                         You should call her.

                                     JACK
                         I will.
                              (heading out the door)
                         See ya!

                                     MILES
                         Right now.

                                     JACK
                         Okay! Jesus!

               Jack picks up his phone, sits on the bed and looks defiantly 
               at Miles.

                                     JACK
                         I've got no problem calling her.

               Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to 
               his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE.

                                     JACK
                              (opening his phone)
                         Wait outside, will you?

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         That was fun last night.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a 
                         wine collection. Very impressive.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this 
                         morning. She said she had a good 
                         time too. You should call her.

               Miles says nothing.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Where's Jack?

                                     MILES
                         He had to make a phone call.

               Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it 
               up on the kickstand.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         So what are you up to today, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't 
                         know. Jack and I were supposed to go 
                         golfing.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Huh.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I reserved the tee time about 
                         a month ago.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Oops. Sorry.

                                     MILES
                         You golf?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid 
                         game. I mean, at least, I could never 
                         get into it. I tried it once.

                                     MILES
                         Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about 
                         it.

               Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door.

                                     JACK
                              (hushed)
                         Hey Miles. Miles.

               Miles ducks back inside.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                     JACK
                         Do you have that other condom?

               Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil 
               square.

                                     MILES
                         What'd Christine say?

                                     JACK
                         Lucked out -- got voice mail. 
                         Everything's cool.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - CONTINUOUS

               Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child 
               on Christmas morning.

               Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie, 
               grasping her waist.

               Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the 
               balcony.

               CLOSE ON MILES --

               As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to --

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY

               Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP, 
               SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of 
               solitude.

               INT. MOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of 
               complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS.

               Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST 
               ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course 
               winery after winery.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - DAY

               Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers. 
               He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS 
               play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS.

               OVER MILES'S SHOULDER --

               The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling 
               errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding 
               a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!"

               CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked 
               with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Miles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue. 
               Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH.

               LATER --

               Miles checks his machine.

                                     SYNTHESIZED VOICE (O.S.)
                         No new messages.

               He hangs up, disgusted.

               EXT. CHINA PANDA RESTAURANT - DAY

               A small Buellton eatery.

               INT. CHINA PANDA - DAY

               The only customer right now, Miles eats awkwardly with his 
               chopsticks.

               EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY

               Miles DRIVES ball after ball, unsuccessfully trying to release 
               his frustration.

               EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

               The Saab roars past us, perhaps going a little too fast.

               INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

               Whistling absently as he drives, Miles leans over to turn 
               the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station. Then 
               all of a sudden --

               WHUMP! The car has struck something with a hideous sound 
               followed immediately by the receding "ARF-ARF-ARF-ARF" of an 
               injured DOG in the Saab's wake. Miles applies the BRAKES.

               EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

               Miles gets out of his car just in time to see --

               A DOG

               scampering into the nearby woods. Miles looks around -- has 
               anyone seen him? Is there a nearby residence? Finding nothing, 
               Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally GIVING 
               CHASE.

               He follows the path of the dog into --

               EXT. ROADSIDE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

               Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his 
               way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill-
               fated cur.

               After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads 
               back.

               OMIT.

               EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

               Miles has returned to where he hit the dog. Just then, Miles 
               notices TWO MEXICAN CHILDREN watching him from just down the 
               road. They disappear into the bushes.

               Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs 
               behind the wheel and speeds away.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               The Saab pulls into the parking lot.

               EXT./INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Miles trudges up the stops to the room. He opens the door 
               and sees --

               JACK

               atop Stephanie, plowing her fertile fields. Despite the 
               interruption, their pace does not alter.

                                     JACK
                         Not now! Not now!

               Miles quickly shuts the door.

               INT. WINDMILL SPORTS BAR LOUNGE - DAY

               Miles pours himself another glass of Pinot. Jack comes in 
               and spots his morose friend.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, there you are.

                                     MILES
                         Yep.

                                     JACK
                         What're you drinking?

               Jack reaches over to check out the bottle's label. Miles 
               remains cool to Jack's amiability.

                                     JACK
                         Any good?

               Miles shrugs.

                                     JACK
                              (to the bartender)
                         Could I get a glass please?
                              (to Miles)
                         Stephanie took me out into the Pinot 
                         fields today. It was awesome. I think 
                         I finally got a handle on the whole 
                         process, from the soil to the vine 
                         to the -- what do you call it? -- 
                         selection and harvest. And the whole, 
                         you know, big containers where they 
                         mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes 
                         right off the vine.
                              (the new expert)
                         Still a little sour but already 
                         showing potential for great structure. 
                         Stephanie really knows her shit, 
                         Miles.

               Jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine.

                                     MILES
                         Where is Stephanie?

                                     JACK
                         Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.

                                     MILES
                         What the fuck are you doing?

                                     JACK
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         With this chick.

               Jack just looks at him.

                                     MILES
                         Does she know about Saturday?

                                     JACK
                         Um... not exactly. But I've been 
                         honest. I haven't told her I'm 
                         available. And she knows this trip 
                         up here is only for a few days. 
                         Besides...

               Jack stops short in a rare instance of self-censorship.

                                     MILES
                         Besides what?

                                     JACK
                         Well... I don't know, just... the 
                         wedding.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         Well, I've been doing some thinking.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, you've been thinking. And?

                                     JACK
                         I may have to put the wedding on 
                         hold is all.

               Miles looks at him with incredulity.

                                     JACK
                         I fully realize that making a change 
                         like that might be tricky for certain 
                         people to accept at first, but life 
                         is short, Miles. I've got to be sure 
                         I'm doing the right thing before 
                         taking such a big step. And not just 
                         for my sake. I'm thinking about 
                         Christine's feelings too. I take 
                         marriage very seriously -- always 
                         have. That's why I've never done it 
                         before. The day I get married, it's 
                         going to be the real thing.

               Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.

                                     JACK
                         Being with Stephanie has opened my 
                         eyes. She's not uptight or 
                         controlling. She's just cool. Things 
                         are so easy with her. Smells 
                         different. Tastes different. Fucks 
                         different. Fucks like an animal. I'm 
                         telling you, I went deep last night, 
                         Miles. Deep.

                                     MILES
                         Deep.

               Miles draws a long sigh.

                                     JACK
                         Don't get all judgmental on me. This 
                         is my deal. It's my life, and it's 
                         my call.

               They fall silent for a moment. Then --

                                     JACK
                         I was hoping to get some understanding 
                         from you. And I'm not getting it.

                                     MILES
                         Understanding of what?

                                     JACK
                         Like I might be in love with another 
                         woman.

                                     MILES
                         In love? Twenty-four hours with some 
                         wine-pourer chick and you think you're 
                         in love? And give up everything?

                                     JACK
                         Look who's talking. You've been there.

                                     MILES
                         Yes I have, and do I look like a 
                         happy man? Was all that drama with 
                         Brenda a happy thing for me to do? 
                         Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my 
                         life now?

                                     JACK
                         This is totally different. I'm talking 
                         about avoiding what you're talking 
                         about. That's the distinction. I 
                         have not made the commitment yet. I 
                         am not married. I have not said the 
                         words. In a few days, I might get 
                         married, and if I do, then I won't 
                         be doing stuff like this anymore. 
                         Otherwise, what's the whole point of 
                         getting married?

                                     MILES
                         And what about Stephanie? She's a 
                         woman -- with a kid. A single mom. 
                         What do you think she's looking for? 
                         Huh?

                                     JACK
                              (interrupting)
                         Here's what I'm thinking. We move up 
                         here, you and me, buy a vineyard. 
                         You design your own wine; I'll handle 
                         the business side. Then you get 
                         inspired and write a new novel. As 
                         for me, if an audition comes along, 
                         hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.

                                     MILES
                         You're crazy. You've gone crazy.

                                     JACK
                         What do you care anyway? You don't 
                         even like Christine.

                                     MILES
                         What? Of course I like Christine.

                                     JACK
                         You said she was shallow. Yeah, and 
                         a nouveau riche.

                                     MILES
                         That was three years ago after that 
                         first party!

                                     JACK
                         Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an 
                         actor. All I have is my instinct.
                              (his hand on his chest)
                         My intuition -- that's all I have. 
                         And you're asking me to go against 
                         it. And that's just wrong.

               Just then Stephanie walks in. She cozies up to Jack, and he 
               kisses the top of her head.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Hi, guys. We should probably get 
                         going.

                                     MILES
                         Where?

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DUSK

               CLOSE ON A VIDEO GAME MONITOR

               as a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often 
               leaving the road, much like Jack's libido.

               ZOOM OUT

               to reveal six-year-old SIENA seated in Jack's lap as they 
               drive together. A delighted Siena laughs and giggles.

               Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something, 
               two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL.

                                     CARYL
                         Stephanie's heard this a thousand 
                         times, but if I'd done what I wanted 
                         and I'd bought up in Santa Maria 
                         when I had the chance, I would have 
                         made a fortune when they put in that 
                         outlet center and that Home Depot.
                              (a drag off her 
                              cigarette, then to 
                              Stephanie)
                         Your father knew it too, but he was 
                         a fucking chickenshit. Always was.

               Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and 
               Siena, so completely happy together.

               Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches. Stephanie is 
               equally enthralled. Miles takes it all in, trying his best 
               not to shake his head in disgust.

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - DUSK

               Caryl is behind the wheel of her OLDSMOBILE as Stephanie 
               gets Siena buckled up in the backseat. Jack pulls Miles aside.

                                     JACK
                         Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph 
                         and Siena get home safe, and then 
                         maybe we'll hook up with you later, 
                         okay?

                                     MILES
                              (dispirited)
                         Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a 
                         movie.

               Stephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car 
               next to her mom.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         See you, Miles. You take care.

                                     MILES
                         Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.

                                     SIENA AND CARYL
                         Bye, Miles.

               As he gets in the car --

                                     JACK
                         Call me on my cell if you go out.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah.

               Miles watches them drive away, then heads toward his Saab.

               CLOSE ON THE COUNTER --

               BEEF JERKY and some TROPICAL FRUIT SKITTLES.

               WIDE --

               Miles points over the CASHIER'S SHOULDER.

                                     MILES
                         And could I get a Barely Leqal?

               As the cashier reaches for the magazine --

                                     MILES
                         NO, um, the new one.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Miles is once again FLOSSING.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               POP! Miles opens a bottle of Pinot and pours himself a glass. 
               He carries it to bed, takes a nice big slug, lies down on 
               the bed and opens his magazine.

               NOW SNEEZING ATOP THE BED -- ANGLE ON TOP OF HIM --

               The Barely Legal face down on his chest, Miles awakens with 
               a start and looks at the clock-radio. He thinks a moment, 
               takes a deep breath, and bounds off the bed.

               CLOSE ON A WATER-SAVER SHOWER HEAD --

               as little needles of water come at us.

               THROUGH THE BATHROOM DOOR --

               Miles takes a nice hot SHOWER. But wait -- he has forgotten 
               to put the shower curtain inside the tub. A closer look 
               reveals a growing PUDDLE OF WATER on the floor.

               EXT. THE HITCHING POST - NIGHT

               Miles walks across the parking lot. He pauses before entering, 
               then forces himself to take the leap.

               INT. THE HITCHING POST - NIGHT

               Miles affects nonchalance as he searches briefly for Maya. 
               He continues on into the BAR.

                                     GARY
                         How's it hanging, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         You know me. I love it up here. How 
                         about you?

                                     GARY
                         Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a 
                         busload of retired folks in on a 
                         wine tour. Usually they're not too 
                         rowdy, but tonight there was something 
                         going on. Full moon or something. 
                         What can I get you?

                                     MILES
                         Highliner.

                                     GARY
                         Glass or bottle?

                                     MILES
                              (considers, then --)
                         Bottle.

                                     GARY
                         You got it.

                                     MILES
                         Say, is Maya working?

                                     GARY
                         Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's 
                         off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?

               Miles just smiles.

               WIDE --

               Gary serves Miles, alone at the bar. Miles takes his first 
               drink.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, that's tasty.

               EXT. HITCHING POST - NIGHT

               It's closing time. The front door flies open, and Miles 
               staggers out sideways. Gary follows him out, concerned.

                                     GARY
                         You okay, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         I'm good.

               Miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes 
               his mistake and steers himself back toward the Windmill.

               FADE OUT.

               UNDER BLACK, A CARD --

                                        WEDNESDAY

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               The door bursts open, and Jack comes bounding in.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, dude. Let's go golfing! I 
                         got us in at Alisal.

               Miles comes to, very hungover.

                                     MILES
                         That's a public course.
                              (then --)
                         No Stephanie?

                                     JACK
                         She's working. I need a break anyway. 
                         She's getting a little clingy.
                              (magnanimous)
                         This is our day!

               EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

               WHACK! Jack TEES OFF with a manly athletic swing and shades 
               his eyes to watch the ball's trajectory.

                                     JACK
                         Crap.

               Miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks 
               a tee in the ground and sets his ball.

                                     JACK
                         Did you ever got ahold of Maya 
                         yesterday?

                                     MILES
                         Nope.

                                     JACK
                         She likes you, man. Stephanie'll 
                         tell you.

                                     MILES
                              (preparing to swing)
                         Can you give me some room here?

                                     JACK
                              (stepping back)
                         Oh yeah. Sure.

               Miles lifts his club.

                                     JACK
                         You know, in life you gotta strike 
                         when the iron's hot.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks, Jack.

               Miles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful 
               advice.

                                     JACK
                         Don't whiff it.

               WHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good, 
               long drive.

                                     JACK
                         Nice shot.

                                     MILES
                         You're an asshole.

               NOW ON THE FAIRWAY --

               Jack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to 
               take his next swing.

                                     JACK
                         What about your agent? Hear anything 
                         yet?

                                     MILES
                         Nope.

                                     JACK
                         What do you think's going on?

                                     MILES
                         Could be anything.

                                     JACK
                         Been checking your messages?

                                     MILES
                         Obsessively.

                                     JACK
                         Huh.

                                     MILES
                         They probably think my book is such 
                         a piece of shit that it's not even 
                         worthy of a response. I guess I'll 
                         just have to learn how to kiss off 
                         three years of my life.

                                     JACK
                         But you don't know yet, so your 
                         negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't 
                         you say?

               Miles says nothing.

                                     JACK
                         Or fuck those New York publishers. 
                         Publish it yourself. I'll chip in. 
                         Just get it out there, get it 
                         reviewed, get it in libraries. Let 
                         the public decide.

               Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's 
               talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses.

                                     JACK
                         Don't come over the top. Stay still.

                                     MILES
                         Shut up.

                                     JACK
                         Just trying to be helpful.
                              (a moment later)
                         It's all about stillness, Miles. 
                         Inner quiet.

               Miles drops his club and turns to Jack.

                                     MILES
                         Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's 
                         the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!

                                     JACK
                         Why are you so hostile? I know you're 
                         frustrated with your life right now, 
                         but you can choose not to be so 
                         hostile.
                              (holding out a cup of 
                              wine)
                         Here.

               Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a 
               taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes.

                                     MILES
                         What is it?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

               Miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste.

                                     MILES
                         Huh. Let me see the label.

               Suddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly 
               behind them.

                                     JACK
                              (whirling around)
                         What the fuck?

               Way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a FOURSOME 
               of two couples. One of the MEN is waving his driver.

                                     HUSBAND #1
                              (shouting, barely 
                              audible)
                         Hurry it up, will you?

               Jack looks at Miles, the two incredulous.

                                     MILES
                         Fucker hit into us.

                                     JACK
                              (yelling)
                         Hey, asshole! That's not cool!

                                     MILES
                         Throw me his ball.

               Jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it 
               to Miles. Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts 
               it back low and hard.

                                     JACK
                         Nice shot.

               THE COUPLES

               duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads.

               JACK AND MILES

               laugh hard.

               THE TWO HUSBANDS

               climb in their CART and hasten down the fairway toward Jack 
               and Miles.

               JACK

               watches their approach, grinning.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, this is going to be fun.
                              (jerking a driver 
                              from his bag)
                         This is going to be fun.

               Jack heads in their direction, brandishing the club like a 
               medieval knight with a mace.

               As the husbands get a look at this sight, they turn their 
               cart around and speed back toward their wives.

                                     JACK
                         Hit into us again, motherfuckers, 
                         and I'll ass-rape all four of you!

               EXT. GOLF COURSE CLUBHOUSE - DAY

               Jack and Miles are turning in their cart and hoisting their 
               clubs over their shoulders.

                                     JACK
                         Just don't give up on Maya. Cool 
                         smart chicks like that --they like 
                         persistence.

                                     MILES
                         I don't want to talk about it.

                                     JACK
                         All I know is she's beautiful. Lots 
                         of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not 
                         going to feel good about this trip 
                         until you guys hook up. Don't you 
                         just want to feel that cozy little 
                         box grip down on your Johnson?

               Nearby a GOLFER is with his YOUNG SON.

                                     GOLFER
                         Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?

               EXT. GOLF COURSE PARKING LOT - DAY

               Miles and Jack walk toward their car.

                                     JACK
                         Is it the money thing?

                                     MILES
                         Is what the money thing?

                                     JACK
                         With Maya.

                                     MILES
                         Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman 
                         finds out how I live, that I'm not a 
                         published author, that I'm a liar 
                         essentially, then yeah, any interest 
                         is gonna evaporate real quick. If 
                         you don't have money at my age, you're 
                         not even in the game. You're just a 
                         pasture animal waiting for the 
                         abattoir.

                                     JACK
                         Is an abattoir like a... like a... 
                         what is that?

                                     MILES
                         Slaughterhouse.

                                     JACK
                         Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to 
                         get the good news this week about 
                         your book. I know you are. I can 
                         feel it.

               Jack's CELLPHONE rings, and he checks the caller ID.

                                     JACK
                         It's Steph.
                              (picking up)
                         Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss. I 
                         mean I would, but let me see. Hey, 
                         Miles... Oh fuck it, we're going. 
                         We'll be right there. Me too.

               He snaps his phone shut and turns to Miles.

                                     JACK
                         We're on.

                                     MILES
                         What's happening?

                                     JACK
                         We're going to have some fun. Remember 
                         fun? We're going to have some of it. 
                         Okay?

                                     MILES
                         What exactly are we going to do?

                                     JACK
                         I said okay?

                                     MILES
                         You have to tell me --

                                     JACK
                         I SAID OKAY?

               Miles finally smiles.

                                     MILES
                         Okay.

               OMITTED

                                                 BIG FUN MUSIC BEGINS OVER:

               EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS OLIVOS - DAY

               A HIGH WIDE SHOT --

               The Saab pulls up where Stephanie and Maya await with bottles 
               of wine and a PICNIC BASKET. The girls climb into the back 
               seat, and the car speeds away.

               INT./EXT. THE SAAB - DAY

               They're going FAST, hair whipping around.

                                     MAYA
                         Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the 
                         restaurant last night looking for 
                         me.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped 
                         by for a drink. Didn't see you.

                                     MAYA
                         I had class.

                                     MILES
                         Well, nice to see you now.

                                     MAYA
                         You too.

               EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROAD - DAY

               WHOOSH! That car's going a little too FAST!

               INT./EXT. LA PURISIMA MISSION CHURCH

               The two couples wander around this historic site.

               EXT. IDYLLIC PICNIC SPOT - DAY INTO DUSK

               The girls have led them to a beautiful spot.

               IN A SERIES OF SHOTS --

               we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but 
               there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even 
               Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness 
               from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other 
               as they eat and sip wine.

               Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET.

               EXT. WINERY #3 PARKING LOT - EVENING

               The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed 
               toward the main building.

               INT. WINERY #3 - EVENING

               A LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress. 
               He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the 
               few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention.

               IN THE AUDIENCE --

               As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles.

                                     JACK
                         You ever actually read any of this 
                         guy's books?

                                     MILES
                         He wrote a great one on Burgundy, 
                         and I used to get his newsletter, 
                         but then there were doubts about 
                         whether he does all his own tasting. 
                         Plus a couple of times he declared 
                         certain years vintages of the century, 
                         and they turned out to be turkeys. 
                         Fucker never retracted.

                                     JACK
                         Huh.

               Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a 
               GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles 
               protests at first, they stand and leave.

               AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM --

               Stephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is 
               open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside --

               INT. WINEMAKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               This is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless 
               steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS.

               As the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are 
               entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away.

               LATER --

               In the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank, 
               kissing.

               CAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in 
               the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge 
               of kissing but holding back.

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES...

               INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               THREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table.

               WIDE --

               The four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table. 
               They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in 
               LAUGHTER.

               A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes. 
               Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his 
               arms, and takes her back to bed.

               EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Saab pulls away from the house.

               INT. SAAB - NIGHT

               Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand 
               at the Saab.

               EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little 
               woozy from the hours of drinking.

               AT THE DOOR --

               Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles 
               hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear?

               Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans 
               forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is 
               immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long 
               KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes 
               the door in our face.

               The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS.

                                           MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH --

                                         THURSDAY

               The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a 
               blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand 
               picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to -- 

               INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               It is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste.

               Maya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops 
               the paper on the dining table and continues into --

               THE BEDROOM --

               where Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly 
               face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly.

               Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot.

               EXT. FARMERS' MARKET - DAY

               This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic 
               produce, candles and incense, honey and cider.

               Maya and Miles are shopping. Miles carries the bags.

               EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

               Across from each other at a PICNIC TABLE, and surrounded by 
               the remnants of BREAKFAST, Miles and Maya read the NEWSPAPER. 
               Miles is doing the CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

                                     MAYA
                         You guys should stop by the restaurant 
                         for lunch today.

                                     MILES
                         Great. What's the latest we can get 
                         there?

                                     MAYA
                         About two-thirty.

                                     MILES
                         Okay.

                                     MAYA
                              (noticing)
                         Did you hear about this Bordeaux 
                         tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara 
                         Saturday night? It's a little pricey, 
                         but if you wanted to go, I'd be into 
                         it. Why don't you stay through the 
                         weekend?

               Miles has just figured out a difficult clue. As he writes it 
               down --

                                     MILES
                         No, we've got to get back Friday for 
                         the rehearsal dinner.

                                     MAYA
                         What rehearsal dinner?

               Miles stops writing.

                                     MAYA
                         Who's getting married?

               INT./EXT. PARKING AREA NEAR THE ORCHARD - DAY

               Maya leads the way toward the Saab.

                                     MAYA
                         Were you ever going to say anything?

                                     MILES
                         Of course I was. I mean, just now I 
                         could have made up some story, but I 
                         didn't. I told you the truth.

               Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break." 
               Miles reaches out to touch her.

                                     MILES
                         Maya.

                                     MAYA
                              (jerking away)
                         Don't touch me. Just take me home.

               INT. SAAB - DAY

               Miles drives, glancing occasionally at Maya, who stares 
               straight ahead.

                                     MILES
                         I've told him. I've told him over 
                         and over, but he's out of control.

                                     MAYA
                         Do you know what he's been saying to 
                         her?

                                     MILES
                         He's an actor, so it can't be good.

                                     MAYA
                         Oh, just that he loves her. That 
                         she's the only woman who has ever 
                         really rocked his world. How he adores 
                         Siena. How he wants to move up here 
                         and get a place with the two of them 
                         and commute when he has to.

                                     MILES
                         I'm sure he believed every word.

               A stony silence.

                                     MILES
                         Please believe me. I was even on the 
                         verge of telling you last night, 
                         but...

                                     MAYA
                         But you wanted to fuck me first.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, Maya. No.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah.

               EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Miles brings the car to a stop. Maya opens the door and begins 
               to get out.

                                     MAYA
                         You know, I just spent three years 
                         trying to extricate myself from a 
                         relationship that turned out to be 
                         full of deception. And I've been 
                         doing just fine.

                                     MILES
                         And I haven't been with anyone since 
                         my divorce. This has been a big deal 
                         for me, Maya -- hanging out with 
                         you, and last night. I really like 
                         you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm 
                         just his... his freshman roommate 
                         from San Diego State.

               Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't 
               just yet.

                                     MAYA
                         Could I have my paper, please?

               Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back 
               seat for the New York Times. He hands it to her and watches 
               until she goes inside.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               Miles pulls up and parks.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               As Miles enters, a shirtless Jack drops the Barely Legal and 
               is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big BEARHUG. The 
               TV is on, perhaps showing an E! True Hollywood Story.

                                     JACK
                         Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my 
                         boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is 
                         yo' daddy?

                                     MILES
                         Put me down, Jack.

               Jack continues his paean to Miles's triumphant night.

                                     MILES
                         I said put me down. Jack!

               Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of 
               them onto the bed. Now on top of Miles, Jack KISSES both 
               cheeks.

                                     JACK
                         I'm so proud of you! Let me love 
                         you!

               Now they get up off the bed.

                                     JACK
                         So tell me everything. Details. I 
                         like details.

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     JACK
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         It's private.

                                     JACK
                         You're kidding, right? Tell me what 
                         happened, you fucker, or I'll tie 
                         your dick in a knot.

                                     MILES
                         Let's leave it alone.

               Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension.

                                     JACK
                         You didn't get any, did you?
                              (off Miles's silence)
                         You're a homo.

                                     MILES
                         Just stop, okay? Make something up, 
                         and that's what happened. Whatever 
                         you want. Write my confession, and 
                         I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me 
                         all the time! I can't take it! You're 
                         an infant! This is all a big party 
                         for you, but not for me! This is 
                         serious. And you -- Just... leave me 
                         alone, okay? You're fucking me up.

                                     JACK
                         Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.

               Miles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and 
               sensitively puts one arm around his friend.

                                     JACK
                         Did you have trouble performing? 
                         Yeah, that's...

                                     MILES
                         Shut up! Shut up, Jack!

               The phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the 
               ominous sound.

                                     MILES
                         Don't answer it.

               But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game 
               of Russian roulette.

                                     MILES
                         I'm telling you, don't.

               Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.

                                     JACK
                         Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? 
                         Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
                              (mouthing)
                         Christine.

               Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. 
               His face is dark with resentment.

                                     JACK
                         Listen, honey. Let me call you back. 
                         Miles and I are in the middle of 
                         something. No, it's nothing serious -- 
                         Miles is just having one of his freak-
                         outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call 
                         you right back.

               Jack hangs up.

                                     MILES
                         This whole week has gone sour. It 
                         isn't turning out like it was supposed 
                         to.
                              (deadly serious)
                         I want to go home.

                                     JACK
                         Who's being selfish now? I'm the one 
                         getting married. I thought this week 
                         was supposed to be about me.

                                     MILES
                         We gotta slow down.
                              (closing his eyes)
                         I'm so tired. Let's just get out of 
                         here.

                                     JACK
                         I know what you need.

               INT. SEARS - DAY

               Jack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE 
               ties Miles's laces.

                                     SALES ASSOCIATE
                         There you go.

               Miles gets up and walks in a circle.

                                     MILES
                         Do you like them?

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're 
                         really sporty.

                                     MILES
                         Are they too sporty?

               INT. MALL - DAY

               The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying 
               a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle.

                                     JACK
                         Feel better?

               Miles shrugs.

                                     JACK
                              (noticing something)
                         Oh here, wait a second. I want to 
                         run in here real quick.

               He heads toward a TOYS STORE.

                                     JACK
                              (over his shoulder)
                         I want to get something for Siena.

               Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They 
               pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to 
               turn in.

                                     JACK
                         How about this one? We didn't hit 
                         this one.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.

                                     JACK
                         You ever actually been in there, 
                         Miles?

                                     MILES
                         I don't have to.

                                     JACK
                              (turning the wheel)
                         I say we check it out. You never 
                         know.

               EXT. LARGE WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY

               The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS, 
               whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of 
               letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly.

               INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

               The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display 
               after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate 
               sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the 
               winery's logo.

               In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays 
               soothing Windham Hill-ish music.

               The tasting bar is packed three-deep with TASTERS attended 
               to by HARRIED POURERS.

               Finally the POURER gets to their glasses. Miles chews a sip 
               and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.

                                     MILES
                         Tastes like the back of a fucking LA 
                         schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, 
                         hoping for some semblance of 
                         concentration, crushed it up with 
                         leaves and mice, wound up with this 
                         rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash 
                         bullshit. Fucking Raid.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Tastes okay to me.
                              (looking at the tasting 
                              sheet)
                         Hey, they got a reserve pinot.

                                     MILES
                         Let me use your phone.

                                     JACK
                              (handing it over)
                         What's up?

                                     MILES
                         I can't take it anymore. I've got to 
                         call Evelyn.

               EXT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

               Walking across the lawn outside, Miles holds the cellphone 
               to his ear.

                                     ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)
                         Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.

                                     MILES
                         Hi, it's Miles.

                                     ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)
                         Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can 
                         get her.
                              (a moment later)
                         You're in luck. I'll put you through.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite 
                         client.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         How's the trip?

                                     MILES
                         Good, good. Drinking some good wines 
                         and kicking back, you know. So what's 
                         happening? Still no word?

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         Actually there is word. I spoke to 
                         Keith Kurtzman this morning.

                                     MILES
                         And?

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         And... they're passing. Conundrum's 
                         passing. He said they really liked 
                         it. They really wanted to do it, but 
                         they just couldn't figure out how to 
                         market it. He said it was a tough 
                         call.

                                     MILES
                         Huh.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         I'm sorry, Miles.
                              (off his silence)
                         So I don't know where that leaves 
                         us. I'm not sure how much more mileage 
                         I can get out of continuing to submit 
                         it. I think it's one of those 
                         unfortunate cases in the business 
                         right now -- a fabulous book with no 
                         home. The whole industry's gotten 
                         gutless. It's not about the quality 
                         of the books. It's about the 
                         marketing.

               Miles is at a loss for words. A distant RUMBLE begins to 
               sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.

               EXT. DEEP CANYON - INSERT

               Once again we see the narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending 
               vertiginously across a great CHASM.

               EXT. LARGE WINERY - BACK AGAIN

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         Are you there? Miles?

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I'm here.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. 
                         You've been a real trooper.
                              (loudly, to her 
                              assistant)
                         Tell him I'll call back.

                                     MILES
                         So I guess that's it.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         You're a wonderful writer, Miles. 
                         Don't be discouraged.

               MOMENTS LATER --

               Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax 
               and downing a couple, as Evelyn's clichés of consolation 
               continue in his head.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         Just hang in there, and who knows? 
                         After you get something else 
                         published, we can revisit this one. 
                         And next time we can try a different 
                         title.

               Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt 
               to steady himself. The RUMBLE grows deafening.

               INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

               Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds 
               and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting 
               station. He pushes his way to front.

               The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop. Miles jacks it 
               back, immediately extending his glass for more.

                                     MILES
                         Hit me again.

               The same small amount is poured and downed. Once again Miles 
               holds out his glass.

                                     MILES
                         Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for 
                         it.

                                     POURER
                         This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.

               Miles slams a TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL on the table.

                                     MILES
                         Just give me a full goddamn pour.

               The pourer turns away to serve another party. Miles looks 
               around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic 
               to this injustice.

               Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right 
               up to the brim and beyond.

                                     POURER
                         Sir, what are you doing?

                                     MILES
                         I told you I need a drink.

                                     POURER
                         Then buy a bottle and go outside.

               The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink.

                                     POURER
                         Put the glass down.

               In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby 
               steps back.

                                     POURER
                         You're going to have to leave, sir.

               The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door. Across the 
               room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over.

               Miles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts 
               to GUZZLE it. Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto 
               his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes.

               The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags 
               him toward the EXIT. Jack catches up.

                                     JACK
                              (to the horrified 
                              onlookers)
                         It's all right. His mother just died.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY

               Two PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES, 
               crashing into the water and disappearing from view.

               Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the 
               ocean, sharing a bottle of wine.

                                     JACK
                         Just write another one. You have 
                         lots of ideas, right?

                                     MILES
                         No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. 
                         I'm a middle-school English teacher. 
                         I'm going to spend the rest of my 
                         life grading essays and reading the 
                         works of others. It's okay. I like 
                         books. The world doesn't give a shit 
                         what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.
                              (a dark laugh)
                         I'm so insignificant, I can't even 
                         kill myself.

                                     JACK
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     MILES
                         You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, 
                         Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't 
                         kill yourself before you've even 
                         been published.

                                     JACK
                         What about that guy who wrote 
                         Confederacy of Dunces? He committed 
                         suicide before he got published, and 
                         look how famous he is.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks.

                                     JACK
                         Don't give up. You're going to make 
                         it.

                                     MILES
                         Half my life is over, and I have 
                         nothing to show for it. I'm a 
                         thumbprint on the window of a 
                         skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement 
                         on a tissue surging out to sea with 
                         a million tons of raw sewage.

                                     JACK
                         See? Right there. Just what you just 
                         said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint 
                         on a skyscraper. I couldn't write 
                         that.

                                     MILES
                         Neither could I. I think it's 
                         Bukowski.

               Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach.

               EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

               ZOOM! There goes the Saab.

               The CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG, 
               now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot.

                                     JACK
                              (lighting up)
                         Oh, look. There's Steph!

               He smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see --

               STEPHANIE

               seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her 
               lap, watching patiently as --

               THE SAAB

               pulls to a stop in a parking space.

               Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches 
               in the backseat for his Sears bag.

                                     JACK
                              (calling out)
                         Hey, baby.

               Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack 
               reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL.

                                     JACK
                         Look what I got for our favorite 
                         girl.

               Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging 
               the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms 
               with rage.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

               She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.

               Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands 
               over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he 
               rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed 
               lion.

               Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out 
               of range.

                                     MILES
                         Stephanie! Stop!

                                     STEPHANIE
                         You fucking bastard! Lying piece of 
                         shit! You're getting married on 
                         Saturday? What was all that shit you 
                         said to me?

                                     JACK
                         I can explain.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         You said you loved me! You fuck! I 
                         hope you die!

               With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet, 
               she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Fuckface!
                              (to Miles)
                         You too!

               As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded 
               friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses 
               a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.

                                     MILES
                         Aren't you glad you didn't move up 
                         here and marry her?

                                     JACK
                         Don't need a lecture. You fucking 
                         told Maya, didn't you?

                                     MILES
                         No, I did not. Must have been Gary 
                         at the Hitching Post. I think we 
                         mentioned it to him the first night.

                                     JACK
                         You told him. I'm fucking hurting 
                         here.

                                     MILES
                         Keep it elevated.

               INT. HOSPITAL ER WAITING ROOM - DAY

               CLOSE ON A COSMOPOLITAN open to an article titled "24 Ways 
               To Please Your Man."

               WIDER --

               Miles reads, while nearby a YOUNG BOY dry-heaves into a 
               garbage can held by his FATHER. An OLD WOMAN parked in a 
               wheelchair faces the wall.

               LATER --

               Miles is at a PAYPHONE. As he speaks he tries to peel off 
               the metal LONG DISTANCE STICKER.

                                     MAYA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.

                                     MILES
                         It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if 
                         you even care, but I had to call and 
                         tell you again how much I enjoyed 
                         our time together and how sorry I am 
                         things turned out the way they did. 
                         I think you're great, Maya -- always 
                         have. From the first time you waited 
                         on me.
                              (bracing himself)
                         And while I'm at it, I guess you 
                         should know that my book is not 
                         getting published. I thought this 
                         one had a chance, but I was wrong. 
                         Again. Don't bother reading it -- 
                         you've got better things to do. So 
                         you see I'm not much of a writer. 
                         I'm not anything really. The only 
                         real talent I seem to have is for 
                         disappointing people and now you 
                         know that firsthand. We're leaving 
                         in the morning, and I want you to 
                         know that I take with me wonderful 
                         memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really 
                         sorry.

               What else to say? He hangs up.

               He returns to his seat. A moment later he extends his legs 
               to look at his new SHOES now STAINED WITH WINE.

               LATER --

               Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency 
               room, his face purple and swollen beneath the HUGE WHITE 
               BANDAGE that holds the NOSEGUARD in place. Miles walks with 
               him toward the exit.

                                     MILES
                         Well?

                                     JACK
                         I'm going to need an operation. Maybe 
                         a couple of them. They have to wait 
                         for it it to heal first. Then they 
                         break it again.

                                     MILES
                         Good thing you have a voice-over 
                         career.

                                     JACK
                         Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue 
                         her ass. Only reason I won't is to 
                         protect Christine.

                                     MILES
                         That's thoughtful.

                                     JACK
                              (disgusted)
                         Yeah.

               They walk by us and out the door.

               EXT. STREET IN SOLVANG - DAY

               Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost 
               fully reclined. When his agony allows him to open his eyes, 
               he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street. An 
               ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window. 
               He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see 
               a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed 
               in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA. Jack 
               takes a slug of wine.

               Just then Miles gets back in the car.

                                     JACK
                         I hate this place.

               Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills. 
               A closer angle reveals them as VICODIN.

                                     MILES
                         Take a couple of these, and you'll 
                         learn to love it.

               Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two PILLS.

                                     MILES
                         Two for you. And two for me.

               Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles, 
               who follows suit.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - EVENING

               Jack and Miles sit across from each other. For the first 
               time we see LARGE PURPLE BRUISES on Jack's arms and chest.

                                     JACK
                         So how did Stephanie know it was 
                         Saturday? We didn't get into that 
                         with Gary.

                                     MILES
                         Huh. Let me think.

                                     JACK
                         You sure you didn't say anything to 
                         Maya?

                                     MILES
                         Sure I'm sure. And just what are you 
                         implying? I'm really pissed off at 
                         you about all this, if you want to 
                         know the truth. What's Maya going to 
                         think of me now just for associating 
                         with you? You're the one who's 
                         sabotaging me, not the other way 
                         around, pal. Not by a longshot.

               Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Just seems fishy.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               The boys lie on their respective beds staring at the TV. 
               Jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser MIRROR like a 
               large dog who has just been neutered.

                                     JACK
                         What's it look like to you?

                                     MILES
                         Looks like you were in a bad car 
                         accident.

               Jack turns to Miles, nodding and thinking. Then he looks 
               back in the mirror.

                                     JACK
                         I'm hungry.

               EXT. A.J. SPURS BARBECUE - NIGHT

               Establishing. Thursday night is Cajun Wings Night.

               INT. A.J. SPURS BARBECUE - NIGHT

               Miles and Jack are finishing their SALADS in the rustic- 
               themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies.

                                     JACK
                         You know what I'm thinking?

                                     MILES
                         What's that?

                                     JACK
                         I'm thinking it's time to settle 
                         down. One woman. One house. You know. 
                         It's time.

                                     MILES
                         Uh-huh.

               Jack nods his head with no self-awareness or acknowledgment 
               of the irony.

               NOW TWO PLATES ARRIVE

               mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter-whipped mashed 
               potatoes.

                                     JACK
                         Mm. Mm.

               Their cheery, saftig blonde WAITRESS removes several FOIL 
               PACKETS from her apron and places them on the table.

                                     WAITRESS
                         And here're your Handi-wipes.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, so that's what those are? For a 
                         second there I thought you guys were 
                         promoting safe sex.

               The waitress OVER-LAUGHS and swipes a hand at her naughty 
               customer.

                                     WAITRESS
                         I'll be right back with more corn 
                         bread.

               Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles.

                                     JACK
                         I bet you that chick is two tons of 
                         fun. You know, the grateful type.

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. I wouldn't know.

               Now she comes back toward the table carrying a BIG BASKET. 
               Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons SH-SH-SH as she walks. 
               When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket 
               using big TONGS. Jack watches attentively.

                                     JACK
                         Nice technique there...
                              (checking her name 
                              tag)
                         ...Cammi.

                                     CAMMI
                         It's all in the wrist.
                              (a moment later)
                         You know, you look really familiar. 
                         You from around here? Where'd you go 
                         to high school?

                                     JACK
                         No, we're from San Diego. Why?

                                     CAMMI
                         I don't know. You just seem really 
                         familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy 
                         your meals.

                                     JACK
                         Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek 
                         Sommersby?

                                     CAMMI
                         Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean 
                         from "One Life to Live"?

               Miles looks away and sighs.

                                     JACK
                         You have to imagine him with a bandage 
                         and shorter hair.

               As Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment.

                                     CAMMI
                         No. Way. No way!

               Jack smiles and nods.

                                     CAMMI
                         Oh, my God!

                                     MILES
                         Could you tell me where the bathroom 
                         is?

                                     CAMMI
                              (her eyes barely 
                              leaving Jack)
                         Uh, sure, it's right over there, 
                         right past the buffalo.

               IN A WIDE SHOT --

               Miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's 
               flirtation with Cammi continues.

               The camera PANS with Miles as he walks by us and goes through 
               the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame 
               with the word "MEN."

               LATER --

               A TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense 
               one.

               WIDER --

               Miles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he 
               watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way.

                                     JACK
                         She gets off in an hour, so I think 
                         I'm just going to have a drink and 
                         then... make sure she gets home safe.

                                     MILES
                         You're joking, right?
                              (seeing that he isn't)
                         What are you doing? Un-fucking-
                         believeable. Can we just go back to 
                         the hotel and hang out and get up 
                         early and play nine holes before we 
                         head home?

               Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, 
               thinking how best to put it.

                                     JACK
                         Look, Miles. I know you're my friend 
                         and you care about me. And I know 
                         you disapprove. I respect that. But 
                         there are some things I have to do 
                         that you don't understand. You 
                         understand wine and literature and 
                         movies, but you don't understand my 
                         plight. And that's okay.

               CLOSE ON MILES --

               as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               UNDER BLACK, SUPERIMPOSED --

                                          FRIDAY

               Now comes the sound of hysterical KNOCKING.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

               Despite the knocking, Miles remains motionless in bed, his 
               expression serene.

               Finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening 
               it to find --

               JACK

               silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn. He is 
               barefoot. In fact he is clad only in his UNDERWEAR. Hugging 
               himself, he PANTS and SHIVERS.

                                     JACK
                         Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing.

               He limps past Miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them 
               around himself.

                                     JACK
                         Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My 
                         nose.

               Miles hands him the bottle, and Jack frantically pops a couple 
               of pills, chewing them like candy. He sits down and bends 
               over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash.

                                     JACK
                         Fucking chick's married.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         Her husband works a night shift or 
                         something, and he comes home, and 
                         I'm on the floor with my cock in his 
                         wife's ass.

                                     MILES
                         Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked 
                         all the way back from Solvang?

                                     JACK
                         Ran. Twisted my ankle too.

                                     MILES
                         That's five clicks, Jackson.

                                     JACK
                         Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one 
                         point I had to cut through an ostrich 
                         farm. Fuckers are mean.

               Miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole 
               scene, and he LAUGHS HARD. The blanketed bulge just sits 
               there. Finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage.

                                     JACK
                         We gotta go back.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         I left my wallet. My credit cards, 
                         cash, fucking ID, everything. We 
                         gotta go back.

                                     MILES
                         Big deal. We'll call right now and 
                         cancel your cards.

                                     JACK
                         You don't understand. The wedding 
                         bands. The wedding bands are in my 
                         wallet.

                                     MILES
                         Okay, so they were in your wallet, 
                         and you left your wallet somewhere. 
                         Some bar. Christine'll understand.

                                     JACK
                         No. She ordered them special. Took 
                         her forever to find them. They've 
                         got this design on them with dolphins 
                         and our names engraved in Sanskrit. 
                         We've got to go back. Christine'll 
                         fucking crucify me.

                                     MILES
                         No way. No way.

                                     JACK
                              (a pitiful whine)
                         Please, Miles, please.

                                     MILES
                         Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at 
                         a bar. Happens every day.

               Jack stares straight ahead, breathing through his mouth as 
               he considers this. Then --

                                     JACK
                         No, we've got to get my wallet! Those 
                         rings are irreplaceable! We've got 
                         to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I 
                         know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up. 
                         You gotta help me. You gotta help 
                         me. Pleeeease!

               Jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation 
               that Miles has never seen before in Jack, or in anyone else 
               for that matter.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know 
                         I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing. 
                         Help me, Miles. Just this one thing, 
                         this one last thing. I can't lose 
                         Christine. I can't. I'm nothing 
                         without her. Please, Miles, please... 
                         uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......

               No longer able to form words, Jack is reduced to emitting 
               low, primitive sounds. Snot flows from beneath his bandaged 
               nose.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING

               Miles drives in the early-morning light. Jack is now subdued, 
               quieted by his pain and exhaustion.

                                     MILES
                         She tell you she was married?

                                     JACK
                         Yeah.

                                     MILES
                         So what the fuck were you thinking?

                                     JACK
                         Wasn't supposed to be back till six. 
                         Fucker rolls in at five.

                                     MILES
                         Cutting it a little close, don't you 
                         think?
                              (off Jack's silence)
                         So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, 
                         say.

                                     JACK
                         Horny as shit. Flopping around like 
                         a landed trout.

               EXT. LOW-RENT STREET - MORNING

               The Saab creeps around a corner.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING

               Jack scans the street.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, this is the block. Just keep 
                         going...
                              (spotting an AMC Pacer)
                         Yeah! This is it. There's her car.

               Miles pulls over and cuts the engine.

                                     MILES
                         So what's the plan?

                                     JACK
                         The plan is... you go.

                                     MILES
                         Me?

                                     JACK
                         My ankle. Just go explain the 
                         situation.

                                     MILES
                              (sarcastic, clearing 
                              his throat)
                         Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend 
                         was the one balling your wife a couple 
                         hours ago, and he seems to have left 
                         his wallet behind, and we were 
                         wondering...

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like 
                         that.

               Miles gives Jack a withering look. Jack reaches for the DOOR 
               HANDLE.

                                     JACK
                         Fuck you. I'll get it myself.

                                     MILES
                              (grabbing Jack's shirt)
                         Hold on.

               EXT. CAMMI'S STREET - MORNING

               Miles crosses the street and approaches --

               EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Miles presses his ear against the front door. Nothing. Then 
               he notices --

               A SLIDING GLASS DOOR a few feet away, just barely cracked 
               open.

               MILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and 
               pulls back the curtain to reveal --

               A LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed 
               beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S.

               Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass 
               door, and creeps inside.

               INT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               A furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals NOTHING. Then 
               Miles notices a HIGH-PITCHED SOUND wafting from an open door 
               down a short HALLWAY.

               Miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the 
               floor. Again nothing. Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom 
               grows louder -- female MOANING in odd rhythmic unison with a 
               MAN'S VOICE.

               IN THE HALLWAY --

               Miles gets on ALL FOURS and starts crawling, weaving his way 
               through a trail of shoes and clothes.

               Nearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct --

                                     MAN
                         You don't think I fuck you, bitch? 
                         I'll fuck you.

                                     CAMMI
                         I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.

               Miles peers around the corner of the open door to see --

               INT. CAMMI'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Cammi is TIED to the faux brass headboard. A BIG GUY slams 
               away at her. In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL 
               PRESS CONFERENCE.

                                     MAN
                         You picked him up and you fucked 
                         him, didn't you, bitch?

                                     CAMMI
                         I picked him up and I fucked him. 
                         I'm a bad girl.

                                     MAN
                         And you liked fucking him, didn't 
                         you, you fat little whore?

                                     CAMMI
                         I liked it when you caught me fucking 
                         him.

               Whoa!

               Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature 
               documentary and scan the room.

               IRIS IN --

               to the WALLET atop the dresser.

               Miles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the 
               wallet. His HEART BEATING LOUDLY, he goes for it. He scrambles 
               to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and 
               tears out. Behind him he hears -- 

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         The fuck was that?

                                     CAMMI (O.S.)
                         The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!

               EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed 
               swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's 
               fast for a man his size.

                                     CAMMI (O.S.)
                         Get him!

               INT. SAAB - MORNING

               Jack is reclined in the passenger seat FAST ASLEEP. On the 
               radio NPR'S CARL KASSEL reads the news.

               THROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW --

               Miles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's 
               naked husband. Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks 
               loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake.

                                     MILES
                         Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn 
                         door!

               Jack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get 
               in before --

               WHUMP! The guy's BELLY hits the window. He pounds on the 
               roof before trying the door, now re-locked.

                                     MAN
                         You motherfuckers! I'll kill you! 
                         I'll kill you motherfuckers!

               Miles starts the car and begins to drive away. The guy tries 
               to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt. Jack turns 
               to look --

               OUT THE BACK WINDOW --

               The guy recedes in the distance.

               JACK

               removes the rings from the wallet.

                                     JACK
                         You did it! You fucking did it!

               They LAUGH and SLAP HANDS.

               CLOSE ON MILES --

               For all his failures, this time he did something right.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               The shades are drawn. Jack is CRASHED OUT on the bed, snoring 
               loudly. Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his 
               bags for departure.

               At one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep.

               A KNOCK at the door. Miles goes to answer it, but once his 
               hand is on the knob, he pauses. If we're perceptive, we will 
               know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya.

               He opens it. It's just the MAID with her big CART.

                                     MAID
                         Housekeeping.

               OMIT.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               The Saab enters the freeway and heads south.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               Miles drives while Jack stares out the window, WATCHING THE 
               LANDSCAPE CHANGE as they leave wine country.

                                     MILES
                         Hey, Jack. Jack.

                                     JACK
                         Hrnrnrn?

                                     MILES
                         That was quite a day yesterday.

               Jack's eyes close, but his lips spread into a smile.

                                     JACK
                         Yep. Quite a day.

                                     MILES
                         Quite a week.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               A driving shot.

               EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY

               Miles pumps the gas, while nearby Jack stretches his legs. 
               As Miles puts the nozzle back in place --

                                     JACK
                         Want me to drive?

                                     MILES
                         No, I'm okay.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, why don't you invite Maya to 
                         the wedding?

                                     MILES
                         Somehow I don't think inviting Maya 
                         to your wedding is the right move. 
                         In fact, after your bullshit, it's 
                         going to be hard for me to even go 
                         to the Hitching Post again.

                                     JACK
                         You're so negative.

               Miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, let me drive.

                                     MILES
                         I'm fine. You rest.

                                     JACK
                         I feel like driving.

               INT. SAAB - DAY

               As the car makes its way back toward the freeway, Jack looks 
               over at Miles and slows the car to a stop.

                                     MILES
                         What's wrong?

                                     JACK
                         Nothing. Buckle up, okay?

               Miles obeys. Without hesitation, Jack accelerates and JUMPS 
               THE CURB, heading into --

               EXT. VACANT LOT - CONTINUOUS

               The Saab plows INTO A TREE.

               INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

                                     MILES
                         What the fuck!

                                     JACK
                              (pointing at his face)
                         You said it looked like a car 
                         accident.

                                     MILES
                         What the fuck!

                                     JACK
                         I'll pay for it.

               EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY

               They get out to inspect the damage. The hood is slightly 
               crumpled, and the front fender is bent.

                                     MILES
                         Look at this!

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Doesn't look like 
                         anybody got hurt in this one.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.

                                     JACK
                         You need a new car anyway.

               Miles looks at his friend, incredulous.

                                     JACK
                         I said I'd pay for it.

               MOMENTS LATER --

               The trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of 
               wine. Miles notices that one box is DRIPPING.

                                     MILES
                         You broke some.

                                     JACK
                         Whatever. Sorry.

                                     MILES
                         No, not whatever. You fucking 
                         derelict.

               MOMENTS LATER --

               Miles looks on as Jack hoists a FOUNDATION BLOCK toward the 
               open driver's door of the Saab.

                                     JACK
                         You ready?

               Miles waves his hand in a gesture of "Get it over with."

               Grunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops 
               the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL.

               Direct hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in 
               time.

               Miles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the 
               tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the 
               car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, fuck!

               The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the 
               tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally 
               toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the 
               car remains visible.

               The whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still 
               frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other.

                                     JACK
                         It's okay. I've got Triple A.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               From in front of the Saab, we see its now CRUMPLED HOOD and 
               FENDER, a couple of BUNGEE CORDS holding the whole thing 
               together.

               EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY

               The Saab approaches the end of the line.

               EXT. ERGANIAN HOUSE --DAY

               AT THE FRONT PORCH --

               Miles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops 
               the last case down.

                                     MILES
                         Well. That about does it.

                                     JACK
                         Why don't you come in?

                                     MILES
                         Uh-uh. You're on your own.

                                     JACK
                         So I'll see you at the rehearsal.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah.

               They give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug.

                                     JACK
                         Love you, man.

                                     MILES
                         Back at you.

               Miles heads toward the curb.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, don't pull away till they see 
                         the car.

                                     MILES
                              (over his shoulder)
                         Yeah.
                              (turning around)
                         Hey, why wasn't I injured?

                                     JACK
                              (big smile)
                         You were wearing your belt.

               BACK AT HIS CAR --

               Miles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs. 
               Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock 
               and dismay. Jack points back at --

               MILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly 
               MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch --

               JACK --

               weaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants 
               to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the 
               door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to 
               get a better look.

               VERY CLOSE ON MILES --

               watching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he 
               momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is 
               interrupted by --

               THE VOICE OF AN ARMENIAN PRIEST

               Startled, Miles turns to look at --

               A PRIEST

               who is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS.

               We are now in --

               INT. ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH - DAY

               The church is packed.

               CLOSE ON THE RINGS as the priest holds them aloft.

               If those rings could talk... Jack shoots a quick look at 
               Miles, who looks right back. The priest continues his 
               blessing.

               EXT. ARMENIAN CHURCH - DAY

               AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS --

               The WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING 
               LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as 
               the new groom.

               AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS --

               Miles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then --

                                     VICTORIA (O.S.)
                         Hey, Miles.

               Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step 
               above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the 
               quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played 
               college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing 
               vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.

                                     MILES
                         Hi, Vicki.
                              (taking her in)
                         You look beautiful.

                                     VICTORIA
                         Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my 
                         husband.

               From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers 
               his hand.

                                     KEN
                         How are you?

                                     MILES
                         Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky 
                         guy.

                                     KEN
                         Thanks.
                              (to Victoria)
                         I'll wait for you at the car.
                              (to Miles)
                         Nice to meet you, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Ken.

               Exit Ken.

                                     MILES
                         That was big of him.

                                     VICTORIA
                         Yeah, he's good that way. Very 
                         considerate.

                                     MILES
                         That's great.

                                     VICTORIA
                         So how're you doing?

                                     MILES
                         Since the last time we spoke? I don't 
                         know. Could be better. Could be worse.

                                     VICTORIA
                         So what's happening with your book?

                                     MILES
                         Universally rejected. Strike three.

                                     VICTORIA
                         Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are 
                         you going to do?

                                     MILES
                         Back to the drawing board, I guess. 
                         Or not. So... you're married. 
                         Congratulations. You look happy.

                                     VICTORIA
                         I am.

                                     MILES
                         Seems like everyone's getting married. 
                         A year ago it was all divorces. Now 
                         it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.

                                     VICTORIA
                         I guess.

               Just then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the 
               curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the 
               sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives 
               Ken a little wave.

                                     MILES
                              (shifting gears)
                         Well, let's go have some champagne, 
                         shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.

                                     VICTORIA
                         Not me. I'm not drinking.

                                     MILES
                         You quit drinking?

                                     VICTORIA
                         I'm pregnant.

                                     MILES
                              (hit in the solar 
                              plexus)
                         Oh. Huh. Well...
                              (rallying)
                         Congratulations again, Vicki. That's 
                         wonderful news.

                                     VICTORIA
                              (going to the car)
                         See you over there, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah.

               As she gets in the car and cruises away, Miles glances back 
               at --

               THE RECEIVING LINE

               -- where Mike Erganian is introducing Jack to some dear old 
               FRIENDS. Mike throws a loving arm around his new son-in-law, 
               and Jack is drawn into Mike's bosom.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               A HAND-PAINTED SIGN, attached to a STOP SIGH and decorated 
               with balloons, reads: "RECEPTION THIS WAY!" with an arrow 
               pointing RIGHT.

               One by one, CARS are making a right turn. But when his turn 
               comes, Miles turns LEFT.

               EXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

               The Saab pull up outside. Miles leaves the car idling as he 
               sprints inside. Moments later he sprints back to his car, 
               this time carrying SOMETHING.

               OMIT

               INT. FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY

               His bowtie undone, Miles sits at a booth eating. He washes 
               down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax-coated 
               soft drink cup.

               He brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a BOTTLE OF 
               WINE hidden next to him. As he sets the bottle back down, we 
               glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc.

               He takes another sip. As the camera MOVES CLOSER, all the 
               complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across Miles's 
               face.

                                     14-YEAR-OLD BOY (O.S.)
                         "The marrow of his bone," I repeated 
                         aimlessly. This at least penetrated 
                         my mind. Phineas had died from the 
                         marrow of his bone flowing down his 
                         blood stream to his heart.

               INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

               The voice belongs to one of Miles's PUPILS reading aloud in 
               class. Other students follow along silently from their own 
               copies of A Separate Peace.

               SUPERIMPOSED --

                                     FIVE WEEKS LATER

               Miles sits behind his desk at the front of the class.

                                     14-YEAR-OLD BOY
                         I did not cry then or ever about 
                         Finny. I did not cry even when I 
                         stood watching him being lowered 
                         into his family's straight-laced 
                         burial ground outside of Boston. I 
                         could not escape a feeling that this 
                         was my own funeral, and you do not 
                         cry in that case.

               The students look up.

                                     14-YEAR-OLD BOY
                         Do you want me to keep reading the 
                         next chapter, Mr. Raymond?

                                     MILES
                              (as though coming to)
                         Hrnrnrn? No, we'll pick up there on 
                         Monday.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - EVENING

               Miles enters his tiny apartment. He loosens his tie and puts 
               down his satchel.

               On his way to the kitchen, he presses a button on his 
               ANSWERING MACHINE. As it plays, he opens the REFRIGERATOR 
               and looks inside.

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                         One new message.

                                     MAYA'S VOICE
                         Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

               Miles FREEZES, not wanting to miss a single syllable.

                                     MAYA'S VOICE
                         Thanks for your letter. I would have 
                         called you sooner, but I think I've 
                         needed some time to think about 
                         everything that happened and what 
                         you wrote to me. Another reason I 
                         didn't call sooner is that I wanted 
                         to finish your book, which I finally 
                         did last night.

               Miles's heart pounds.

                                     MAYA'S VOICE
                         I think it's really lovely, Miles. 
                         You're so good with words. Who cares 
                         if it's not getting published? There 
                         are so many beautiful and painful 
                         things about it. Did you really go 
                         through all that? It must have been 
                         awfully hard. And the sister character --
                         Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to 
                         say I was really confused by the 
                         ending. Did the father finally commit 
                         suicide, or what? It's driving me 
                         crazy. And the title.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

               We see ourselves taking the BUELLTON EXIT.

                                     MAYA'S VOICE
                         Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy 
                         here lately. But I like winter. So 
                         listen, if you ever do decide to 
                         come up here again, you should let 
                         me know. I would say stop by the 
                         Hitching Post, but to tell you the 
                         truth I'm not sure how much longer 
                         I'm going to be working there. I'm 
                         going to graduate soon so I'll 
                         probably relocate. We'll see.

               EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Miles climbs the wooden steps and approaches Maya's back 
               door.

                                     MAYA'S VOICE
                         Anyway, like I said, I really loved 
                         your novel. Don't give up, Miles. 
                         Keep writing. You're really good. 
                         Hope you're well. Bye.

               Miles takes a breath. Finally he KNOCKS.

               FADE OUT.

                                         THE END

          1 EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1

          From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket
          of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful
          WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen
          was admiring the falling snow when she saw
          a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
          The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The
          Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and
          three drops of blood fell.
          BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD
          lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
          The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          And because the red seemed so alive against
          the white, she thought, if only I had a
          child as white as snow, lips as red as
          blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and
          all with the strength of that rose.
          A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --

          2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2

          We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and
          PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of
          water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms --
          until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother.

          ERIC (V.O.)
          Soon after, a daughter was born to the
          Queen and was named "Snow White."
          With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud
          father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King
          cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.

          ERIC V/O
          And she was adored throughout the kingdom
          as much for her defiant spirit as for her
          beauty.

          3 EXT. WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 3

          A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE,
          aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         
            2

                         3 CONTINUED: 3

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Pick it up, William.
          Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,
          then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He
          tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable.

                         YOUNG WILLIAM
          It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.
          Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels
          down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie,
          calming its flapping before she picks it up.
          High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on.

          4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4

          SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William
          dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are
          lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a
          BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens,
          HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Hurry, William! Hurry!
          They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in
          the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead --

          5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5

           A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It
           stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.

                         6 OMITTED 6

          7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7

          Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen
          turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow
          White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's
          smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken.

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          We found it in the woods.
          The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King
          looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and
          carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the
          doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks.
          The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing.

                         QUEEN
          It will heal in time.
          Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         7 CONTINUED: 7

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'll look after it.
          The King watches Snow White, hiding his sorrow behind a smile.
          So does the Queen, holding back her tears.

                         QUEEN
          You possess a rare beauty, my love. In
          here.
          (She touches Snow white's heart)
          Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need
          its strength to one day become Queen.

          8 EXT. CLOISTER GARDEN/ CASTLE - DAY. 8

          Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his
          back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister
          gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and
          offers it to Snow White.
          He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding.
          Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a
          huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the
          tree and they fall to the ground.
          And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,
          DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony.

                         KING MAGNUS
          My daughter will need your son's friendship
          more than ever, Duke Hammond. As will I
          yours.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          We are here to serve you, your Majesty.
          As the King watches his daughter, ERIC'S VOICEOVER resumes:

          ERIC (V.0)
          The next winter was the harshest in memory
          and Snow White's mother passed away.
          Ba EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 8a
          The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King
          Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken.
          A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers
          and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move
          aside.

          ERIC (V.0)
          A year went by but the King was
          inconsolable. Taking advantage of his
          grief, dark forces gathered on the
          kingdom's borders.

                         9 OMITTED 9

          10 EXT. FOREST/ BATTLEFIELD - DAY 10

           From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a
           clearing. At the head is --
          King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a
          line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at--
          Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are
          silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless
          warriors.
          King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          From what hell comes this army?

                         KING MAGNUS
          A hell they'll soon revisit!
          King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides
          forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to
          him.
          The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of
          the battlefield. When they meet --
          Hand to hand combat at its most brutal.
          King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR

          SHATTERS LIKE GLASS.
          All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors
          shattering, evaporating.
          Strange.
          DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and
          furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now
          that quiet.
          The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
          SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until
          all that is left in the field is --

          ERIC (V.0.)
          The unholy army was defeated, leaving
          King Magnus with the spoils of victory.
          A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there.
          King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When
          he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to
          look inside.

          Inside the cage, a WOMAN COWERS, her face hidden behind a veil.
          King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars, then with a
          mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters.

                         KING MAGNUS
          You are now free. You have nothing to fear
          from me.
          Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the
          King kneels beside the terrified woman.

                         KING MAGNUS
          What is your name, my lady?
          Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's
          his beloved Queen behind the veil. Gently, he lifts her veil.
          It's not his wife, but the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.

                         RAVENNA
          My name is Ravenna, sire.
          The King is speechless now, gazing upon the face of an angel.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          So struck by her beauty was the King, that
          he forgot, for the first time, his broken
          heart.
          His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment.
          When she lifts her head --

          YOUNG RAVENNA - her face reflected in a small hand mirror.
          Ravenna as a child, beautiful but poor, looks into the
          mirror. Her MOTHER, a gypsy woman in tattered clothes, moves
          the mirror closer.

                         RAVENNA'S MOTHER
          This - is all that can save you, Ravenna.
          The young Ravenna looks away, distracted by SHOUTS and
          COMMOTION outside.

          A little boy, FINN, runs as fast as he can through the snow

           Ravenna!

          11 INT. PREPARATION CHAMBER/ CASTLE - DAY. 11


          CU - RAVENNA'S FACE
          Present day. Still as a statue and even more beautiful as
          cheeks are powdered, eyebrows plucked and lips painted by
          several sets of HANDS. Her eyes stare straight ahead,
          unblinking, her mind elsewhere.
          Attendants are preparing Ravenna for her wedding to the King.

          SNOW WHITE (O.S.)
          You're so beautiful...
          Ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of Snow White,
          reverential, standing a few feet away.
          Ravenna's face softens as she looks at the face of Snow
          White. Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out
          her arm - "Come."
          As Snow White steps forward, the handmaidens withdraw until
          only one is left, weaving beautiful flowers in Ravenna's
          hair.

                         RAVENNA
          That is kind, child. Especially when it is
          said that yours is the face of true beauty
          in this kingdom.
          Snow White doesn't quite know how to answer this.

                         RAVENNA
          (A warm smile)
          Would you like to be dressed up like this
          and married one day?
          Snow White nods.

                         RAVENNA
          I hope you'll invite me?

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Of course.
          Snow White smiles, enchanted by her new friend.

                         RAVENNA
          I know it is difficult, child. When I
          was your age I, too, lost my mother.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You did?

          Yes. A King tore me from her arms,
          dressed me in lace and stole my
          innocence.
          Snow White's smile dies a bit; confused.

                         RAVENNA
          I can never take your mother's place, but
          I feel that you and I are bound.
          (touches her heart)
          I feel it here.
          Snow White mimics, touching her own heart, and smiles at
          Ravenna. It should be a touching moment but something in
          Snow White's face - the way her smile lights up the room -
          gives Ravenna pause.

          12 INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY 12

          Ravenna, in a stunning dress,.walks down the center aisle. All
          the NOBLES in the land are present.
          Ravenna looks at them, on either side of the aisle. They are all
          smiling, nodding appreciation. But they aren't really looking
          at Ravenna. She follows their gaze to --
          Snow White, behind, holding the folds of silk from the
          wedding dress. Snow White looks up, adoringly, at Ravenna.
          As the bride and groom reach the altar, KING MAGNUS turns and
          smiles, the happiest man alive.

          13 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT 13

          King Magnus lies on the bed, drunk - half with wine and half
          with lust. His eyes fixed on --
          Ravenna, in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the fireplace,
          holding a goblet. Staring a seductive hole through him.
          She starts slowly toward him, never taking her eyes off him.
          He licks his lips - can't wait for her to arrive.

                         KING MAGNUS
          (Gazing at her lustfully)
          Who are you?

                         RAVENNA
          The bane of Kings.
          When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed, rolls
          him on his back, straddles him and offers the goblet.

                         RAVENNA
          Sup, my lord.
          King Magnus drains the goblet, tosses it and gropes her body.

          Now you are mine.
          Her eyes gleam in the firelight. Magnus tries to playfully
          wrestle her off, but she grabs his hands and holds him down
          firmly.

                         RAVENNA
          I will destroy you.

                         KING MAGNUS

                         (LOVING IT)
          Indeed, you will.
          She rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on the
          lips. He can't believe how good she tastes.

                         RAVENNA
          As my people were destroyed. As my family
          was destroyed. As I would have been
          destroyed.
          He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show
          discomfort.

                         RAVENNA
          But when a woman stays young forever - no
          man can resist her - and the world is hers.
          He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE, his eyes widening in surprise.
          As he struggles for breath...

                         KING MAGNUS
          What...?

                         RAVENNA
          First I will take your life, my lord. Then
          I will take your throne.
          She reaches beneath the sheets, pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER
          and BRINGS IT DOWN THROUGH HIM --
          13a EXT. OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM 13a
          Several Guards line the hallway. The door opens and Ravenna
          emerges. As she moves past them...

                         RAVENNA
          The King has laid down his sword for the
          night.
          Their eyes take her, lustfully, in as she strides away and
          disappears around a corner.

          You must trust me, my love.
          With a small blade she nicks Ravenna's wrist. Three drops of
          blood fall into the white liquid - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
          Finn, Ravenna's brother blasts through the door.

                         FINN
          They're coming! The King's men!

          Ravenna chokes it down.

          Drink! And with it the ability to steal
          youth and beauty! For that is your
          ultimate power and only protection.
          Finn steps forward.

                         FINN
          I will protect my sister!
          Ravenna's mother reaches out and touches her son's forehead,
          closes her eyes, an incantation of sorts...

          Ravenna exits the castle and crosses the courtyard with a
          lantern. A portcullis opens and DARK FIGURES emerge from the
          shadows, entering the castle. Leading them is a tall pale-eyed
          warrior (FINN). He looks at Ravenna devotedly.

                         RAVENNA
          Welcome, brother.

          We see the shadows of the invaders sweeping through the
          corridors, putting the King's sleeping soldiers to the sword.

          Snow White lies asleep when she hears a bell ringing. At first
          she thinks she's dreaming, but then she hears cries of alarm.
          She sits up curiously, then climbs out of bed --

          17 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SNOW WHITE'S ROOM - NIGHT. 17

          There's panic and chaos outside, COURTIERS and SOLDIERS running
          for their lives. Snow White stares in confusion, then runs too -

          18 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT. 18

          Snow White rushes towards her father's chamber and sees Ravenna
          at the end of the corridor. Relieved, she hurries towards her
          stepmother when suddenly she notices her father's lifeless body
          lying on the bed. FINN and his KNIGHTS appear beside Ravenna. It
          takes a moment for the betrayal to sink in, tears of shock
          welling in Snow White's eyes, before she turns and flees --

          19 EXT. COURTYARD/CASTLE -- NIGHT. 19

          The chaos has spread to the courtyard, DUKE HAMMOND'S KNIGHTS
          struggling to hold back the invaders. Snow White hurries out,
          dazed by the sight of battle, then sees William pull free of his
          father's guards and run towards her --
          William grabs her protectively when strong arms reach down and
          lift them both onto the back of separate horses. Duke Hammond
          and his personal guard are attempting to ride out of the castle
          before the portcullis closes.
          The Duke rides under the portcullis with William. His bodyguard
          is about to follow when an ARROW FROM FINN STRIKES HIM IN THE
          BACK and both he and Snow White are thrown off their horse.

                         YOUNG WILLIAM
          Father! The Princess!
          But the portcullis is down, separating Snow White and William.
          The last thing he sees is Snow White struggling in Finn's arms,
          being hauled back into the castle.

          20 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - NIGHT 20

          Ravenna walks from statue to painting to urn, toppling and
          tearing them from the walls. Cleaning house. Ravenna's soldiers
          deliver a large object, then leaving her alone. A BEAUTIFUL
          MIRROR rests against the wall. Ravenna stares at it.

                         RAVENNA
          Mirror, mirror, on the wall
          Who is the fairest of them all?
          There'.s a brief silence, then the surface of the mirror ripples.
          LIQUID-spills onto the floor where it reforms into the shape of
          THE MIRROR MAN. His body is a veil of reflective bronze but his
          face-is a distorted version of Ravenna's own.

          your power and beauty?
          Ravenna smiles, moves to the center of the room, raises her arms
          and drunk with power --
          SCREAMS! The scream becomes --

          arms. Finn throws himself into the mix but is backhanded to
          the ground. Ravenna's mother moves forward, ready to attack.
          The Guard holding Ravenna pulls a dagger and puts it to
          Ravenna's throat, which stops her mother.
          Ravenna is dragged away and tossed on the back of a horse --

          But be warned Ravenna: By fairest blood
          it is done and only by fairest blood can
          it be undone.
          Ravenna looks back to see her mother and other gypsies put to
          the sword.
          Finn struggles free and chases after the King's men as they

          of Snow White, who stares defiantly at Ravenna.

          Finn stops his exit with Snow White, and turns. Ravenna

           ERIC (V.0.)
          The spell Ravenna's mother placed on her
          gave her the ability to steal youth and
          beauty, and indeed all things good, for
          her own evil purposes. But for every
          life there must be a death, for every
          gain, loss, and under the reign of
          Ravenna nature turned on itself and
          people turned on each other.

          And all this time, she kept Snow White in
          a cell in the north tower.
          Ravenna, in the shadows, sits perfectly still. Though it's
          been years she looks the same. The object of her gaze is --
          Snow White, who has changed. She is now a woman, lying in a
          darkened cell. Asleep.
          Around the corner, Finn secretly eyes his sister, who doesn't
          notice him.
          Ravenna, just outside the cell, doesn't blink, entranced by
          Snow White. Strange.
          Snow White opens her eyes and sees Ravenna. This is not the
          first time this has happened. Their eyes locked. Then...

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why?...
          Ravenna doesn't answer, just stands and walks away.

          22 EXT. WOODS - DAY. 22

          A chill wind whips through the woods. Lying sprawled on the
          ground we see a man (ERIC) who looks like he's dead.

                         (CONTINUED)

          It's only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the
          empty FLAGON OF GROG by his side and realize he's drunk. His
          eyes flicker, as a WOMAN'S SCREAM cuts through the woods.

                         FLASH TO:

          THE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN
          SARA, beautiful, in pain. A patch of blood blossoms on her
          dress. Her mouth is open, screaming but no sound comes out.

          BACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM
          Eric's eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it
          again.

          ROSE (O.S.)
          Help!!!!
          He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a
          hangover, then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them into
          his harness on his back --

          23-240MITTED 23-24

          25 EXT. FOREST - DAY. 25

          Eric runs past trees and ducks under branches, crashing into a
          few, still drunk. As he arrives at a clearing he sees a
          beautiful girl, (ROSE), fighting off a HUGE TATTOOED WARRIOR,

          (BROCH).

                         ERIC
          Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head!
          BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised.

                         BROCH
          Ale given you courage again, huntsman?

                         ERIC
          Won't take much courage to split your skull
          from here.

                         BROCH
          Aye, but first you'd have to see straight.
          Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear
          his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and
          MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened
          Greta's head --
          Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe.
          Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows, his natural skill and
          dexterity slowed down by all the ale he's drunk.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the
          trees. He corners him against an oak and swings his axe -- only
          for Eric to duck at the last moment --
          The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now
          from Eric's dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap. He
          draws his second hatchet, but instead of using the blade, cracks
          Broch over the head with the handle, knocking him out.
          Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through Broch's
          pockets.

                         ROSE
          Thank you.
          Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her
          thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin,
          examining her pretty features. Rose doesn't seem to mind,
          looking back with an inviting smile.

                         ROSE
          I don't know how to repay you?
          Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and
          tosses her over his shoulders.

                         ERIC
          Don't worry, somebody else will.

          27 EXT. VILLAGE - DAY. 27

          And now we see a RICKETY PRISON WAGON full of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS,
          just like Rose, staring out furiously from behind bars. Eric and
          a SLAVE MERCHANT haggle over Rose who is bound and gagged,
          looking just as furious as the other women.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Her nose is on the large size and her
          chin's a little weak.

                         ERIC
          Your eyes are dim.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          I'll give you two gold pieces.

                         ERIC
          After all the business we've done
          together?
          Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Four gold pieces and that's my final offer!
          Eric doesn't even bother to turn around.

                         ERIC
          I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank
          you.
          The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out:

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Ten gold pieces!
          Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just
          considering the price. Then he smiles, turns. They have a deal.

          28 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL - DAY. 28

          We get our first good look at grown Snow White as she shaves
          wood for a fire. She's done this every day for years. A
          regimen. Her hands work precisely as she stacks the wood and
          blows on the kindling.

          The fire is now burning and Snow White warms her hands on it.
          She hears APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. Unusual. She jumps up gets
          in her bed and pretends to sleep.
          A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds
          later the door CLANGS SHUT.
          As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her
          cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Hello?... What's your name?
          Rose, sitting in a dark corner, goes to her cell bars and
          looks out.

                         ROSE
          I am Rose.
          Snow White smiles - a friendly face.

          31 INT. QUEEN'S BATHING ROOM - DAY. 31

          Ravenna stands, attended by MAIDS, in a black gown, open in
          front. Appropriate in private but not when --
          Ravenna's GENERALS and Finn stand across from her. The
          Generals avert their eyes, made uncomfortable by her near
          nakedness.
          The General uses a pointer to make his presentation while
          another holds a map.

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          There are scattered rebel groups on the
          fringe of the dark forest, but they cause
          little harm.

          She dips her fingers into a bowl of DEAD SONGBIRDS, plucks
          out a tiny heart and eats it as she listens, not happy.

                         RAVENNA
          And what of the Duke?

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          We have pushed his forces into the
          mountains but his stronghold at Carmath 
          holds firm.

                         RAVENNA
          Lay siege to it.

                         ANOTHER GENERAL
          The mountains and fortress provide
          impenetrable protection, my Queen.

                         RAVENNA
          Then lure him out! Burn every village
          that supports him. Poison their wells.
          If they still resist put their heads on
          pikes to decorate the roads!

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          My Queen.
          (chooses words carefully)
          They have taken the fight to us. Rebels
          harry our supply lines and rob our pay
          wagons. 

                         ANOTHER GENERAL
          We have just captured two of the rebel
          leaders. They will be put to the sword.

                         RAVENNA
          I wish to interrogate them myself.
          She drops her robe and walks up the steps to her bath. She
          lowers herself into the white liquid. Her face disappears
          beneath the viscous liquid, then she rises, like a porcelain
          statue.

           heart. Ravenna's claw plucks the tiny heart and we follow it
           to her mouth.
           She is dressed now and stands at a window, Finn at her side. 
           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW - A CROWD OF STARVING PEASANTS at the foot 
           of the castle, fight over the milk pouring from her bath.

          All the girls in our village were taken.
          I was trying to reach safe haven at Duke
          Hammond's castle when I was caught --
          Snow White bursts with hope --

          The Duke?! He's alive?! He still fights
          in my father's name?!
          Rose stares at the feral girl now, realizing who she is.

                         ROSE
          You're the king's daughter? Princess?...
          The night the evil one's reign began we
          were told all in the castle were put to

          Ravenna sweeps into the great hall.
          The Generals and Finn snap to attention. She stops and stares
          at TWO MEN, the captured insurgents.
          THOMAS, a grizzled old rebel, looks badly bruised and beaten,
          while his handsome son, LAIN, is unmarked. They both stare at
          her defiantly.
          Ravenna faces the two rebels. A SOLDIER steps forward.

                         SOLDIER
          My Queen, these two were captured leading
          an ambush of our supply caravan.
          Ravenna seems intrigued, steps forward, eyeing them.

                         RAVENNA
          You left your home, your family, the bosom
          of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why?

                         THOMAS
          Because under your rule we have lost
          everything. We will not stop until this
          kingdom is free.

                         RAVENNA
          Lost everything?

                         (REGARDS IAIN)
          Your son?
          She moves to Iain, right up to his face.

                         RAVENNA
          Very handsome.

                         (TO THOMAS)
          Obviously a debt owed to your wife.
          She reaches out and touches Iain's strong jaw. He struggles
          against the Guards that hold him back.

                         RAVENNA
          There was a time I would have lost my heart
          to a face like yours -- and you would have
          no doubt broken mine.
          In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into
          Ravenna's chest. She makes a pained face, looks down at the
          dagger, then up to Iain.

                         RAVENNA
          You would kill your Queen?
          She pulls the dagger out - there is no"wound, no blood - and
          drops it on the ground. Iain and Thomas are shocked.

          strong is your heart?
          She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his
          chest. We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND LOUDER.
          He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his
          ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead.
          Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son.
          Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her hand.

                         RAVENNA
          No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of
          the generosity of his Queen.
          With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that
          we see the lines on her face. Finn takes her by the arm as she
          falters.

          My powers... fade.
          This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches
          as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he
          turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn
          nods.

          33a INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE 33a
          Ravenna walks into the room. Eyes the mirror, afraid to look
          at herself.

          FINN (O.S.)
          I have something for what ails you.
          She turns to see --
          Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles.
          Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires
          her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and --
          LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but
          instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth,
          DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming,
          her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until
          she's as old as the scullery maids.

          34 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL 34

          Snow White hears approaching footsteps and watches as a Guard
          opens Greta's cell and tosses someone in.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Rose?...
          The Guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away.
          Snow White peers through the shadows. Can't quite make her
          out.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Rose?...

          35 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 35

          RAVENNA stares into her mirror now, rejuvenated.

                         RAVENNA
          Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
          Who is the fairest of them all?
          The bronze ripples. The Mirror Man pours out and reforms.

                         MIRROR MAN
          My Queen, you have defied nature and
          robbed it of its fairest fruit. But on
          this day there is one more beautiful than
          you.

                         RAVENNA

          Ravenna is shocked by this, staggers a bit.

                         RAVENNA
          Snow White?

          (back to mirror)
          I should have killed her as a child. She
          is my undoing?

                         MIRROR MAN
          She is also your treasure, Queen. It was
          wise to have kept her close for the
          innocence and purity that can destroy can
          also heal. Hold her heart in your hands
          and you shall never again need to consume
          youth. You shall never again weaken or
          age. Immortality without cost!
          Ravenna laughs, overjoyed.
          Finn appears out of the shadows. All he sees is his sister
          laughing, giddily into her mirror, no sign of the mirror man,
          as if it exists only in her head.

                         FINN
          Yes, Queen?...

          38 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL - DAY. 38

          Snow White paces in her cell, frantic.
          Two magpies appear in the window. She looks at them and
          watches as they flap their wings. Like they're trying to
          tell her something. She moves toward them.
          They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside
          the cell window, hovering there.
          She is confused but notices --
          A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover.
          Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the
          loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by
          bit, breaks free.
          She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when --
          The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid --

                         38 CONTINUED: 38
          Snow White hears FOOTSTEPS down the hall.
          She steadies herself, yanks once, twice and the nail comes
          loose.
          she jumps down, lies in her bed again just as --
          Finn unlocks her door, leaving the key in the lock, and walks
          into the cell. He stands there until she turns her head
          slightly to him.
          She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she
          tries to lure him closer with her eyes.

                         FINN
          Did I wake you?
          Snow White shakes her head gently.

                         FINN
          Are you always awake when I watch you?

                         SNOW WHITE

                         (HOARSELY)
          Yes.
          She looks away.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You've never come in before.

                         FINN
          My Queen won't allow it. She wants you
          all to herself.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'm afraid of her.

          Not of me.

                         SNOW WHITE
          No.
          He can't help himself, reaches out and touches her arm.

                         FINN
          It's alright, princess. You will never
          again be locked in a cell.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What does she want from me?
          His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it
          gently, and then to her chest. With his free hand he reaches
          back for his dagger.

          Your beating heart.
          Snow White grips the roofing nail even tighter as she looks
          at him. As he leans closer, she notices his off hand - the
          dagger and --
          She SLASHES him across the face with the nail. Blood flies.
          Finn reacts, grabs his face in pain, yells and Snow White
          kicks him and runs for the door, locking it behind --

          39 INT. GRETA'S CELL/ TOWER STEPS - DAY. 39

          Snow White hurtles down the steps to Greta's cell. She is
          shocked by what she sees. Rose, now an old woman, looks to her.
          Snow White fumbles with the keys. Rose holds out both her
          hands. Snow White takes them, looks into her eyes.

                         ROSE
          Go.
          Finn stumbles to the cell door, clutching his face.

                         FINN

          GUARDS!
          Snow White tosses the keys into an empty cell and races away.

          40 INT. CORRIDOR/ CASTLE - DAY. 40

          Snow White runs down the steps into a corridor and sees ARMED
          GUARDS appear at the other end. She hurries into another tower,
          bolting the door shut behind her, and charges down the steps.

          41 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAY. 41

          SNOW WHITE BURSTS OUTSIDE -- into the light. She almost
          hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through
          the courtyard toward the portcullis.
          The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to
          follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at
          the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS.
          As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the
          darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through
          the opening, running towards the Portcullis instead.

          42 INT. SEWER - DAY. 42

           Snow White splashes through the deep stinking sludge.

          43 EXT. PORTCULLIS - DAY. 43

           The old rebel, Thomas, with his son's body draped over a mule,
          looks back curiously as he hears the guards yelling --

          CHIEF GUARD 0/S
          Open the gates! The Princess has escaped!
          He stares in surprise as riders gallop out.

          44 EXT. SEA - OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 44

          Snow White is swept out of the sewers into the sea. Seaweed
          wraps itself around her limbs, pulling her deeper.into the
          depths, but she kicks and fights her way back to the surface --
          gasping for air.

          45 EXT. BEACH -- OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 45

          Snow White swims ashore. She looks up and sees a maze of large
          rocks stretching out. She sets off in one direction when the two
          MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another
          direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE
          waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to
          climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash.

          46 EXT. BEACH - DAY. 46

          Galloping hooves skim the surf, RIDERS pursuing Snow White.

          47 EXT. DECIMATED VILLAGE - DAY. 47

          Snow White rides towards the village -- only it's unrecognizable
          now -- most of the cottages have been razed to the ground or
          boarded up.
          A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry,
          desperate - see her approach and move out to greet her.
          She stops her horse for a moment, gazing past tears at the
          devastation and the state of villagers all around her.
          At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer
          their faces reveal dangerous desperation and --
          She gallops off, looking back to see the Queen's men giving
          chase.

          48 EXT. FIELDS AND WOODLAND BEYOND THE VILLAGE - DAY. 48

          The fields and woods are even more devastated than the village.
          Farmland has been burnt to cinders and trees chopped down. All
          around Snow White the world is stubble and ash.

          49 EXT. ENDLESS MOOR - AERIAL SHOT - DAY. 49

          Snow White crests a hill, her mare rearing as she sees -- THE
          DARK FOREST -- A VAST WALL OF PRIMORDIAL TREES. A mist seeps
          from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates --
          then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on --

          50 EXT. MISTY BOGS/ ENTRANCE TO THE DARK FOREST - DAY. 50

          Shadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then
          suddenly loses her footing. She rears -- throwing Snow White
          onto the safety of solid ground.
          Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not
          wanting to endanger her life. She tries again but the horse
          backs farther away from her. Slowly they're separated by the
          swirling fog --
          As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear.
          Reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest --

          The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick
          in terror. One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog,
          frightening off the others.
          Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too
          afraid to enter the forest.

          51 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 51

          Snow White hurtles through the trees, a ghostly fog rising up
          all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in --
          A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She
          coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She
          hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now --
          The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her
          through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing
          out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her
          like a hand and now she runs --
          More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles
          again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the
          trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on
          her until she finally passes out.

          52 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF DARK FOREST -- DAY.(D4N) 52

          From high above, we see the unconscious Snow White as mist
          whirls in a circle.

          From above we see Ravenna striding furiously in a circle of
          her own. She is livid, a whirling dervish.
          She's fairly spitting as she barks at Finn, who stands in the
          middle of the room, his face bleeding.

                         RAVENNA
          How is it an innocent young girl makes a
          fool of my brother?! Armed only with a
          nail?! If she'd had a sword she'd have
          taken the whole castle!
          We're in front of her, behind her, on her face, on her feet --
          She picks up the pace as well as the volume --

                         RAVENNA
          You swore to protect me! Do you not

          looks at her.

          She was chased into the dark forest.

          The Queen demands the services of someone
          to navigate the Dark Forest.

          There's one man. A widower.

          In the Inn. Drinking.
          THE SOUND OF SMASHING WOOD. They turn to see --
          Eric flies through the Inn's wall and lands in a heap on the
          ground.

                         OLD-TIMER
          Appears he's finished.

          Eric. Drunk. He tries to focus as Broch strides through the
          same hole and stands over him.

          You owe me money from my pocket and money
          for the girl!

                         ERIC
          I have it right here in my pocket. If
          you'll just help me up.
          Eric holds his hand out. Broch walks over, suspicious. When
          he's close, Eric grabs his arm and kicks with both feet in
          Broch's chest. Broch flies back, then strides to Eric and
          kicks him in the side. Hurts.

                         BROCH
          I want my money!

                         ERIC
          Actually, I seem to have drunk it all.
          You're welcome to it when it comes out
          again.
          Broch hauls him back up to his feet. He takes a swing but
          somehow the drunken Eric dodges the blow, swinging back at
          him.
          Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight.
          Eric lands a body blow to Broch, who doubles over. Eric
          comes in for the kill, winds up and swings -
          Missing Broch but hitting a HORSE on the ass. It kicks its
          legs, sending him flying. He lands in a heap and drops his
          head back.
          Hands lift him and --
          Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few
          seconds before he comes to and lifts out his head, eyes still
          closed.

          RAVENS perch on the ledges and LURCHERS scamper about.
          Eric, still drunk, filthy, damp clothes, face bruised, enters
          the room, eyes the ravens, then looks at --
          Ravenna on her throne. She watches him curiously. He's more
          interested in the aged scullery maids, including Rose, who are
          staring at him accusingly. He has no idea who they are or what
          he's done wrong. Finally he comes before the Queen, sizing her
          up like a tavern beauty.

          Then she is certainly dead.

                         RAVENNA

          Eric holds her gaze, uneasy at the request.

          I've been to the Dark Forest enough times

          cut him to pieces. Eric eyes them, then looks to her and, in
          complete honesty --

          Eric reacts instinctively, grabbing her by the throat. The
          courtiers rise to their feet and the guards draw their
          swords, but Ravenna holds up her hand.

                         ERIC
          My wife is none of your concern.
          Something about her face, the fact that she enjoys his hand
          on her throat makes Eric queasy. He releases his grip,
          stares right at Ravenna.

                         RAVENNA

          Nothing will bring her back.

          Even the horses sense danger and start to whinny and back up.

          Vines and roots have grown over Snow White's body, as if the
          forest is trying to devour her. She opens her eyes, sees her
          wrists and ankles bound and reacts in horror, struggling to free
          herself of her bonds.

          stones that disappear into the bog as soon as his full weight is
          on them. The others catch on and follow, stepping on stones of
          their own.
          Once they're across the bog and onto dry land Finn takes a
          step forward but Eric grabs his arm.

          Exactly as I do.
          Eric puts a cloth to his face, gesturing for Finn and his guards
          to do the same and moves forward through the mushroom field -
          pops of pollen misting all around them.
          Eric stops, bends down, spotting faint FOOTPRINTS in the dew. He
          walks faster now, Finn watching in admiration.

           she's being followed. She looks up at the trees but all she sees
           are vague shadows. The wind picks up, ghostly voices howling in
          the breeze. She's rooted to the spot for a moment, then loses
          her nerve and runs --

          One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he
          sees a GHOSTLY REFLECTION gazing back at him. He stares in
          surprise, leaning closer. Suddenly a BARBED TAIL shoots out
          of the water -- skewering him -- and drags him into the
          depths.
          The others turn as they hear a scream but there's no sign of
          their companion now, just the bubbling water.
          Only Finn looks unconcerned.
          Eric stops senses something, holds up a hand.
          Then darts ahead, leaving them flat-footed. Finn makes a
          decision to follow and waves for his Guards to go ahead of
          him.
          They reluctantly follow Eric.

          65 EXT. DARK FOREST - MOMENTS LATER - DAY. 65

          Eric moves quickly then stops, listens - we see his hunting
          skills - as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the
          distance, he blasts away, moving like lightning.

          66 EXT. TREES/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 66

          Snow White feels like the whole forest is pursuing her. Running
          out of breath, she hides in some bushes. As she stares into the
          mist, she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze.
          Eric stops and looks around, sensing his prey is close. Snow
          White stays low, trying to quieten her breathing.
          Eric studies the forest floor. He sees Snow White's footprints,
          then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth.
          Snow White peers through the bushes and sees the huntsman's
          boots approaching. She looks around for something to defend
          herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades. She can't
          see anyone now. She looks relieved when SUDDENLY STRONG HANDS

          GRAB HER BY THE FEET AND DRAG HER OUT OF THE BUSHES.
          She fights to get away but he pins her with a foot, reaches
          down and turns her over.
          His first look at her gives him pause. Her face, her spirit,
          her youth. She slaps at him - he pulls out his knife with
          one hand while he pins her with the other.
          Then grabs, lifts her.

                         SNOW WHITE

          He somehow believes her. New game. Then...

          Quick work!
          Eric looks up to see Finn and his men approaching. Snow White
          gasps at the sight of Finn.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Him! He's the one! He came at me with a
          knife!
          Eric holds her tight, one arm around her neck.

                         FINN
          Well done, huntsman. Hand her over.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You can't trust him!

                         ERIC
          What do you intend to do with her?

                         FINN
          Why do you care?
          Finn nods and the Guards approach. Eric grips her tighter.

                         ERIC

                         (TO FINN)
          You want her. Give me what I was
          promised.

                         FINN
          Come now huntsman, you did your job well.
          Keep your word and hand her over.

          Shut up! -

          He'll kill us both -

                         ERIC
          I said, shut up!
          He puts his knife to her throat to quiet her.

                         ERIC

                         (TO FINN)
          I'll keep my word when the Queen keeps
          hers.
          Finn shakes his head and laughs.

                         FINN
          You are a drunk and a fool. My Queen has
          many powers; she can take life or sustain
          it. But she can't bring your wife back
          from the dead.

                         ERIC

          I WANT HER BACK!
          His face tells us how much Eric wanted, needed to believe.
          The Guards keep inching toward Eric.
          Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts
          slowly backing up.
          Finn pulls his own sword and approaches.
          Four against one. As they burst toward him he tosses Snow
          White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife
          into the chest of one of the Guards, who crumbles.
          Eric reaches behind, grabs both hatchets and faces off with
          the others.
          They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he
          raises a hatchet, throws it --
          Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no
          wound. Finn pulls it out, laughs and throws it at the
          huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree.
          Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They
          notice her exit but keep fighting.
          Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn
          manages to plunge a sword in his side.

          Eric grunts and falls back. Finn races forward to finish him
          off but Eric lunges and --
          Flips Finn onto his back and into a grove of mushrooms.
          Eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other
          Guards, who look from Finn, who is dazed, to Eric, who is
          hurt.
          Finn struggles to his knees, shakes his head, hallucinating a
          bit.

                         FINN
          Butcher him! Find her!
          The Guards, also trying to cover their noses, move forward.
          Eric has a decision to make.
          Bad odds. And he's injured. Eric decides in an instant,
          grabs his knife out of the dead Guard, as well as his hatchet
          from the tree and runs after Snow White --

          67 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 67

          Snow White crashes through the woods.
          Then a HAND grabs her shoulder--
          Eric. He slaps a palm over her mouth before she can scream
          and slides down a steep slope into undergrowth.
          67a EXT. DARK FOREST - FINN - SAME 67a
          Finn is on his feet but still hallucinating - stumbling
          about. The Guards are spooked as they look all around.

                         FINN
          This is not finished!
          The words echo through the dark forest.

          Eric removes his hand from Snow White's mouth.
          At once she PUNCHES HIM WITH ALL SHE'S GOT.
          He steps back, licks his bloody lip. She takes another swing.
          This one he manages to grab.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Get your hands off me.
          She draws his dagger. He backs off. Eyeball to eyeball:

          I need to get to the Duke's Castle.
          There's an army there. I'll be safe.

          Eric "reluctantly" prices up the job.

          Well,it's a long way, through the

          Tree roots gleam with an eerie phosphorescent light. The mist
          closes in. Snow White looks around the forest, unnerved by
          the haunting silence and the deep shadows. Reluctantly she
          focuses on Eric, trying to take her mind off the terrors
          around her.

          the Queen's supply wagons and the fight is on. A VIOLENT

          CLASH OF SWORDS IN CLOSE QUARTER FIGHTING.
          His COMPANIONS are as wild and hot-headed as he is, roaring
          with delight as the Queen's men finally flee.

          I have news of the Princess.
          William stares in surprise --

                         WILLIAM
          The Princess?!!

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          Ravenna has kept her all these years.

                         WILLIAM
          She lives?!

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          She escaped the castle and into the dark

                         FOREST -
          He turns to leave --

                         WILLIAM
          I'm going after her!.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          We don't know if she survived --
          Duke Hammond grabs him by the arm.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          You ventured beyond the walls tonight,
          disobeying my orders. We are all that's
          left, William. I cannot afford to lose
          any more of my men.

                         WILLIAM
          Then I will go alone.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          And I cannot afford to lose my only heir!
          You do not know the dark forest!

                         WILLIAM
          Then I'll find someone who does.
          William pulls away.

                         WILLIAM
          I will not abandon her a second time.

          A motley crew of woodsmen stand side to side. Finn is eyeing
          them, sizing them up, picking a crew.

                         FINN
          Which of you knows the dark forest?
          A powerfully built Yakut tracker, ALDAN, and BROCH both nod.

                         FINN
          You. You. You. You.
          He's selected Aldan, Broch and points to others. As we move
          down the line we see --
          William, hat low, trying to look tough.
          Finn selects a few more.

                         FINN
          Load and prepare. You ride for bounty.
          Into the dark forest. The rest of you.
          Away !
          As they disperse..
          William sets his jaw, and heads off..

                         CUT TO:
          The men ride out of the village. Suddenly they stop.
          Standing up ahead is William, blocking their path. He calls
          to them.

                         WILLIAM
          You need a bowman?
          FINN calls back.

                         FINN
          I have a bowman. Away.
          WILLIAM stands unblinking.

                         FINN
          I said away, damn you!
          WILLIAM doesn't move. Finn turns to the bowman.

                         FINN
          Kill him.

          The bowman smiles, draws his bow.
          BEFORE he can loose an arrow:

          THWACK! THWACK!!
          Two arrows strike the bowman in the throat, lifting him off
          his horse, stone dead.
          FINN turns. WILLIAM lowers his bow.

                         WILLIAM
          I said do you need a bowman?
          Finn studies William with dead eyes.

          In the pouring rain, a group of fierce BOUNTY HUNTERS ride on
          horseback, when another rider appears, blocking their way.
          It's William.

                         BROCH
          Clear the road.
          But William doesn't budge.
          One of the other mercenaries grins, then rides towards
          William, drawing his sword. He raises it when William
          unslings his bow and loosens two arrows at close range,
          hitting him in each thigh and knocking him off his horse.
          Broch draws his enormous battle axe, about to charge, when
          Finn rides forward and stops him.

                         FINN
          Wait!
          Finn sizes up William.

                         FINN
          You're quick with a bow.

                         WILLIAM
          I want to ride with you.

                         FINN
          Why?

                         WILLIAM
          You are paying well and I need the coin.

                         FINN
          Have you traversed the Dark Forest?

                         WILLIAM
          No.

          Then what use are you?

                         WILLIAM
          As you said, I'm quick with a bow.
          He nods to the guy on the ground, groaning with arrows in his
          thighs.

                         WILLIAM
          And unlike him, I have two good legs.
          Finn considers for a moment, then smiles, nods to the guy on
          the ground.

                         FINN
          Replace him.
          William looks at Finn gratefully. Finn studies him with a
          curious smile then rides on.

          Snow White approaches a stream, kneels, splashes her face and
          brings a handful of water to her lips.

                         ERIC
          I wouldn't do that if I were you.
          Not unless you want your bowels to rip
          apart.
          She turns. Eric has been snoozing on a rock, with one eye
          open. She releases the water, stands and faces off with Eric,
          who offers his flask of mead. She reluctantly takes a sip,
          spits most of it out, hands it back.
          He smells something, walks a few steps, bends down and examines
          a long brown pellet shaped object on the ground.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is it?

                         ERIC

          You want me to call it by another name?
          He doesn't need to. It's an animal dropping. Snow White winces
          as he kneads it between his fingers and takes a long sniff.

          She catches the look of fear in his eyes as he gazes around the
          woods.

                         ERIC
          Stay here.
          He moves away, though the trees, tracking prey. He hears the
          wind call his name...

                         SARA
          Eric.
          He stops, looks to --
          An outcropping of rocks, surrounded by dense forest. From
          out behind a tree steps an apparition of SARA. She's
          beautiful.

                         ERIC
          Sara?...

          BACK TO SNOW WHITE
          She hears him call out and follows his tracks.

          BACK TO HUNTSMAN
          Sara holds out her hand.

                         ERIC
          Am I dreaming?

                         SARA
          Touch me and see for yourself.
          Eric shakes his head, looks around, tries to fight it, but...
          Her face draws him back and he begins to walk toward the
          rocks.

                         SARA
          You weren't there to save me, Eric. I
          called for you but you never came.
          Snow White appears behind and sees --
          Eric is walking toward a dark area where several sets of
          lupine eyes await.
          But Eric only sees Sara and he continues to move toward her.
          She opens her arms to him and steps backwards, luring him.

                         SARA
          Where were you, Eric? Come to me now.
          Protect me now.

           He takes another step toward her and --
          Buckles - THWACK!
          Snow White hits him behind his knees with a piece of wood.
          He hits the ground and she drags him away. He fights back and
          she jumps on top of him, staring right into his face.

                         SNOW WHITE
          She's not real! Not real! Do you hear
          me?!
          He does and calms. She gets off him and he sits up, fatigued
          by the experience. A low point for him.
          He reaches for his flask -- pours the last single drop into
          his mouth. All gone. He tosses it aside. A lost soul.
          Snow White watches him with some compassion. He catches her
          look, gets up and walks away.

          Now stay back. You're too small to

          With it you block and deflect an opposing
          thrust. You'll lose meat but you won't

          Don't pull it out 'til you see my soul.

          84C EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 84C

          A single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna,
          looking weaker than before, stares at it quietly, as if she
          were gazing at Snow White. She reaches out and crushes the
          blossom in her hand, turning it into ash.
          Her look is one of conviction.

                         RAVENNA
          Find her.

          Finn reacts as if he heard Ravenna's words. He did. They have
          that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other
          trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the
          group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in
          the forest.
          William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling
          CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees
          without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the
          others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on.
          87a EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 87a
          Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens
          -- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds
          circling on the distant horizon.
          Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope.
          They hurry through a sea of mist when suddenly Eric stops.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is it?

                         ERIC
          It can't be this easy.
          He quietly unsheathes a hatchet.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Is this the end of the Dark Forest?

                         ERIC

                         SNOW WHITE
          How far to the Duke's castle?
          He ignores, follows tracks, then stops as he sees the STONE
          BRIDGE below -- LEADING OUT OF THE DARK FOREST. Snow White
          stares at it too, relieved. Beyond the bridge there are open
          fens.
          They hurry down together and start to cross the bridge.
          They're half way across WHEN SUDDENLY WE SEE THE STONES START

          TO MOVE BEHIND THEM --

          A PAIR OF EYES OPENS IN THE STONE, AND SLOWLY THE BRIDGE

          STARTS TO RISE --
          Snow White turns to see -- A HUGE CREATURE REARING UP --

          TWENTY FEET TALL. IT'S NOT A BRIDGE AT ALL BUT A --

                         ERIC
          Troll!
          Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in
          the shallow creek below -- among the CARCASSES OF SLAIN
          ANIMALS. The troll roars and comes after them, swinging its
          giant stone fists. Eric grabs Snow White and runs --
          As the troll catches up with them, Eric shoves her out of the
          way and draws his hatchets.

                         ERIC
          Run!
          Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks
          as a mighty arm sweeps over him, darts between the troll's
          legs, and hacks at its leg with his hatchets.
          The Troll falters a bit then --
          A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the
          creek.
          Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the
          ground, his wound bleeding again, at the troll's mercy. She
          hesitates, still terrified, then runs back.
          The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands
          to crush him when --
          Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE!
          The Troll looks around in surprise. So does Eric. A beat,
          then the monster turns away from Eric, striding towards Snow

                         WHITE --
          She stands her ground, fighting her terror, PULLS HER KNIFE.
          The TROLL looms over her, but she doesn't retreat. She raises
          an arm, just as Eric instructed.

          Snow White stares into the troll's eyes, seeing something
          almost gentle in its monstrous gaze, slowly losing her fear.
          The troll stares at her too, confused, then slowly pacified,
          until it finally turns and strides away.
          Eric stares in disbelief. Snow White is rooted to the spot,
          also confused but strangely moved by what's happened. Eric
          rises to his feet painfully and heads over, taking her by the
          arm.

                         ERIC
          I told you to run.

                         SNOW WHITE
          If I had you'd be dead. A "thank you"
          would suffice.
          It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back
          at him. Eric holds her gaze, struggling a bit, then...

                         ERIC
          Thank you.

          88 EXT. MARSHES - DAY. 88

          The sun glints through the thinning trees. Eric wades through
          the deep sludge, Snow White following in his steps.
          Eric looks at her a moment, then suddenly turns away as he
          sees her expression change --
          GHOSTLY BACKLIT FIGURES EMERGE on the banks of the marsh now,
          holding bows and arrows. Eric looks around for an escape route,
          but everywhere he turns MORE FIGURES APPEAR.
          He draws his axe when A FIGURE IN A HOODED CLOAK (ANNA) appears,
          clutching her bow like a goddess.

                         ANNA
          They say only demons or spirits can
          survive the dark forest. Which are you?
          Eric, unsure, pulls his hatchet and steps in front of Snow
          White protecting her.

                         ERIC
          Which are you?

                         ANNA

          spies?

                         ERIC
          We're fugitives from the Queen.

          face. And then a smile.

          The fenland village is made up of mud huts, elevated on stilts

          Snow White speak quietly.

          ON THE BANK
          The boat stops and they get out. The women of the village
          move from their hut to greet them as they walk into the
          village.
          More women emerge from their huts to view the newcomers, no
          men in sight. They all have scarred faces.
          All the women have assembled alongside the group, watching
          with awe as they pass. They stare at Snow White and murmur.
          They can't take their eyes off her. Some even reach out to
          touch her sleeve or dress.

                         SNOW WHITE
          (sotto; to Eric)
          Why are they looking at me like that?

          I don't know, but keep smiling.
          A beautiful LITTLE GIRL, LILY, moves away from her friends
          and offers her hand. Snow White stops, looks down at the
          girl, trying not to stare at her scar.

          You'd be right.
          She looks at him. Shakes her head.

          That's not why. It's because I've never

          truth?

                         ERIC
          Aye I know the truth. And that's exactly
          why she should be as far from me as
          possible.

                         ANNA
          She's the only one that can save us. She
          needs you.

                         ERIC
          Trust me. I'm the last thing she needs.
          I'm bad luck. Everything I've ever cared
          about was destroyed.

                         ANNA
          There's good in you Huntsman. I can see
          it.

          Snow White awakens. Looks around, no Eric, puts it in her
          pocket. Then smells smoke, walks outside and looks up to see --
          The sky BLAZES WITH BURNING ARROWS all raining down on the
          village.

           Eric, moving away from the village, spins to see the ARROWS

          Snow White re-enters the hut just as A FLAMING ARROW pierces
          through the thatch and sticks next to Lily's sleeping head.
          Snow White pushes Lily away from the fire and grabs the
          arrow. Anna SCREAMS because -
          A MERCENARY races into the hut.
          On impulse Snow White backhand STABS HIM in the leg WITH THE
          FLAMING ARROW and he tumbles, flames burning his clothes.
          Snow White stares at him for a moment, his face, his pain.
          Anna shakes her out of the moment and they all race out.

           Snow White runs with Lily and Anna when she sees a FEARSOME
           MERCENARY leap off his horse and stride towards them.

                          SNOW WHITE

                          (TO ANNA)
           Run!
          Snow White faces off with the Mercenary. She does as she's been
          taught - waits for him to approach. When he's close enough to
          grab her slashes at him with the knife. The huge mercenary
          knocks her to the ground and advances on her.
          -- when an arrow strikes him in the shoulder. He falls,
          revealing a young warrior holding a bow.
          It's WILLIAM. Snow White stares at him through the flames, with
          a mixture of recognition and uncertainty.
          It's as if for a moment everything stops as she comes

          FACE TO FACE
          With something from the past. Almost like a ghost. Or a
          vision.. He nods to her in recognition.
          She stands perfectly still.

                         SUDDENLY
          Anna pulls Snow White away, as they move through the smoke
          and the fire.
          William starts to follow, a curtain of smoke swirling around
          him.

          Eric arrives to see the village in flames. He rushes to the
          centre of the village, pulling a mercenary off his horse and
          running him through with his own sword, then fighting and
          killing TWO MORE MERCS as he makes his way forward.

          rides toward him.

          Eric pulls Snow White onwards, the blazing fires from the
          village lighting up the marsh. He sees a lake up ahead when a
          figure appears, blocking their way. It's the giant BROCH.
          Grinning, he unstraps his huge axe, ready to face Eric one more
          time. Eric doesn't even slow down, letting go of Snow White and
          unstrapping his own hatchets. It looks as if it's going to be an
          epic fight, but as Broch swings, Eric ducks and drives both
          hatchets into the giant's ribs, killing him instantly.
          They escape into the darkness.

          Ravenna walks up the spiral staircase. She passes an old
          woman who glances at her. She walks past a few steps, thinks
          she hears a whisper, then turns on a heel.

                         RAVENNA
          What did you say?
          Then she's right in her face --

                         RAVENNA

          WHAT DID YOU SAY!
          The "old woman" just stares at her, shakes her head. There's
          something in the woman's eyes that terrifies Ravenna. She
          backs up, retreating, then scurries away.

           Ravenna sits alone, naked. Her spine stretches through her 
          taut skin. 
          In front of her sits the CROWN on a dark cushion, a matted
          tuft of HAIR caught on the gilded edge. She stares at it,
          then slowly raises her hand to a bald patch at the side of
          her hair.

          distraught over the violence at the village. Eric looks at her

          I will take you to Duke Hammond's.
          Snow White slowly nods.
          Eric lies back and looks up at the sun flickering through the
          trees. It dances on his face and then --
          A HUGE SHADOW blots out the light.
          Before he can react, fists and boots lay into him. As he
          protects his face, we catch glimpses of brutal figures in
          battle masks. Eric kicks a couple of them away, but more of
          them swarm over him, pinning him down in leg locks and choke
          holds.
          Snow White is treated just as roughly, powerful arms and legs
          pinning her down. She bites one of her captors and he twists
          her arms behind her back. A noose is slung around Eric's
          ankles and he's hauled up - hanging upside down. Snow White,
          also tied up, sits on the ground beside him.
          A line of DWARVES stand before them and pull up their
          grotesque BATTLE MASKS.
          The dwarf leader, Beith glowers.

          huntsman.

          Come on, Beith! Is this how you treat a
          friend?
          The dwarf leader, BEITH, glowers.

          Yeah. Or skewer him and leave her to rot!

          That would work, too, but my way's
          cleaner.
          Note: Coll and Duir have this "at each other but we're
          comrades" relationship. Coll also has an incessant cough.

                         MUIR
          No!
          (a beat for emphasis)
          She is destined.
          They all trade looks. Muir is the spiritual leader of the
          group and they dare not speak against him, even Beith.

          She is.

                         BEITH
          Are you?

                         SNOW WHITE
          Do you hate the Queen?

                         BEITH
          Hate's a strong word.

                         (BEAT)
          But not strong enough in this case.

                         SNOW WHITE
          My father was King Magnus.
          This carries weight with the group. Impressed.

                         MUIR
          No one listens to me.

                         SNOW WHITE
          If you accompany us to the Duke's castle
          you will be paid handsomely.

                         ERIC
          We don't need their help.

                         BEITH
          You were already lost seeing that you
          found us.

                         GORT
          How handsomely?

                         SNOW WHITE
          Your weight in gold. Each of you.
          The dwarves trade glances, literally sizing each other up.

                         ERIC
          That's more than you offered me?!

                         BEITH
          Goodness of your heart, eh, Huntsman?

                         DUIR
          (whispers to Coll)
          I get more than you.

                         COLL
          True, but because of your size you eat
          and drink more, which costs more, so...

          Alright, we'll take you, but the huntsman
          can hang -

                         SNOW WHITE
          Both of us.
          Eric looks surprised by her loyalty. So do the dwarves.
          Suddenly Duir calls out:

                         DUIR
          Riders!
          The dwarves look round to see a DOZEN SILHOUETTED HORSEMEN
          appear on the crest of a DISTANT HILL.

                         ERIC
          Those are the Queen's men, Beith, better
          decide quickly.

                         BEITH
          One dwarf's worth a dozen tallsters, I'll
          take my time thank you --
          He suddenly stops as dozens more RIDERS appear on the hill.

                         ERIC
          You were saying?

                         BEITH
          Cut him down! MOVE OUT!
          Nion roughly cuts the line and the Huntsman drops to the
          ground as Gus gently lifts Snow White. They all hurry down
          the hill.

                         125 OMITTED 125

          126 EXT. ROCKY HILL/ CAVE - DAY. 126

          The dwarves and their captives arrive at a rocky outcrop. Duir
          and Coll pull back a large root exposing a cave entrance.

                         ERIC
          Ah, a short cut.
          All 8 dwarf heads spin at him - pissed off. Enough with the
          short jokes.
          Nion raps Eric's knee with the flat of his dagger.

                         ERIC
          Owww!!!
          Gus cuts Snow White loose.

          Nion hesitates, then reluctantly frees the huntsman. DUIR and
          COLL lead the way into a cave. Gus pulls Snow White to safety
          just as the enemy riders appear.

          127 INT. CAVE COMPLEX - DAY. 127

          From their hidden vantage point, Eric, Snow White, and the
          dwarves watch the riders searching for them. Some gallop on, but
          a small troop remain behind. Realizing they have no choice but
          to retreat further, Duir and Coll signal and the dwarves follow
          them deeper into the cave system.

          128 INT. CAVE - DAY. 128

          A shaft of light pours through the cave roof high above, BATS
          circling. The dwarves move effortlessly down the labyrinth but
          Snow White and the huntsman have to squeeze through the cracks.

          129 EXT. SANCTUARY - DAY. 129

          Snow White and the huntsman emerge from the cave to see a
          shimmering landscape of glistening moss and sunlight. It's like
          a mirage. The air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange
          HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most
          beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts:

                         NION
          Blasted fairy music. Wish I had some wax to
          stuff my ears.

                         GORT
          There's plenty of moss.
          GORT scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear
          plugs, sticking them in his ears. Snow White is still mesmerized
          by the fairy music and the shimmering haze.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is this place?
          The huntsman looks just as dazzled.

                         GUS
          They call it Sanctuary, my lady. The
          Enchanted Forest. It's the home of the
          fairies.
          And slowly the hazy curtain gives way to an enchanted forest --
          as different to the dark forest as one could imagine --
          Life grows everywhere -- LUSH GRASS, PROUD TREES COVERED IN

          BUTTERFLIES, BUBBLING STREAMS, MOSS COVERED TORTOISES, FOXES AND

          RABBITS SIDE BY SIDE, EXOTIC FLOWERS AND EVERYWHERE THE LIFE-

                         GIVING POLLEN--
          Snow White sees tiny figures flying behind the trees -- almost
          too fast to spot -- the pollen following them in long trails --

                         GUS
          Fairies.

                         GORT
          Pests.
          Of the other dwarves, only the blind MUIR seems to appreciate
          the beauty around him, enjoying the vibrations on his face.

          HEARTY, SOULFUL SINGING. Seated among the ruins, the dwarves
          sing a Celtic ballad as old as time, GUS playing the fiddle.
          Coll and Duir sit away from the others, gazing out with the
          thousand yard stare of hardened war veterans.

                         COLL
          That song takes me back to the battle of
          Tylweth Gate. A small horde versus an army.
          Pickaxes against swords and spears.

                         DUIR
          Them were the days.

                         (BEAT)
          What happened to your quailing cough?
          Coll shakes his head, "dunno". The two of them smile then join
          in the singing. A drunken GORT takes a swig of ale and staggers
          over to GUS.

                         GORT
          Play louder, you whey-face, I can still
          hear those harpy fairies.
          He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of
          tune, trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies.
          Snow White and the huntsman look on, smiling.

                         ERIC
          Legend has it dwarves were created to
          uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not
          just gold and precious stones, but the
          beauty in people's hearts.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Really?

                         ERIC
          Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever
          had it. When the Queen seized their mines
          she stole their treasure but more than that
          she stole their pride.
          And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask
          of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the song
          ends. Eric notices the tumble and chuckles.

                         GORT
          What are you pribbling at, longshanks?!

                         ERIC

          She sits on the log beside him. Gort and Nion eye her.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Thank you so much, sir.

                         MUIR
          It's only a log, no need to praise me.

                         SNOW WHITE
          No. For before. For defending me.

                         MUIR
          Your father was a good man. The kingdom
          prospered. Our people prospered.

                         SNOW WHITE
          There were more of you?

                         MUIR
          Aye.
          And that is all Muir will say on the subject. Gort fills in.

                         GORT
          One day the group you see before you went
          down into the mine for a month long
          shift. Gus was only a boy. When we came
          back to the surface... nothing. The land
          was black, everything, everyone... dead,
          gone. We searched but...
          Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out.

                         MUIR
          That was the month your father died.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'm so sorry.

                         MUIR
          As am I, princess. As am I.
          GUS walks over to Snow White.

                         GUS
          I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss,
          but would you care to dance-with a little
          'un?

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'd be honored.
          Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up.

          I don't trust her. And I don't believe
          in her, no matter what Muir says.
          Gort is still melancholy...

                         GORT
          Just you and me,... do you think there
          are any of us left? Do you think perhaps
          they were merely banished?

                         NION
          As long as the Queen's in charge we'll
          never know.

                         GORT
          Well, maybe that's the point, isn't it?
          (beat; out of the blue)
          I feel funny. Queer almost.

          I'm not sure, Beith. If I had any sense I'd
          have abandoned her long ago.
          Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance.

                         BEITH
          Muir says she's destined. Question is,
          huntsman, for whom?
          Gus and Snow White are still dancing.

                         GUS
          (As Snow White treads on his toes)
          You don't mind me saying, you got two left
          feet for a princess.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I don't mind at all, Gus. I haven't danced
          in a long, long while.
          She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching her
          with a slight smile. She smiles back and breaks away.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Do you mind, Gus?

                         GUS
          Not at all.
          Snow White walks over to the Huntsman, holds out her hand.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You've taught me to fight, surely I can
          teach you to dance.
          Eric trades a look with Beith, who nudges him on. Eric
          stands and they proceed to dance, with her teaching.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Palms up, head straight, look me in the
          eyes. And...
          The huntsman moves better than you'd imagine. His face even
          softens as they both enjoy the dance.
          Beith looks on with a smile.

          Eric and the dwarves are asleep. Flowers have grown around them,
          as if they've been asleep for months.
          Cull and Duir sleep sitting up, back to back, at the ready.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         
            68

                         131 CONTINUED: 131
          Muir, also awake and smiling, sits against the log, his hand
          rubbing his son's sleeping head.
          Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds.
          Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES,
          BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at
          Snow White.

          THE NIGHT SHIMMERS WITH FAIRY LIGHT AS THEY OBSERVE HER.
          Snow White feels the light on her face and to her surprise, she
          sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle. Two
          BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies'
          bodies, beaming at her.
          As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A
          DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall
          in alongside her.
          A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light
          crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he
          stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves.
          They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is
          the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about.
          They rise and follow to --

          AT THE TREE
          She stands BENEATH THE GIANT TREE, facing a MAJESTIC WHITE HART.
          The air around the mystical creature shimmers with a golden
          light.

                         BEITH
          No one's ever seen it before.
          The excited Muir grabs his son Quert by the arm.

                         QUERT
          The white hart bows before the princess,
          father.
          Sure enough, the HART lowers its head before Snow White. Muir's
          face is lit up in the golden light, his blind eyes shining.

                         MUIR
          It's blessing her.

                         ERIC
          What are you talking about?

                         MUIR
          You have eyes, huntsman, but do not see.
          You who have been with her the longest.
          Eric doesn't understand.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           69

                         CONTINUED:

                         MUIR
          She is life itself. She will heal the land.
          She is the one.

                         GORT
          So you're saying she is destined?...
          Muir can only shake his head.

                         MUIR
          No one listens to me.

                         (BEAT)
          Can't you feel it? Are you ailments not
          gone? Gold or no gold, where she leads I
          follow.

                         GUS
          Aye!
          The other Dwarves trade looks. Nion, the last, shrugs.
          As Snow White strokes the hart's neck, the golden light
          brightens, engulfing her.

          -- SUDDENLY AN ARROW FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- AND PIERCES THE

          WHITE HART'S FLANK.
          The HART roars in pain and bolts. The fairies and animals
          scatter in all directions now, their sanctuary violated.
          Eric looks up to see ALDAN the Yakut emerging through the trees
          on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow.
          A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading
          where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback,
          looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness.
          The huntsman grabs his axe. So do the dwarves, pulling on their
          battle masks.
          WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his bow at
          Snow White. He rides into the Yakut's horse, knocking him off
          balance just as he fires --
          The arrow narrowly misses Snow White, thudding into a tree. Gus
          grabs her by the hand.

                         GUS
          Come on!
          He runs with her into the forest.
          Aldan turns on William furiously, drawing his curved sword, but
          before he can swing the dwarves attack both men --
          Eric only has eyes for Finn. They stare at each other in the
          roaring wind, then Finn gallops into the forest after-Snow White
          Eric RUNS in the same direction --

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          William fends off the furious dwarf attack then rides off in
          pursuit of snow white --
          Aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against COLL
          and DUIR to give chase --

          132 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 132

          All around the forest the shadow of death is spreading. Gus
          runs, dragging Snow White behind him. Galloping through the
          trees, WILLIAM spots them up ahead, riding faster.

          133 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 133

          Bow and arrow at the ready, Eric runs after Finn. All around him
          the forest is darkening. He follows the sound of galloping
          hooves when suddenly they stop. He stops too, notching an arrow
          to his bow, peering into the gloom and listening.
          There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE. He
          spins around, ready to fire, when he sees it's only Finn's
          riderless horse galloping past --
          He realizes too late that it's a trick -- FINN EXPLODES OUT OF
          THE DARKNESS, catching him a glancing blow with his sword --

          134 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 134

          Coll and Duir leap up at Aldan, trying to drag him off his
          horse, but he's a ferocious fighter, driving them both back --

          135 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 135

          William spots Snow White up ahead. She disappears into the
          trees and he rides faster. She erupts from behind a branch and
          pulls him off his horse. Gus races over and raises his axe --

                         SNOW WHITE
          Gus, no!
          Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White
          recognizes the young warrior, staring at him in surprise.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I saw you at the village.
          William looks up at her, out of breath:

                         WILLIAM
          It's me. William.
          Snow White stares in disbelief, tears of surprise welling in her
          eyes. Gus looks even more confused, lowering his axe.
          William slowly rises to his feet, gazing back at Snow White,
          when THEY HEAR A TWIG SNAP --
          Gus hears it too, spinning around --

          -- To see ALDAN with an arrow notched to his bow --

                         GUS

          PRINCESS!
          Gus launches himself -- and takes the arrow meant for Snow
          White. Before Aldan can load another arrow -- William fires an
          arrow of his own, striking him in the chest. The Yakut topples
          over, dead at last but still astride his horse.
          Snow White falls to her knees in anguish, cradling the dying
          Gus. He smiles weakly, holding her gaze, then whispers:

                         GUS
          I shan't leave you, Miss.

          136 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 136

          Eric charges into Finn with a cry of rage. Finn deflects the
          blow and hurls him back into the trees. Driven by fury, Eric
          charges again, but Finn uses his anger against him, ducking
          under the vicious blow and landing a brutal one of his own --
          Eric crashes into another tree. His eyes are still full of
          hatred but his body is weak. Finn smiles in contempt from a few
          yards away.

                         FINN
          I captured many girls, but your wife was
          special.

                         ERIC
          What?!

                         FINN
          She fought and then she begged. For her
          life. Please?!!! You should know she
          called for you. Your Sara.

                         ERIC
          How do you know her name?!
          Eric is shocked, desperate.

                         FINN
          She told me. Just before I slit her
          throat.

                         -ERIC
          Bastard... .-
          Eric notices a fallen TREE TRUNK behind Finn -- dead branches
          STICKING UP LIKE SPIKES. Finn steps toward him...

                         FINN
          Now you can look for her in the other world
          and beg for her forgiveness.

          Finn smiles and raises his sword for the death blow -- when ERIC
          LUNGES. He throws himself at Finn, his momentum carrying them
          both into THE DEAD TREE'S SPIKED BRANCHES --
          The branches pierce Finn's body, their tips digging into Eric's
          flesh. Finn howls in agony --

          Finn writhes, fighting to pull himself free of the branches but
          Eric holds him down, even as the spikes dig into him, forcing
          Finn's wounds to stay open - unable to heal.

                         FINN
           Sister -- heal me!! --

           -- the SHADOWY ENERGY swirls around Finn's wounds -- but as the
           branches keep the wounds open, they cannot heal --

          141 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY. 141

           Ravenna sits at her desk - she is small and alone in the 
           vastness of the hall.
           She stares off into space, a quill in her hand - parchments laid
           out before her.
           Then suddenly her body convulses - the bottle of black ink 
           spills - dark tendrils of liquid seep across the papers and onto 
           the floor. 

                          RAVENNA
           Finn ...no! 
           She falls to the floor - writhing. 
           She fights hard at first - but then begins to weaken - her 
           power fades as she ages. 
           Then she stops. 

                         RAVENNA
          Forgive me, brother.

          142 ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 142
          Finn gasps as he feels Ravenna cut him off. Reacts in horror and
          heartbreak as his wounds stop trying to heal.

                         FINN
          Sister...
          Finn twitches for a moment, looks to Eric.

                         FINN
          I feel...
          Then the light goes out of his eyes. He is finally dead.
          Slowly, Eric pulls himself free of the branches cutting into his
          flesh.

           She has broken their connection. We pull away from her. 
           Ravenna's head is down, depleted, forlorn. Completely still. 
           Ink pools around her bony hands. But when she raises her head -- 
          We see conviction, hatred and determination.

          Still bleeding from his wounds, Eric hurries back through the
          forest until he sees Snow White and the seven dwarves gathered
          around Gus's body, chanting a low prayer. Eric stares in
          surprise, then notices William.

                         ERIC
          Who is this?
          Beith is about to reply when William answers for himself.

                         WILLIAM
          My name is William. I am Duke Hammond's
          son.

          I was looking for the princess.

          Why?

                         WILLIAM
          To protect her.

                         ERIC
          The princess is well protected as you can
          see.

          And who are you?

                         ERIC
          The man who got her this far your lordship.

                         WILLIAM
          I'm grateful for your help but I will take
          her from here.

                         ERIC
          You'll have to wait for your voice to break
          before you give me orders -
          William draws his sword in indignation and Eric draws his axe.

          Anyone can draw steel, boy. It takes a man
          to use it.
          William is about to react when Snow White turns...

                         SNOW WHITE
          Leave him, huntsman. He's our friend.
          He glares but his eyes glisten with tears. Snow White is
          still bowed over Gus's body, sobbing, mourning.
          The prayer chant ends. Nion spits with anger and walks away.

                         NION
          We need to convene.
          They all follow him a few steps away, where they have
          privacy.

          What is it, Nion?

                         NION
          This is what happens when dwarves mix
          with men. We always come out worse. We
          have big hearts and we'll fight for any
          cause -- but for what? For some new Queen
          to call us runts and turn us out of our
          homes again?

                         GORT
          I've nothing against the girl, but I'm
          not willing to risk my life for her
          either, like poor Gus.
          Beith considers quietly, the other dwarves listening too.

                         DUIR

          Not sure yet.

          What about the gold he promised us?

                         NION

          your bony neck, you jackdaw?!

          The White Hart blessed the girl.
          Nion shakes his head and rolls his eyes, but Beith listens.

                         MUIR
          Even our own legends speak of the
          redeemer who will heal the land.

                         GORT
          That little mutton?

                         MUIR
          All the lions and wolves in the kingdom
          have tried to defeat the Queen and
          failed. Why not a mutton?
          The dwarves stare at him incredulously.

                         NION
          Gus lost his life because of her!

                         MUIR
          No. He gave his life for her. As will I
          if necessary. Look at us. Look at what
          we've become.
          They trade looks. They know where he's going with this.

                         MUIR
          We were once proud, now we pilfer and
          drink and dream of when we didn't. I am
          willing to die for a chance at becoming
          the man I once was.
          And that is the last word. Quert puts his arm around his
          father and kisses his forehead. Beith and Gort trade a nod
          and a smile.

          QUERT sings a CELTIC MELODY OF LOSS as Gus is laid out on a
          funeral pyre. All around him, THE BRIGHT COLORS OF THE
          ENCHANTED FOREST HAVE FADED and there are no animals and
          fairies to be seen. It's as if Ravenna's shadow has passed
          here too. The tough, battle hardened dwarves shed tears like
          children. Snow White looks heartbroken as Beith lights the
          pyre. As the flames rise, a HAUNTING LAMENT carries us into
          the next scene ---

          William walks alongside Snow White, glancing at her tentatively.
          He waits until the others are out of earshot.

                         WILLIAM
          I'm sorry I left you.
          She looks over and sees the remorse in his eyes.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You didn't.

                         WILLIAM
          If I'd known you were alive I would have
          come sooner.

                         SNOW WHITE
          We were children, William. You're here now.
          They reach some steep rocks and Eric turns around, offering Snow
          White his hand. She takes it and he helps her up the slope.
          William looks on, feeling jealous.
          Beith follows Duir and Coll up to the summit of the hill, then
          looks at the surrounding peaks.

                         BEITH
          We'll rest the night at the top of this

          From above - Ravenna stands in the center of the room,
          surrounded by ravens. She raises her arms and they take
          flight, circling above her. She lowers her arms and their
          swirling pattern lowers, until she is completely surrounded
          by them - a tornado of ravens.
          She has become them, and they her.

          149 EXT. CAMP SITE/ MOUNTAINS - NIGHT. 149

          A FIRE CRACKLES. The dwarves have set up camp. Coll and Duir
          sit on a rocky outcrop, Coll braiding Duir's hair while Duir
          sharpens his axe.

                         COLL
          That's not how you sharpen an axe. You
          sharpen downward. Not upward..

          He raises the axe, only half in jest.

                         DUIR
          You want to test it?
          William watches Snow White warming herself by the fire, then
          heads over to Eric, who is also keeping watch.

                         WILLIAM
          It's not my place to give you orders. I
          misjudged you.
          Eric looks up. He shakes William's hand.

                         ERIC
          And I you.
          William looks over to where Snow White is.

                         WILLIAM
          We shared a childhood together, before she
          was taken away. She hasn't changed. She has
          that same light inside her. Surely you can
          see it..
          Eric looks at her.

                         ERIC
          You'd be blind not to.

                         WILLIAM
          If we can just get her to the castle, the
          people.. The people will see it. She's
          our only hope, Huntsman.

                         ERIC
          We'll get her to the castle. Don't worry
          about that..

                         WILLIAM
          I've thought about her constantly. Every
          time I closed my eyes. I can hardly
          believe I've found her.

                         ERIC -
          You should tell her. She'd appreciate it.

                         WILLIAM
          I'm afraid to.

                         ERIC
          Not telling someone how you feel and living
          with the regret is a lot worse.

          Snow White sits on a rock, away from the camp, reflecting
          quietly.
          She stares out at the surrounding mountains and valleys when
          she suddenly senses a presence behind her. She turns in alarm
          -- but it's only William.
          William smiles back gently and whispers...

                         WILLIAM
          Walk with me.
          They walk into the silver birches.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Up here it's as if nothing's changed. The
          world looks beautiful again.

                         WILLIAM
          It will be. When you are Queen.
          Snow White turns, surprised by his words.

                         WILLIAM
          The people of this kingdom hate Ravenna
          with their very fiber.

                         SNOW WHITE
          It's strange, but... I feel only sorrow
          for her.
          William is taken aback by this but pushes on.

                         WILLIAM
          Once people find out you're alive they
          will rise up in your name.
          Snow White stares back at him uncertainly.

                         SNOW WHITE
          It takes more than a name. I an not my
          father, William.

                         WILLIAM
          You are his daughter. And rightful heir.

          He steps closer, gazing into her eyes devotedly.

          If I had a choice, I would take you far
          from here. And keep you safe by my side.
          But I have a duty. And so do you.
          They hold each other's gaze, Snow White still ridden with
          doubt.

          How do I inspire? How do I lead men?

          The same way you led me when we were
          children. I followed you everywhere. Ran
          when you called. I would have done
          anything for you.
          She looks touched by his words, smiling softly, trying to
          make light of them.

                         SNOW WHITE
          That's not how I remember it.

          No?

                         SNOW WHITE
          No...
          They gaze into each other's eyes, close enough to kiss.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I remember we were always arguing. And
          fighting. And...
          She trails off, lost in his gaze. He stops, leans closer and
          kisses her gently. They stay like that a moment, then William
          pulls away, holding something in his hand. Snow White smiles
          as she sees that it's an APPLE.
          With a mischievous smile, William holds out the apple for
          Snow White, just like he did when they were children.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I remember this trick.

                         WILLIAM
          (With mock innocence)
          What trick?
          Snow White holds his gaze, then snatches the apple from him
          before he can take a bite, raising it to her lips with a
           smile. As she bites --

          Snow White staggers back and collapses in the snow, choking
          from poison. Her eyes water and her vision blurs. The false
          William kneels beside her and slowly she sees Ravenna's
          features burning through, her cold blue eyes gleaming in

                         TRIUMPH --
          A SCREAM fills the air -- not Snow White but dozens of birds

          Ravenna leans over her, smiling.

          You see, child, love always betrays us.
          A sigh escapes Snow White's lips, condensing into steam.

          By fairest blood it was done and only by
          fairest blood can it be undone. You- were

          ravens scream and pluck at his eyes but he hacks at them
          fiercely, William joining in, until the shrieking birds
          finally take to the sky and vanish on the horizon.
          Eric and William rush to Snow White's side now. The dwarves
          arrive too, hurrying through the snow.
          William cradles Snow White in his arms, trying to revive her,
          but it's no use. Eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison
          drain the color from her lips. He kneels down and gazes at
          her. William turns to the dwarves.

          What are you looking at? Help her!
          The dwarves stare back at him gravely but don't respond. He's
          desperate now, irrational --

          You are dwarves, healers, save her!
          He grabs the blind seer, MUIR, shaking him.

          Do something!
          Muir stares back at him with his empty eyes, tears glistening
          in them.
          William collapses in prayer, the light in Snow White's eyes
          almost gone. Eric looks over, sees William's grief is as
          great as his own, and finally stops fighting.
          Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say
          something, then the light in her eyes goes out.
          The dwarves are heartbroken. Eric looks dazed.
          William leans down and kisses Snow White gently on the lips.
          He pulls away,.hoping against hope. And then --
          Nothing happens. She lies there, lifeless and white as the
          falling snow.
          On all the faces - realizing that she is truly gone.

          161 INT. MIRROR ROOM - DAY. 161

          The ravens burst into the mirror room and "crash" to the
          ground. Their swirl becomes --
          Ravenna, on all fours, looking worse for wear, surrounded by
          dead ravens. The effort depleted her. She GROWLS as she
          crawls toward the mirror.

                         RAVENNA
          What must I do?! Where is she?! Where
          have they taken her?! Answer me!
          The mirror just REFLECTS RAVENNA'S weary and aging face.

                         RAVENNA

          ANSWER ME!!!!
          Nothing. Ravenna releases it all, looks up and quietly
          pleads...

                         RAVENNA
          help me...

                         MIRROR MAN

                         (MOCKS HER)
          "Help me?"...

                         (BEAT)
          There is nothing more pathetic than
          grovelling desperation. You sicken me, my
          Queen.
          The mirror starts to ripple, distorting Ravenna's face into
          something even more awful.
          161a EXT. PLAINS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 161a
          A wide shot as the group carries Snow White toward the
          castle.

          162 EXT. DUKE HAMMOND'S STRONGHOLD - DAY. 162

          Snow White's body is wrapped in a shroud, laid out on a
          funeral board. William leads it with tears in his eyes. Eric
          and the dwarves walk alongside the body, all lost in grief.

          Crowds move in to see and mourn the processional. Eric is
          careful to lower his eyes a bit to keep from being
          recognized.
          162b INT. FUNERAL CHAMBER/ DUKE HAMMOND'S CASTLE - DAY. 162b
          Torchlight flickers. Snow White's body is laid out on a
          funeral bier, her face angelic in death.

          163 INT. GENERAL'S TENT - COURTYARD - NIGHT. 163

          Tent flaps open. William stands before Duke Hammond and his
          council of LORDS, arguing his case with fierce passion --

                         WILLIAM
          She died for us! For our cause! We cannot
          hide behind these walls and watch this
          land die with her!

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          Your grief clouds your judgement, my son.

                         WILLIAM
          My grief makes me see clearly, father.
          163a INT. FUNERAL CHAMBER/ DUKE HAMMOND'S CASTLE - NIGHT. 163a
          Eric steps from the shadows up to Snow White's body, flask in
          hand. Drunk.

                         ERIC
          Here you are. Where it ends. Dressed Up
          to pretty.
          He takes another pull from the flask.

                         ERIC
          Like you're asleep; about to wake-up and
          give me more grief. Am I right?
          The he touches her arm. Feels the fabric of her funeral
          dress. Looks at her face and breaks a bit - losing the
          drunken swagger and speaking with her as if she was still
          alive.

                         ERIC
          You deserved better.
          And then he answers her...

                         ERIC
          She was my wife, princess. That was your
          question that went unanswered. Sara was
          her name. When I came back from the wars
          I carried with me the stench of death and
          the anger of the lost. I wasn't worth
          saving. But she did so anyway. I loved
          her more than anything or anyone. And
          then I let her out of my sight and she
          was gone and I became myself again. A
          self I never cared for. Until you. You
          remind me of her. Her spirit. Her
          heart. And now you, too, are gone. You
          both deserved better. And I'm sorry to
          have failed you as well.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Snow White lies pale and motionless on the bier. Eric reaches
          down and gently brushes a strand of hair off her face.

                         ERIC
          You will be a Queen in heaven now...
          He leans down and kisses her lips.

                         ERIC
          And sit among the angels.
          He finally turns and leaves the chamber, tossing the flask
          aside, disgusted with himself.
          As we listen to his footsteps fade we hold on Snow White's
          beautiful face. For a long time she stays perfectly still,

                         THEN --
          Her lips part ever so slightly, and she lets out an almost
          inaudible whisper of breath.

           Snow White's eyes open, gazing up at the ceiling, her
           thoughts far away. There's a strange calm about her now, a
           quiet acceptance, as if she knows what she must do.

          Eric, carrying all his gear, eyes down, strides toward the
          gate and a clean getaway.

                         ERIC
          Open the gate.

          PERCY (O.S.)
          Huntsman!
          Eric stops. He's been recognized. Percy catches up to him.
          They share a look and Eric sighs.

                         PERCY
          Yes, I recognized you.
          Eric sighs.

                         PERRY
          We have no quarrel with you. Not anymore.
          You returned the princess to us. And for
          that...
          He hands over a heavy sack of gold. Eric takes it, weighs it
          in his hand. God does he need it, but...

                         ERIC
          Keep your money.

          He hands it back and turns for the now open gate. He exits
          the castle and as the doors begin to close --
          SHOUTS OF JOY. Eric spins, wanders back to see what the
          commotion is all about.

          171 INT. GENERAL'S TENT - NIGHT. 171

          The council session continues. Duke Hammond stares at
          William gravely.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          My duty is to protect the people who come
          to me for help. I will defend them with
          my last drop of blood but I will not
          abandon these walls. I cannot afford to
          believe in miracles.
          He suddenly stops as the SHOUTS outside the tent get louder.
          He goes to the flap, opens it to see --
          Snow White , still dressed in her white funeral robes, stands
           at the top of the stairs that leads down into the courtyard.
          171a EXT. COURTYARD - DUKE HAMMOND'S CASTLE 171a
          Everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath Snow
          White. Her heart pounding, she makes her way down the
          stairs. All are riveted by the sight of her, as if they're
          looking on an angel or a living miracle.
          Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he, too, is
          stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd.

                         BEITH
          It's a miracle!
          Duke Hammond, embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of
          her, walks up the stairs to greet her. Several Generals
          follow him but stay a few steps below them. Hammond takes
          her by the hands as they speak.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          Your highness...
          (He can't believe his eyes)
          We thought you...

                         SNOW WHITE
          No, my lord.
          William, below, stares at her in joy while his father still
          looks dazed.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          You must rest -

                         SNOW WHITE
          I have rested long enough.
          Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I am ready to ride by your side, my lord,
          when you face the Queen in battle.
          The Duke looks speechless for a moment.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          There will be no battle, your highness.
          The best thing you can do for your people
          is stay safe behind these walls.

                         SNOW WHITE
          That is all I thought to do when I
          escaped. But I have come to learn there
          is no peace while others suffer. Have you
          not learned that?

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          The Queen cannot be defeated. She cannot
          be killed. And therefore there can be no
          victory.
          Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies:

                         SNOW WHITE
          I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the
          only one. She told me so herself.
          Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now
          her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she
          reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks...

                         SNOW WHITE
          I have been told that I represent you,
          that it is my place to inspire you. That
          is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a
          leader, not a warrior.
          Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights
          hang on her every word.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You represent me, who I've become - your
          hopes,: your courage, your will - inspires
          me.

                         (BEAT)
          I have also been told my place is not to
          fight but to stay here, safely behind
          these walls. I will not.

                         SNOW WHITE
          If Ravenna comes for me, I will ride to
          meet her. And if she doesn't, I will ride
          to meet her.
          (looks back at Generals)
          Alone if I must.
          (back to people)
          But if you would join me, I will gladly
          give my life for you. For this land and
          its people have lost too much.
          Eric and the dwarves couldn't look prouder.
          Duke Hammond stares at her for a moment, then BOWS. A beat,
          then William follows, then all the Lords and Knights. His
          eyes fixed on Snow White, Eric bows too. Then Beith. Then
          Muir and his son, Quert. Then Coll and Duir. And finally even
          Gort and Nion.
          Snow White stands alone, overwhelmed by the faith of the
          kneeling warriors, and the responsibility on her shoulders.

          The Mirror Man laughs because Ravenna's face is younger, her

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL (cont'd)
          They say the King's standard flies again.
          And now Ravenna understands -- Snow White.

                         RAVENNA
          Let them come. Let them break their
          hearts and skulls on these castle walls
          and bring my prize to me. You must not
          harm her. I need her heart -- still warm
          with blood.
          As she strides away. To soldiers --

                         RAVENNA
          Victory comes!
          178a EXT. PLAINS - WIDE - DAWN. 178a
          Hammond's army thunders toward the castle. And then they
          arrive at --

          179 EXT. SAND DUNES OVERLOOKING RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 179

          Horses crest the hill. And now, all around Snow White, we see
          her army -- not just Duke Hammond's men -- but REBELS --
          PEASANTS -- WOMEN -- all willing to follow her.
          Eric and William ride nearby. One of the Duke's commanders
          arrives to brief him.

                         DUKE'S COMMANDER
          My lord, we only have a few hours before
          the tide comes in. Not long enough to
          breach the castle walls. We'll either be
          completely exposed or drowned by the ocean.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          Is there any other way in? Tunnels? Caves?

                         DUKE'S COMMANDER
          No, my lord.
          Gloom descends on the gathering.

                         SNOW WHITE
          If we are at the portcullis when the sun
          clears the horizon it will be open.
          They all look at her.

          But how?

          180 EXT. SEA/ SEWAGE TUNNEL/ RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 180

          An unmistakable brown sludge pours out of a sewage tunnel
          into the sea. It is the same sewers where Snow White escaped.
          We hear the sound of splashing oars and grumbling:

          FROM INSIDE THE SEWAGE TUNNEL
          We look out at the faces of the dwarves, peering inside.

                         NION
          We're promised gold and volunteer for
          manure. How low has the dwarf race sunk?

                         BEITH
          Hi-Ho boys. Off to work.
          And they begin to crawl inside.

          181 EXT. BALCONY - RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 181

          Ravenna stares out. On the distant cliffs she sees the banners
          of the rebel army. A ray of sunlight pours through the clouds,
          lighting up the tiny figure of Snow White.

                         RAVENNA
          Come to me.

          182 EXT. CASTLE SEWERS - DAWN. 182

          Coll and Duir wade through the sewage, their axes held up in
          front of them, not a flicker of emotion on their faces.

                         DUIR
          Seven dwarves against an army.

                         COLL
          I like them odds.
          Behind them, Beith covers his nose from the stench, Gort and
          Nion look like they're about to be sick, and Muir and his son
          bring up the rear, the brown slime almost at Quert's mouth.

                         QUERT
          Times like this I wish I was taller.

          183 EXT. SAND DUNES OVERLOOKING RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 183

          Crashing waves break against the rocks, washing over the sand.
          Duke Hammond stares at the RISING TIDE in concern.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          We don't have much time.

          Then we should ride now. They'll have the
          portcullis up by the time we arrive.
          Duke Hammond considers, then raises his sword. Snow white
          glances at the huntsman. He breaks rank and rides closer to her.
          There's a tense silence, then the Duke BRINGS DOWN HIS SWORD and
          his riders charge down the dunes.

          184 EXT. BALCONY - RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 184

          Ravenna stares out confidently, her eyes still fixed on Snow
          White's distant banner.

          185 EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAWN. 185

          The trap door in the courtyard rises and we see Beith's head pop
          up, his expert eyes scanning the courtyard until they spot the
          portcullis. Ravenna's guards hurry past without seeing him,
          taking their positions on the battlements. Beith slips back down
          into the sewer.

                         BEITH
          The gatehouse is fifty yards away to left.
          Half a dozen guards and fifty armed
          soldiers. Archers on either side.

                         DUIR
          (Pulling out a huge knife)
          Give us a couple of minutes.

                         COLL
          Four tops.

          186 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 186

          Snow White rides across the dunes. All around her, riders gallop
          along the surf, waves crashing around them. Ravenna's castle
          comes into the view, the portcullis still down.

          187 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAWN. 187

          Coll and Duir move stealthily through the busy courtyard, so
          small and fleet they're almost invisible.

          188 EXT. BALCONY/ RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 188

          Ravenna looks on as her archers take their positions and her
          artillery men load missiles onto their trebuchets.

          189 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 189

          Snow White suddenly sees tiny dots of firelight on the castle
          walls. Eric realizes what they are and rides faster. The
          pinpoints of light soar up in the air, growing larger and
          brighter, until we realize they're FIERY MISSILES. Eric forces
          Snow White's horse out of the way as a fireball explodes yards
          from her.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         189 CONTINUED: 189
          Fire rains down on the Duke's army now, panic spreading in the
          ranks. Snow White takes her father's banner and holds it aloft,
          rallying the men and riding on.

          190 EXT. GATEHOUSE - DAWN. 190

          Two unsuspecting guards collapse outside the gatehouse. Before
          the other guards can react, Coll and Duir are on them, moving
          fast and hard, the assault over in seconds.

          191 EXT. SEWER MANHOLE/ COURTYARD - DAWN. 191

          Beith sees Coll and Duir signal from outside the gatehouse.

                         BEITH
          Come on!

          192 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 192

          Waves crash over the rocks. Fireballs explode in the sand. Snow
          White sees men falling all around her, tears welling in her
          eyes, but she never falters. As William rides on, he sees the
          castle walls through the smoke, the portcullis still down.

          193 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 193

          The GUARDS in the gatehouse look over as the door splinters and
          the dwarves come crashing through in their battle masks. Even
          though they're outnumbered, the seven fight like demons -- until
          the enemy are subdued.

          194 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 194

          On the castle walls, archers replace the trebuchets. Snow White
          holds up her shield to protect herself from the sea of arrows.
          Up ahead, the portcullis is still down, Duke Hammond's forces
          circling back as they're trapped against the walls.

                         WILLIAM
          You must turn back!

                         SNOW WHITE
          I gave my word I would stand with them!

          195 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 195

          A huge pulley controls the portcullis. Beith, Gort and Nion draw
          their pickaxes while Coll and Duir tie up the guards.

                         BEITH
          Now let's see how this works! --
          With a mighty blow of his axe, Beith shatters the chains holding
          up the pulley. The counter weights go flying down and the
          portcullis comes shooting up -- then suddenly stops -- JAMMED.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           93

          196 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 196

          The Duke's army are still circling the gates, stones and hot oil
          pouring down on them from above. Arrows slam into Snow White's
          shield but she still refuses to retreat.

          197 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 197

          Beith peers down at the jammed counter-weights in frustration
          when he hears a fierce cry. GORT jumps on the counter-weight,
          trying to bring it down. Nion follows, yellingatthetopofhis
          voice. Duir puffs up his proud chest and leapsontoo--

          198 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 198

          Snow White sees the portcullis shoot up now, the dwarves hanging
          onto the counterweights for dear life. Smiling in relief, she
          gallops through the open gates with Eric and William.

          199 EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAWN. 199

          The Duke's riders charge into the courtyard. ARCHERS fire at
          them from every corner of the castle, but they raise their
          shields and leap off their horses, forming a defensive wedge.

          200 EXT. BALCONY/ RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAY. 200

          From her balcony above the portcullis, Ravenna watches her own
          men being slaughtered; she enjoys the spectacle (Ravenna does
          not care one bit about those men). Her eyes are locked on Snow
          White.

                         RAVENNA
          Let her come to me...ALIVE!
          Ravenna's soldiers are merely there to hold Snow White's army
          back. She has planned the whole thing, calculated every move.

          Like a spider waiting in her web, with no concern about her
          soldiers' situation, Ravenna remains calm and calculated.
          Ravenna turns around and leaves the balcony to the throne
          room.

          203 EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - SAME - DAY. 203

          SNOW WHITE rushes into the castle. As soon as she passes the
          door a dozen of Ravenna's men come outside closing the trap.

          Snow White storms into the throne room. She is breathing
          heavily, a mix of fear and determination.

          KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK
          The raven claw ring, taps, resonating through the halls.
          Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs, the mirror room 
          behind her. 
          Snow White approaches.

                          RAVENNA
           I'll show you thorns!
           In a terrifying tremor, the black ceiling of the throne room 
           starts to shatter into millions of shards. 
          Snow White turns back to see William, Eric and Hammond's men - 
          the shards fall down like razor blades. 
          The men try to protect themselves. Some are caught out and 
          skewered to the stone floor. Ravenna looks down at them in 
          complete satisfaction. 

                          
          The millions of black shards circle around Eric and his men, 
          completely blocking them and keeping them away from Snow
          White.

                         RAVENNA
          Come! ... Avenge your father, who was too
          weak to raise his sword.
          The millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven 
          foot tall, razor sharp creatures. The DARK FAERIES: Ravenna's 
          ultimate soldiers.
          Snow White looks at Eric and William - unable to help her.

          Eric, William and the other men are completely surrounded by
          these creatures; they move so fast. Eric tries to step away
          from them... to no avail.
          One of the creatures rises in front of William.
          William tries to slash the creature.
          His sword goes through and the creature reforms itself right
          away. The Dark Faerie opens it's mouth and screeches.
          William gets smashed aside, saved only by his shield. The 
          Dark Faerie grabs the soldier right behind William and sends
          him crashing into the wall. 
          Snow White walks up the stairs, torn and powerless.
          She looks at Eric one last time. 
          Eric looks back as he fights off a Dark Faerie with his two 
          shields. He knows he does not have much time left but he is
          ready to make the final sacrifice.

                         ERIC
          (battle cry!)
          Kill her!
          209b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 209b
          Snow White braces herself and promptly follows Ravenna into
          the mirror room. Now Snow White is exactly where Ravenna
          wants her to be.
          The two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Ten years you locked me away!
          Ravenna seems to relish this. 

                         RAVENNA
          And every day, every hour led you to this
          ,moment. It burned inside you. It drove
          you forward, and here you are..
          Listening only to her heart, Snow White lunges towards 
          Ravenna and tries - strikes at her with her sword.
          Ravenna steps aside and with very little effort - throws her 
          to the other side of the room.

                         RAVENNA
          That's it. Fight. Fight for your land...
          for your loss and for Hope!

          Snow White slams and slides across the floor, she stops under
          the archway at the top of the stairs. She is dazed. 
          Ravenna treads on her back, then grabs her hair, pulls her 
          head up to see William and his men being massacred. 

                         RAVENNA
          Watch them die. You gave them hope and
          they believed you. You have lead them to
          their deaths. How foolish your followers.

          Eric is trying to stay alive. He rams a Faerie into a pillar.
          Shredding the stone, the Faerie explodes in shards and
          reforms immediately behind Eric.
          Grabbing the first man in sight, the Faerie throws the poor
          soldier to the other side of the room.
          on the opposite side another Faerie slides faster than the
          blink of an eye, grabs the man in flight extending it's
          cutting limbs and claws the soldier to his death.
          It is like carnage in slow motion.

          210 INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME - DAY. 210

          William is being overrun by a school of shards. The shards
          shape up into a Faerie taking William up high. In a violent
          arm blow, the Faerie projects William onto the banquet table
          six feet lower. The table shatters in splinters, William
          bouncing like a rag doll.
          Spinning around on it's way down, the Faerie skewers a
          soldier and impales another one into a pillar. The Faerie
          drags him ten feet up, tearing and digging deep into the
          stone column.

          211 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 211

           Enraged, Snow White jolts her body and frees herself from 
          Ravenna's grasp.
          She swings her sword at Ravenna. She parries every attack 
          with her bare hands.
          Snow White is breathless. One more strike... but Ravenna
          blocks it again, and this time she doesn't let go.

          (face to face with Snow White)
          You were never ready for this princess!
          Snow White struggles to get out of her lock. Ravenna is too
          strong.
          Snow White's wrist is twisted. She holds her sword tight but
          can't use it. Ravenna forces the twist. Her fragile bones
          crack. 
          Snow White screams in pain.
          The sword drops on the ground.

                         SNOW WHITE

                         (GRUNTING)
          I will... defeat... you... I am the 
          only...

                         RAVENNA
          Oh... please!
          Ravenna back hands Snow White, sending her crashing to the
          wall. SLAM! Cuts on her face. 
          Ravenna looms closer, through the fire in the middle of the 
          room. She stands IN the fire, unaffected.
          For Snow White it is a vision of pure hell. So much power, so
          much hate.

                         RAVENNA
          I have lived many lives. Ravaged entire
          kingdoms, I have been given powers you
          can't fathom. You cannot defeat ME?

                         (LAUGHING)
          Ravenna's skin blisters and heals. Ravenna raises her arms
          and black shards start to cover the walls behind her...
          entombing them in darkness... the trap closes. 

                         RAVENNA 
          But you are right... it is over. 
          Ravenna's laughter pierces Snow White like a dagger. 
          She feels powerless and lost, spitting blood and exhausted. 
          What else can she do?
          Snow White stands up, stumbles, her right arm limp, blood 
          dripping down her face. 
          She stares at Ravenna, she won't back down... she will never
          back down.

          William, stumbling upon the dead bodies of his comrades, sees
          the shards starting to obstruct the entry of the mirror room.
          He runs towards it. Eric sees him and goes for it too.
          Behind William and in front of Eric, a Dark creature shapes
          up. William doesn't see it.
          The Faerie claws William from behind through his armor,
          stopping him still and sending him backwards against a pillar
          like a stone ricochet.
          The Faerie spins it's head 180 degrees and goes from turning
          its back to Eric... to facing the huntsman.
          Eric stops and tries to pull back.
          The Faerie powers up gathering shards from another creature,
          doubling in size and density.
          Like a fire hose of black shards, the Dark Faerie unloads a
          stream of razor blades at Eric.
          Eric digs his heels in... slowly grinds and slides on the
          floor, double shields up.
          The shields are being shredded. One shield gives way
          completely torn slicing Eric's arm.
          Eric has one shield left. He kneels down... it is a matter of
          seconds.

          213 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 213

          Ravenna approaches and grabs Snow White by the throat,
          squeezing hard.
          Snow White is chocking.

                         RAVENNA
          I will never stop... I will give this
          wretched world the Queen it deserves...
          Ravenna slams Snow White down onto the stone floor next to
          the mirror altar.
          Snow White stretches for her sword as Ravenna approaches. 
          Ravenna un-sheaths her dagger. 

                         RAVENNA

                         (TO HERSELF)
          A life .for a life.

          Snow White tries to reach her sword with her left hand, but
          it is too far. She tries to drag herself a little closer... 
          still too far.
          Ravenna straddles Snow White, raises her dagger above her
          head - smiling, relishing the imminent death blow. The black
          tomb has closed in around them.
          Eric watches - despair wrought on his face -- as the knife 
          falls. 

                          

                         RAVENNA
          (in a spell incantation)
          By fairest blood it is done!
          Ravenna strikes... in the blink of an eye Snow White blocks
          her strike, reaches for her dagger and plunges it into
          Ravenna's chest, just as the huntsman taught her.
          Ravenna gasps, locks eyes with Snow White. 

                         SNOW WHITE
          (whispers to Ravenna)
          By fairest blood... it is undone!
          Ravenna looks down. Three drops of blood fall onto Snow
          White's armor.

          BOOM... BOOM... BOOM
          Ravenna stares in shock and disbelief. 

                         RAVENNA 

          NO! 
          She pulls out the dagger, her face starts to age. 
          Ravenna is aging at an incredible pace. Her body gives way
          and she slumps to the floor, below the mirror. 
          She looks at the mirror above her, gasping, reaching out, her 
          pale eyes looking for a friend, a miracle... but nothing. 
          The black shards that entombed the room start to shatter and 
          fall to the floor.

          214 INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME - DAY. 214

          William is on the ground, out of strength and has given up
          the fight. A dark creature is slowly close to reaching
          William's face with his sharp claws as William tries to hold
          the creature's arm with his bare hands, severely bleeding.

          on the ground and slices the Faerie in front of him... the
          Faerie shatters.
          William looks at Eric, in desperation begging for help. The
          two men lock eyes. A silent understanding.

          A silent pact has been made at this moment between the two
          men.
          The remaining Dark Creature freezes. Eric and William are
          barely alive.

          Snow White approaches Ravenna and kneels beside her, Ravenna
          is weak. She ages dozens of years within seconds, her face
          shows no anger, no hate, just a strange understanding.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why this? Why all of this?

                          
          Snow White, overwhelmed by compassion, places her hand on
          Ravenna's chest. Ravenna puts her own wrinkled hand on Snow
          White's.
          Ravenna smiles. She gently taps on Snow White's... in a 
          strange and affectionate motherly way.

                          
          Eric and William, exhausted and battered climb the steps of 
          the mirror chamber. It is over. 
          Ravenna stares up at Snow White's face in a shining halo of
          light above her from the ceiling.

                         RAVENNA
          (whispering to Snow White)
          See child,... we are bound.

                         SNOW WHITE
          (whispers to Ravenna calming)
          It will be all right...
          Ravenna whispers incomprehensible words with a peaceful smile
           on her face. The clouds move in the disc of light above Snow 
           White. The light falls over Ravenna's face. 
           The light fades out of her eyes and she dies.

          Packed for the coronation. Duke Hammond and Bishops surround
          her. Snow White smiles and looks out at all assembled - her
          subjects, her friends, the people she's come to know and love
          - meeting the eyes of Rose, looking young and beautiful again
          -- Anna and Lily -- the seven dwarves, who all wipe away
          tears.
          She sees William off to the side, smiling, looking on
          adoringly. But her eyes continue through the crowd, looking

                         FOR --
          Eric, in the very back of the cathedral, near the door.
          Their eyes meet, as if they're the only two in the room.
          This lasts several moments until --

                         BEITH

	FADE IN:
	INT. PROFESSOR OCK"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE
	CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY

	A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED
	WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes.

	Several DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a
	YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE.
	We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL
	climbs to "5% POWER." A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL.

	Begin OPENING CREDITS.

	THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling
	paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and
	there. COBWEBS are all around.

	DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange
	featured man in his mid-fifties.

	His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's
	open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is
	a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the
	school administration and to "procure" whatever OCK needs
	for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing
	BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS
	DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS.

				WEINER
		Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?

	With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with
	shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor.

				OCK
			(rising)
		We begin again... let's kick in that new
		transducer. See if we can double the
		power output.

				WEINER
			(rising more slowly)
		Whoa, Doc... wait a minute...

	But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls
	up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK
	looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL
	CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, "eight, nine..."
	the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is
	shattering.

	END OPENING CREDITS.

				OCK
		Okey... dokey!

	The POWER DIAL hits ten.

	EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY

	As STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills
	out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State
	University.

	We see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who's among
	the top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to
	develop a way with women.

				LIZ
			(falling in step)
		Hiya Peter...

	LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and
	intelligent.

				PETER
			(ardent but
			uncomfortable)
		Hiya Liz... how're you doing...?

				LIZ
			(teasing softly)
		How'm I doing what?

				HARRY
		Peter! Peter! Wait up!

	HARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER,
	can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty
	ones like Liz.

				HARRY
			(to Liz)
		Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?

	Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him
	away like a conspirator.

				PETER
		What is it? what...

				HARRY
		Did the Astro-Physics Journal really
		accept your paper?

				PETER
			(laughs, embarrassed)
		Yeah... well... all I got's the data but
		they've agreed to publish it when it's
		finished. You know... it's my
		calculation on the Planetary Conjunction.

				HARRY
		And its influence on the anti-force.
		Isn't it?

				PETER
		Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with...
			(indicates Liz standing
			there)

				HARRY
		Yeah, you and the rest of the class.
		Every one is busy with Liz.

				LIZ
			(growing impatient)
		Peter?

	A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom.

				FLASH
		Hiya, cupcakes...

				LIZ
			(elbowing him
			affectionately)
		Flash...!

	They kiss and walk away.

				HARRY
			(sneering)
		And Flash is the busiest of them all...

				PETER
			(disappointed)
		Come on, Harry... we'll be late for
		Octavius.

	HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.

				HARRY
		Ock is nuts, don't you agree?

				PETER
		Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But,
		a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.

	INT. CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY

	It is a basement hallway full of LOCKERS which STUDENTS
	are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take
	stuff out. In their midst, a MAN is banging on the door
	marked "Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only!"
	Professor ROSOMORF, SIXTISH, respectable, a good old
	fashioned professor, he's the head of the Physics Dept.
	With him is ALEXANDER THORKEL, a 40-ish, Waspish school
	administrator. For a scientist as crazily focused as OCK,
	THORKEL is a natural enemy.

				ROZ
			(knocking furiously)
		Doctor Octavius! You are late for your
		lecture. The students are waiting.
		Doctor Octavius!

				THORKEL
		Your friend is impossible Professor
		Rosomorf, I told the board we should let
		him go.

	The LIGHT above THORKEL's head EXPLODES. Then all the
	LIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession. THORKEL and ROZ
	look amazed...

				THORKEL
		What's he doing in there, not his crazy
		experiment again.

				ROZ
		You mean his anti-force theory... one day
		they'll give him the Nobel Prize for it.

				THORKEL
		Meanwhile he is demolishing our
		university. Octavius!!
			(knocks)
		Open the door.

	INT. OCK'S LAB

				OCK
		The anti-force experiment has now reached
		the limit of electronic overload safety.
		Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect
		the overload safety device...

	FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms)
	suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin
	working, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged
	master at manipulating these WALDOS.

	He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances
	down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT
	marked, "1,000,000"), illuminating it and filling our
	ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE.

	The knock on the door grows louder.
	WEINER comes up behind OCK.

				WEINER
		Whoa, Doc... someone's at the door...

				OCK
			(ignoring)
		World class scientific mind and they
		stick me in the basement with this third
		rate cyclotron...

	INSERT: The DIAL marked "RELATIVE GRAVITY" reads
	"1,000,000" but suddenly it snaps to "0.999999!"

				OCK
		Okey! Dokey!

	The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it
	appears to lift ever so slightly.

	INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

	This is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. The yellowing
	smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. A HUGE
	AMERICAN FLAG dominates the back wall.

	PETER, HARRY and LIZ set up their TABLES. FLASH reads the
	DAILY BUGLE sports section. PETER can't take his eyes off
	LIZ. When she looks back he looks down at his GEAR.

				LIZ
			(softly)
		What is it, Peter?

				PETER
			(embarrassed)
		It's nothing.

	INT. OCK'S LAB

	WEINER opens the door and sees ROZ and THORKEL waiting
	impatient.

				WEINER
		Yes, gentleman can I help you?

				THORKEL
		Tell your boss, that his class is waiting.

				WEINER
			(looks)
		You better tell him yourself.

	THORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder, then the both
	call.

				ROZ & THORKEL
		Professor Octavius!!

	Professor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men.

				OCK
		Gentlemen, come, you must see this.

				ROZ
		But, your students...

				OCK
		The imbeciles can wait... I have better
		things to do than teach introductory
		Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are
		kindless adolescence.

				THORKEL
		You see he is impossible.

				OCK
		Thorkel you are the dummiest
		administrator our university has ever had.
			(Thorkel turns to go)
		Don't go Thorkel!! Come! Look!

	He starts to play his machines handles and buttons.

				THORKEL
		The university pays you to teach
		something to your students.

	INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

				LIZ
		Well, do you mean nothing... or do you
		mean something but you won't tell me what
		it is?

				PETER
			(regaining)
		I mean plain nothing.

				LIZ
		Well, I guess that's about as nothing as
		you can get... plain nothing.
		A beat.

				PETER
		Liz...!

				LIZ
		Ahh, it is something.

				PETER
		No... look.

	The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They
	look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE
	begin to build...

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY

	Everything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and
	Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with
	anger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is
	blinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over
	his ears.

				OCK
		I am going for 20 percent power!

				THORKEL
		NO!! Don't do that...

				ROZ
		Ock! Its dangerous...

				THORKEL
		Ock I warn you...

	WEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks.

	INT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY

	We follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along
	the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is
	making its way up to the LAB!

	INT. LAB - DAY

	All the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating
	equipment.

	The CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ'S TABLE.
	A BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD
	LIBS: "Fire!" "Everybody out!"

	THORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing
	LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second
	to second.

				THORKEL
		Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the
		front door. Everybody out the front.

				PETER
		Liz! Come on...!

				LIZ
		I can't. Help me!

				PETER
		I'm coming!

	He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES.
	His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out.

				LIZ
		Peter!

	Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him.

				THORKEL
		Get back, you idiots. You can't go in
		there!

	LIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city
	school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz
	wraps her fingers in the GATE.

				LIZ
			(out at the street)
		Help! Help me!

	Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and
	go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the
	second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course)
	down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her.

	PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He
	fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the
	extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain.
	LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an
	eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE
	EXTINGUISHER.

	The FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out.
	FLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER.

				PETER
		Thanks for your help Flash.

				FLASH
		No problem wimp.

				PETER
		Our hero has a real way with words.

				LIZ
		Oh, why don't you grow up.

	PETER is stung, insulted, turns away.
	ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel.

				THORKEL
		This man will bring a disaster upon this
		university.

	OCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has
	happened.

				OCK
		The universe is made up of forces... and
		counter-forces. Science is the study of
		the forces!

	FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces
	FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely.
	He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on
	the last of the FIRE.

				OCK
			(continues without a
			hitch)
		But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have
		devoted my life to the study of the
		counter-forces! Good job, Peter.

				PETER
			(taking place at lab
			table)
		Thanks, Professor.

	THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the
	front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S
	behavior.

				THORKEL
		I don't believe it, I simply don't...

				OCK
		Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel.

				THORKEL
		I don't believe... oh, all right carry on
		Professor.

				OCK
		Well! This week my dear students I have
		made a stunning breakthrough...

				THORKEL
		Wait a minute, wait a minute... you've
		got fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius.

				OCK
		I have no time for forms, or
		administrators who persist in
		interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel.

	THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR.

				OCK
		I now believe its possible that these
		counter forces can be... collected... the
		way the magnifying glass collects the
		sunlight... and focused into a hard beam
		I call... Weiner!

	WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word
	that OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says "Anti-
	Force."

				OCK
		I call it, the Anti-Force!

	OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with
	a SILVER BALL inside it.

				OCK
			(continues as he works)
		This anti-force, once harnessed, is
		capable of undoing any natural force at
		which it is aimed... for instance...
			(looks up maniacally)
		Gravity!

	LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity."
	Then she turns to PETER.

				LIZ
			(whispers)
		I'm sorry...

				PETER
		It's alright.

	OCK is "playing" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the
	Opera at the organ.

				OCK
		We patch in the cyclotron...
		The lights flicker and go dim.

				OCK
		Pay no attention to the lights... I of
		course steal its energy, and it looses
		power. We patch in the cyclotron... and
		we gradually apply power. The power that
		I am stealing...

	As the WHINE builds in the LAB...
	OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it.

	The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron's
	experimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins.
	It crackles round the SILVER BALL.

				OCK
		And so we stand, four square against the
		fundamental force that orders and
		maintains our universe... gravity...
		which is holding down this goddamn ball.
		Rise!

	The LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS
	and CATCALLS.

				HARRY
		What a crock...

				PETER
		Shut up Harry... this is very interesting.

				OCK
		Mr. Parker! Have you some... interesting
		observation you'd like to share with the
		class?

				PETER
		No sir...

				OCK
		Then shut up! And pay some attention to
		the experiment.

	OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL
	begins to rise. OCK'S face is ecstatic.

				OCK
		Rise! Rise!!!

	The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of
	the box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a
	LIGHT FIXTURE.

	The shards rain down on OCK who reaches out and catches
	the falling BALL and scales it in a raised fist.

				OCK
		Now that's what I call an experiment!

	The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the
	COMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION
	BEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the
	smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front.

	TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where
	their circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK
	depiction of "space".

				OCK
		You are looking at a representation of
		two universes. Our Blue one. Our real
		universe... something we can touch and
		feel and see and draw calculations about.
		This is us. The Yellow universe... this
		is something else. Some other dimension...
		something... on the other side!

	OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the
	TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with
	each other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are
				BRIGHT GREEN.

				OCK
		If it were possible to generate enough
		power behind it, the anti-force could
		wipe out not just gravity... but all our
		universal forces at the same time. In
		effect... it would blast a hole between
		this universe and the next. Each...
			(indicates green spheres)
		would flow into each other. No blue
		universe. No yellow. End, finished,
		over.

				LIZ
			(with a student's ear)
		That sounds like a scenario for the end
		of the world.

				OCK
		My girl, it is! It is. It would mean
		wiping out everything that's known... and
		letting in everything that's unknown.

				FLASH
		Isn't that a little dangerous?

				OCK
		Don't worry yourself, true inter-
		dimensional penetration is still purely
		theoretical, but one day... Maybe very
		near... maybe in the 21st century...

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

	PETER, LIZ, FLASH and HARRY all take BOOKS from their
	LOCKERS.

				LIZ
			(whispers to Peter)
		Look, it's just... I don't know... when
		you and Flash go after each other like
		that...

				PETER
			(whispers)
		He's not my type.

				LIZ
		He doesn't have to be.

				PETER
		Check.

				LIZ
		And besides, he's not all bad.

	PETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has
	taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his
	finger with great joy and concentration.

				PETER
		You don't get nicknamed Flash because
		you're a rocket scientist, Liz.

				LIZ
		Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a
		nickname like Flash.

				PETER
		Yeah, of embarrassment.

	KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is
	a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!

				KIM
			(teasing)
		Hey, Flash... I'm scalping a pair of the
		Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow
		night.

				FLASH
		The Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!!

				KIM
		Would you pay $125?

				FLASH
		Well, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell
		you tomorrow?

				KIM
			(moving on)
		You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz...

				LIZ
		Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is
		my new roommate... Kim Nickson.

	KIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her
	LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the
	boys.

	They go bug-eyed!

				KIM
			(interested)
		Hellooo, Peter.

				PETER
			(embarrassed)
		Hi...

				LIZ
		We're going to the Student Reunion
		Meeting. You coming?

	Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's
	adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in
	the ribs. Yeah, yeah!

				PETER
			(frustrated)
		I can't... I gotta go over to the Daily
		Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos.

				KIM
		Soooh, a photographer...?

				PETER
		Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting
		you, Kim.

				KIM
		Yeah... I bet it would be.

				HARRY
		Can I be your date for the reunion
		ShooShoo?

				KIM
		No Jerk!

				HARRY
			(she turns to go)
		What did I say...

				LIZ
		It's not what you said, it's how you say
		it, ShooShoo!

	Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his
	bag down.

				HARRY
		Damn!

	PETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking
	WEINER.

				WEINER
		Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you.

				PETER
		About my data I bet.

				WEINER
		I don't know.

				PETER
		He knows about my work on the Planetary
		Conjunction, doesn't he?

				WEINER
			(lies)
		I don't know.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	PETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER. This place is a far
	cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It's a fantastic
	netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one
	but PETER.

	OCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER.
	He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is
	OCK'S domain.

				PETER
		Hello, Professor Octavius.
			(no response)
		I really admired your experiment.

				OCK
			(back to Peter)
		We have a lot of interests in common,
		Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads
		together, if you know what I mean...

				PETER
			(flattered)
		That would be... great.

				OCK
			(turns with a smile)
		Now you take the Planetary Conjunction.
		This Saturday night we will witness
		Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the
		Sun... all in a row. Never seen within
		the memory of man, or measured for its
		effect. The total gravitational force
		must be quite exceptional. Isn't that
		the subject of your paper...?

				PETER
		Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to
		calculate the combined gravitational
		effect.

				OCK
		I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think
		I could find the time to go over it with
		you. Make sure it all... checks out.

				PETER
		Well... I'm sort of working with
		Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we
		kind of keep it between us. He thinks
		that my theory is... well, I don't know...

				OCK
			(to himself)
		The scoundrel...
			(turns angry)
		I want to see that data, Peter!

				PETER
		But Professor Octavius... if I knew you
		were interested... sorry, I've already
		given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he
		is after all the head of our Physics
		Department... and I couldn't...

	OCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly.

				OCK
		Well, I'm certain something can be worked
		out. Run along, young man.

	PETER begins to leave.

				OCK
		Just a minute... how about if I show you
		my discoveries... something I never
		showed to any other student... as a
		matter of fact to anybody at all.

				PETER
		Well I am really flattered, I mean I'd
		love to... but I...

				OCK
		Very well shall we say if you come here
		tonight...

				PETER
		But Professor I don't now if I should...

				OCK
		Make it eight sharp... I'll be waiting
		for you... Right here...

	Peter looks worried then leaves.

	OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling.

				OCK
		The same academic world that's so keen to
		embrace that boy's undergraduate work,
		ridicules my anti-force theory as
		quackery. I ask you, Weiner... what is
		our society coming to? Ha!

				WEINER
		They are all a bunch of brainless
		assholes, that's what I say...

				OCK
		Weiner! Go get me that boy's data!

				WEINER
		Cost you fifty bucks.

				OCK
			(Weiner hissing)
		Just get it. We'll negotiate your fee
		when you have the data, alright Weiner?

	EXT. DAILY BUGLE - DAY

	Establish as ART DECO BUILDING well beyond its prime. A
	sign says: "The Daily Bugle." Peter enters the building.

				JAMESON (V.O.)
		Garbage! Absolute, 100% garbage!

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY

	Very forties, very messy. J. Jameson scans some PHOTOS as
	PETER stands helplessly by.

				JAMESON
		Bag ladies. I hate bag ladies.

				PETER
		Yes, sir.

	JAMESON is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top.
	He too is forties. His chewed up CIGAR is forties. This
	guy is a hard case.

				JAMESON
			(looks at the other photos)
		Little kids... I hate little kids. This
		is a daily newspaper. We need news value
		photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit!

				PETER
		Yes, sir.

	JAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with a
	MOHAWK. PETER smiles in anticipation.

				JAMESON
		Kid? You want a pro's assessment?

				PETER
		Yes, sir!

				JAMESON
			(handing photos back)
		Your photos suck.
			(cigar for emphasis)
		Parker, my readers are morons. I gotta
		grab them by the eyes. Every time you
		press the button of that Nikon of yours
		it costs you fifty-five cents. So the
		next time you're about to take the plunge,
		ask yourself, am I taking dog bites man?
		Because if you are...

				PETER
		I know, I know. You want man bites dog...

				JAMESON
		Parker, this is the post modern 20th
		century. I want man eats dog! Get out!

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A seedy east village walk up. Peter takes his camera and
	takes various shots of a wino. ALL IN. He climbs the
	stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he
	collects from a beaten down mailbox.

				PETER
			(reading)
		Rent! Rent, more bills, rent...
		electricity, bills...

	INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and
	papers. A photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen
	pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and
	lenses. Self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs,
	wind-up toys, a stuffed carp. An unmade bed and a 50's
	dinette set are the only furniture. A grimy skylight
	leads to the roof. It's not a pretty place, but it has
	personality. A voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an
	intruder, is sneaking around.

				PETER
		There's nothing in there worth stealing!

				MAY (V.O.)
			(from within the kitchen)
		That's the understatement of the year.

				PETER
		Aunt May, you're trespassing.

				MAY
			(comes in)
		I was just so desperately bored... I
		thought I'd come over and make you dinner...

				PETER
		I am old enough to... to make my own--

				MAY
		But I didn't feel like getting to know
		your roaches.

				PETER
		I'll introduce you.

				MAY
		Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots...

				PETER
		I take pictures, remember?

				MAY
		Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for
		dinner in Forest Hills...

	She grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his
	shoulder.

				PETER
		It's Friday night...

				MAY
		Yes. Do you have a date?

				PETER
		No.

				MAY
		Then come on.

	INT. LARGE COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

	It is dark and empty except for COMPUTERS. Sitting at it,
	lit by the GLOW of its screen, is SOLOMON ROSOMORF (ROZ).
	As he works, a DOOR opens behind him. Someone walks
	quietly through the LAB. ROSOMORF keeps working. The
	intruder approaches...

				THORKEL
			(at his ear)
		Professor Rosomorf, what happened here?

				ROZ
		Someone tried to rob me of some paper...
		I suspect they were looking for that one.

				THORKEL
		What is it?

				ROZ
			(unruffled)
		Award winning stuff.
			(turning slightly)
		Peter Parker's data on the Planetary
		Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my
		computer under another title.

				THORKEL
		My God, what's going on in our school?
		First Professor Octavius almost blows up
		the Physics lab... Now this. You report
		it in triplicate, of course.

				ROZ
		Thorkel, be careful when you talk to
		Octavius. Remember... the man is a very
		fragile genius. One day he'll bring us
		all the Noble Prize.

				THORKEL
		Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous
		crackpot!

	Off screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to
	build.

				ROZ
		That's him again. He's working day and
		night.

				THORKEL
		I tell you the man is very dangerous.
			(the whine grows louder)
		Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before
		this building will explode.

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK and WEINER are at work as before. OCK takes no notice
	of the TWO MEN who come in, nor the WORKER who comes in
	behind them and sets to work attaching a BIG LOCK to the
	door.

				THORKEL
		Shut it down, Octavius.

	OCK ignores him. WEINER touches OCK'S shoulder. OCK
	ignores him too.

				THORKEL
		You've blown half the circuits in the
		Science Center.

				OCK
		Call an electrician.

				THORKEL
		I have called the locksmith.

				OCK
		What... what is he doing.

	He points toward the worker who's working on the lock on
	the main door.

				THORKEL
		We have to shut your lab down and take a
		look at the lines.

				ROZ
		Please, Otto, we must lock it up.

				OCK
			(to Thorkel)
		You're denying me access to my cyclotron?!

				THORKEL
		You bet.

	OCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN, the WORKER,
	and WEINER. Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE.

	The WHINE descends.

	The WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel. The
	WHINE dies.

				OCK
			(contemplating)
		Okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow.
		I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow...
		Ha... Tomorrow you can have this room...

				ROZ
		Oh... well Thorkel... few more hours
		won't make a difference.

				THORKEL
		I hope.

	He signals to the worker to stop.

	INT. APARTMENT OF AUNT MAY AND UNCLE BEN - NIGHT

	The N.Y. Mets are playing baseball on T.V. PETER watches
	with his UNCLE BEN, a paunchy 65 years old in POLYESTER
	SLACKS and a COMFY OLD SWEATER. A N.Y. METS CAP is
	perched on BEN'S head. A BEER CAN is in his hand. A
	cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably
	around them.

				BEN
		Another brewski?

				PETER
		No, I'm fine, Uncle Ben.

				BEN
			(at T.V.)
		Yah! Way to do it. Alright!
			(to Peter)
		You don't follow the Mets like you used
		to, do you, Pete?

				PETER
		No, not so much anymore.

				BEN
		Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed
		away... I had this idea... I wanted you
		to be the best baseball player that ever
		was. Geez, what ever happened to that?

				PETER
		Little league.

				BEN
			(soft and warm)
		Yeah... Babe Ruth you wasn't.

	AUNT MAY enters.

				AUNT MAY
		It's on the table! Turn off the TV!

	BEN nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound
	off only. PETER moves toward his AUNT in the doorway.

				AUNT MAY
		How's that girl you told us about, Peter?

				PETER
		Liz? She's great... But she has a
		boyfriend.

	INT. THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	PETER passes AUNT MAY and takes his seat.

				AUNT MAY
		A boy your age should have a girlfriend.

				PETER
		Aunt May... she has a steady boyfriend.

				AUNT MAY
		Peter, any girl that's worth your
		attention is of course gonna have a
		boyfriend... But if she really gets to
		know what you have to offer she'll... you
		get my drift?

				BEN
		Look, just leave him alone, okay. When
		he's ready for girls he'll be a holy
		terror.
			(winks)
		It's in the blood.
			(now serious business)
		Lookit, how are you fixed for money,
		Pete? Maybe I can help you out a little.

				PETER
			(lying to them)
		No, I'm alright. My scholarship covers
		almost everything, and I sell some photos
		here and there. Today my physics
		professor asked for some of my work... he
		wants to study my data. They might
		publish my work in the science magazine...
		that'll bring me some money...

				BEN
			(practically cheering)
		Publish your work?! You hear that May...?

				PETER
			(embarrassed laughs)
		Yeah, in fact I have to leave a little
		early tonight, to meet Professor
		Octavius... He offered me to be his
		assistant...

				BEN
		Whoa! Did you hear that May...?

				AUNT MAY
		Oh, Peter, you promised you'd spend the
		night...

				PETER
		I... I can't, Aunt May. Professor
		Octavius wants to discuss my new
		findings.

				AUNT MAY
			(disappointed)
		Peter, what you should be finding... is a
		nice girlfriend.

	INT. BASEMENT CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	WEINER is eating a large SANDWICH and a drinking a COKE.

				OCK
		I'll show them... closing the cyclotron
		on me... Weiner!

				WEINER
		Yes, Professor...

				OCK
		Where is he? It's ten past eight o'clock...

	A KNOCK

				WEINER
			(with mouth full)
		That must be him.
		He opens the door.

				PETER
		Good evening.

				OCK
		You are late.
			(to Weiner)
		Weiner, go outside and get us something
		to eat. And don't steal it! Just buy it.
		I'll reimburse you.

				WEINER
			(to Peter)
		Do you want anything Parker?

				PETER
		No thank you, I just had dinner at my
		aunt's...

				OCK
		Piss off, Weiner!

	WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around.

	He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the
	SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open
	WINDOW... and into the chamber.

				OCK
		Okey, dokey, Parker... how would you like
		to take Weiner's place... I mean, be my
		assistant?

				PETER
		Well, Professor, that would be a great
		honor, but I'm already working with...

				OCK
		Rosomorf... that imbecile. Don't you
		understand, kid, that I am about to
		uncover the greatest discovery since
		Einstein came up with his theory of
		relativity... The "Anti-Force."

				PETER
		Wow! The theory of the Anti-force! You
		should go for the Noble Prize Professor...

				OCK
		Noble Shmoble, I am going for a much
		bigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me
		show you, kid, what I got here.

	OCK begins the experiment. We move in past the shattered
	WINDOW. We see the SPIDER crawling on the chamber's GEAR.

				OCK
		Present maximum anti-force power to date
		is 38 percent of theoretical limit. I
		have patched in the variable
		particle-wave accelerator...
			(shrugs)
		I will now try to reach 50% power...
			(big breath)
		And if your paper has any value... I can
		use it to get the power I'm missing to
		create the anti-force, to break through
		and beat any other form of power in our
		or any other universe, capish!

				PETER
		Sorry, Professor, I can't do it. I gave
		my word to Professor Rosomorf.

	OCK is angry... Ock now sees the SPIDER. He shoots out a
	WALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast. The
	WALDO slams against the wall of the chamber. He starts to
	push every button or switch in sight. A deafening whining
	starts.

	An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the "Relative
	Gravity" DIAL. It is at "4.999999KG" but suddenly the
	numbers start to tumble rapidly.

	INSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT.
	INSERT: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER!

				OCK
			(screaming)
		50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent...
		that's all I'm missing! Parker, we can
		be rich together!

				PETER
		Sorry... I'd better go now.

				OCK
			(really angry now)
		You'll be sorry, Parker.

	PETER leaves.

	Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the
	monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word,
	"OVERLOAD!" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward!
	The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Incredibly lit, the SPIDER is dropping on it's shimmering
	WEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in
	time with the THROB and PULSE.

	INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The MONITOR is flashing "MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN!"
	OCK continues with the experiment. And then he sees the
	SPIDER!

				OCK
		You! Get out of there, you creeping...

	He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Through the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the
	other side if the shattered WINDOW. He sends TWO WALDOS
	after the SPIDER. The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto
	the PROFESSOR's back. It then climbs onto the PROFESSOR's
	neck and bites him.

				OCK
			(anguish)
		Noooooooooooo!

	The gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as
	OCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode
	or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which
	erupts like the 4th of JULY.

	OCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A
	DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a
	Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like
	snakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES!
	OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is
	pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with
	SPARKS.

				OCK
			(ecstasy above the din)
		It's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey!

	We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck.
	The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions,
	valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where
	they twitch and writhe with a life of their own.

	Then, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the
	CYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO-
	STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Ultimate weirdness! The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT
	penetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then
	the very walls! LOCKERS bang, LAMPS POP, the ceiling sags
	in a SURREAL, RUBBERY way.

	The WALLS sag too! The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds
	itself in a WALL. A LADDER sinks in the WALL. The BLUE-
	WHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES. Then,
	suddenly, it stops... DEAD SILENCE. WEINER comes running
	in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of
	Pepsi. Weiner enters OCK'S lab, singing, not at first
	noticing what's going on. Suddenly he stops dead.

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	A scene out of DALI's surrealistic canvas. There are
	things inside of other things. DIALS look like DALI
	watches. This place has been rippled to the max!
	OCK lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a WALDO across
	his chest. The SPIDER is weaving its web. CAMERA slowly
	DOWN to see OCK. PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body.
	The WALDO seems to be wrapping him. He wakes up to see
	those MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body. They weave
	around him as if they are looking for prey. He tries to
	tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body,
	like his other limbs. He screams. Suddenly Weiner sees
	OCK.

				WEINER
		Professor... what happened to you? What
		did you do...

	Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he
	flies back and out through the door to the corridor.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

				WEINER
		Oh my God... what happened here...

	He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away.

				WEINER
		I better get out of here.

	EXT. THE EMPIRE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	The long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN. A COP CAR pulls
	to a halt in front of the COLLEGE. Many NYPD CARS are
	already there, along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN, some
	AMBULANCES, a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
	and TWO TV VANS. ROZ runs across the lawn.

	POLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press, students
	and general gawkers.

	J. JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see
	TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it.
	The MAN shakes his head. JAMESON throws down his CIGAR,
	stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. THORKEL arrives to
	address the CROWD.

				THORKEL
			(through bull horn)
		There is no danger. Please go back to
		your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger.

				JAMESON
			(approaches him)
		Spill it out, Professor! The public
		wants to know!

	The CROWD closes on THORKEL.

				THORKEL
		Who are you?

				JAMESON
		Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now
		what really happened here?

				THORKEL
		There will be a press announcement in the
		morning Mr. Jameson... now if you'll
		excuse me.

	This elicits a flood of AD LIBS: "I heard a terrible
	explosion?" "Nuclear accidents?" "Meltdown?" "Genetic
	engineering?" "Are you guys making mutants in there?"

				THORKEL
		I have nothing to say... there will be an
		announcement. Now, please go home...
		everybody... we must clear the grounds...

	In the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and
	KIM.

				FLASH
		You think they'll cancel classes?

				HARRY
		They must... the whole building must be
		contaminated with some kind of poisonous
		gas.

				PETER
		How about nuclear contaminations?

				KIM
		My God... lets beat it.
		But nobody moves.

				LIZ
			(more interested in other
			things)
		Could anyone be in there, Peter?

				PETER
			(concerned)
		I don't know... Maybe Professor Octavius.
		He usually works late...

				FLASH
		That nut, I bet it was all his doing...

				JAMESON
			(seeing Peter)
		Hey Parker! Peter Parker!

	PETER pushes forward.

				PETER
		Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here?
		What's going on?

				JAMESON
		That's for them to know, and for you to
		find out.

				PETER
		But sir, they wouldn't tell us. You
		heard Thorkel... he said...

				JAMESON
		A press announcement tomorrow...! But we
		must know tonight Parker. This is your
		university, right...

				PETER
		Yes, but...

				JAMESON
		You got your camera?

				PETER
		Sure, but I can't--

				JAMESON
		A hundred dollars says you can?

				PETER
		Yes sir!

				JAMESON
		Get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks.

				PETER
		You just said a hundred.

				JAMESON
		Seventy, but I want blood and gore.

				PETER
			(calling back)
		Seeya guys.

	He dashes off. FLASH shakes his head in dismay at this
	guy.

				LIZ
		Where is he going?

				JAMESON
		To make fifty bucks.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	PETER approaches a CYCLONE FENCE keeping low and out of
	sight. He leaps it like a skirmisher but fails
	ignominiously in a heap. He's torn his PANTS and cut his
	leg. He moves to the side of the building.

	A DUMPSTER sits next to a FIRE DOOR. It's locked. As
	PETER mulls over his next move, the LOCK clicks and the
	DOOR slowly opens. PETER leaps on the DUMPSTER... and
	falls in.

	INT. DUMPSTER - NIGHT

	PETER lays in the GARBAGE, a pained look on his face. He
	rolls over and comes face to face with a wet DAILY BUGLE.
	The headline reads, "Wave of Violence Rips City!" He pulls
	himself up and peers out.

	He sees a UNIFORMED GUARD hold the DOOR open for THREE MEN
	IN RADIATION SUITS who remove some weirdly fused objects.
	When they let the DOOR swing closed, PETER stops it by
	inserting the NEWSPAPER in the top.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	PETER squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the
	NEWSPAPER. The Door closes behind him.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Skewed, strange, surreal, PETER stares at the weirdness
	and fumbles with his CAMERA. He snaps off a few shots,
	then freezes when he hears a familiar voice.

				ROZ (V.O.)
			(filtered through face mask)
		Take it easy. Take it easy with him.

				THORKEL (V.O.)
		Take him away and never bring him back!

	Now we see ROZ and THORKEL following 2 GUARDS carrying OCK
	in a stretcher. They all wear RADIATION SUITS. A waldo
	sneaks out from under the sheet and hits Thorkel, as fast
	as lightning. He falls back. He's covered with a SHEET
	and attached to LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. Octavius moans.

				THORKEL
		What was that?

				ROZ
		What was what?

				THORKEL
		What hit me?

				ROZ
		What hit you?

				THORKEL
		I don't know. It was so fast.

				ROZ
		You're going to be fine, Otto.

	PETER gets off a shot and ducks into the MEN'S room
	leaving the DOOR ajar for a peak.

	A WALDO slips down from the SHEET. PETER'S eyes go wide
	at the sight. What in the hell has happened here?

	INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The URINALS are twisted in bizarre shapes. PIPES are
	exposed and spout WATER. The MIRRORS look like something
	out of a funhouse. PETER hears the STRETCHER go by.
	PETER goes to the DOOR of OCK'S Lab and cracks it. PAN up
	to the SPIDER, GLOWING softly, dangling from a SHIMMERING
	STRAND above PETER.

	As PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on
	his neck. He reacts by swatting it away. Bad move.
	The GLOWING SPIDER now squats malevolently on the back of
	PETER's hand. He stares at it transfixed. It bites.

				PETER
		Ow!!!

	PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it
	scuttles unsteadily out the door.

	Sweat starts to bead on PETER'S face. He shakes his head
	to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches
	against a WEIRD SINK.

	PETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not
	just moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that!

				GUARD (V.O.)
			(heavily distorted)
		Hey! What are you doing here, kid?

	PETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his
	crazy vision.

				PETER
		I feel a little funny...

				GUARD
			(heavily distorted)
		Yeah? Well, I ain't laughing. Get out...
		Just get out of here...

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	It bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws
	his BACK PACK at him.

				GUARD
			(still distorted)
		You get yourself over to the Police lines.

				PETER
			(ultra wooz)
		Right. Police lines.

	EXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	PETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON
	appears at his side.

				JAMESON
			(distorted)
		Okay, scoop, whaddaya got?

				PETER
		I... got pictures of the Professor... in
		there... it's so strange in there... so
		bizarre...

				JAMESON
			(winks)
		Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need.
		Pick this up in the morning.
			(holding up his camera)
		There'll be two crisp twenties tucked
		inside.

	He hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden
	his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is
	gone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to
	the street.

	We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind
	him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN.

	An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits
	PETER who leaps to avoid it.

	EXT. BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT

	PETER'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his
	eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the
	building like a spider. And he's three stories up!
	He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him!
	And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away.
	He tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and
	crashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And
	then another.

	Tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he
	"crawls" to the roof of the building. At the top he
	gropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories
	above the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the
	roof one-handed.

	EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

	PETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits
	up and looks wonderingly at his hands.

	On the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS
	surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW
	disappears.

				PETER
			(mutters to himself)
		This is weird. My God, I feel so weird...

	He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good
	Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of
	"jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the
	air!

				PETER
			(exhilarated)
		Very weird.

	The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as
	PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air.
	With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps
	from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL
	where he lands sideways and sticks.

				PETER
			(sideways)
		Very, very weird.

	He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof.
	He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a
	step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.

	EXT. ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT

	PETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and
	across the street. PETER bites his lip.

				PETER
		Well, what the hell!!

	EXT. THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT

	Backlit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of
	the taller building, and misses the top!

	He sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs
	with the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty
	BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way
	and that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT
	down the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws
	into the room.

	EXT. CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT

	The MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST
	and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED
	LIGHTER.

	In the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off
	the taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time
	to see PETER make it to the next FACADE.

	EXT. ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT

	With the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to
	the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop.

	Watching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT
	follows PETER'S progress.

	PETER leaps to a BROWNSTONE and lands amid the WASH.
	He leaps up to a TENEMENT and lands on a BILLBOARD across
	which he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again.

	He touches down on a PIGEON COOP and bounds up and out of
	frame again. The COOP OWNER, a LATINO in an undershirt
	and a YANKEES CAP, comes running out of the COOP.

	He's so surprised that he leaves the DOOR open and twenty
	WHITE MORNING DOVES fly away in a furious flapping, free
	at last. The LATINO lets out a stream of Hispanic
	expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene
	gestures.

	PETER slides down a CABLE to a LAMP POST, and swirls down
	the POLE to a PHONE BOOTH.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

	PETER comes face to face with the man in the LOUD
	SPORTCOAT. He gives PETER his CARD.

				REISS
		You're a kid who's going places, and I'm
		gonna point you the right way.

				PETER
			(reading card)
		Max Reiss, models, strip dancers, escort
		girls, blue movies...

				REISS
		Oops... sorry, wrong card.
			(exchanges cards)

				PETER
		Max Reiss, Talent management.

				REISS
		It's a big outfit. Got a lot of
		departments.

				PETER
		Yeah... well... why you approach me? I'm
		not...

				REISS
		Oh yes you are... very talented. The
		three questions of show business success.
		One do you think you possess a unique
		talent?

				PETER
		Well...

				REISS
		Two... what are you gonna do with it?

				PETER
			(not a clue)
		Well... I don't know.

				REISS
			(the clincher)
		Three... how much money you got in your
		pocket?

				PETER
		Ten.

				REISS
		You invest half of that with me and I'll
		make you a star.

				PETER
			(laughing)
		What are you talking about?

				REISS
		I'm talking about fame. I'm talking
		about fortune. I'm talking about the
		chance of a lifetime. How'd you like to
		be on MTV tomorrow night?

				PETER
		MTV...? Me? Really?

				REISS
		Taxi!

	It screeches to a stop.

				PETER
		Hey!

				REISS
			(getting in)
		Kid! Tomorrow night. Same place, same
		time.

				PETER
			(calling after)
		How do you know I'll show up?

	As the TAXI roars off...

				REISS
			(from the taxi window)
		Because you wanna be a star... everybody
		does.

	PETER pulls out a QUARTER. And enters a phone booth. He
	dials.

				PETER
		Hello? Aunt May?

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Peter? What time is it? Are you alright?

				PETER
		Well, no, I mean yeah I'm fine, but
		listen... Aunti, the craziest thing
		happened to me tonight.

	INT./ EXT. PHONE BOOTH/AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As UNCLE BEN stirs fitfully

				AUNT MAY
			(lovingly)
		Does this have to do with a certain girl
		we talked about at dinner?

				PETER
		No, no, look, there was this radioactive
		experiment... I was poisoned!

				AUNT MAY
		You were what?

				PETER
		I was bitten by a bug.

				AUNT MAY
		Oh! I get it, you mean a love bug.

				PETER
		No... No... A spider...

				AUNT MAY
		Peter, did you at least talk to her?

				PETER
		Aunt May, listen to me. I got bitten on
		the hand... by a poisonous spider.

				AUNT MAY
		She bit you?

				PETER
		No. I was in the bathroom and...

				AUNT MAY
		Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter,
		this is craziness, why don't you use your
		bed? You're up all night. You're in the
		radioactive labs. You never take time to
		eat or sleep. Am I right?

				PETER
		Yes, Aunt May.

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)
		Did you eat something today?

				PETER
		Yes, Aunt May.

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)
		Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember
		we love you.

				PETER
		And I love you too, Aunt May.
			(hangs up)
		And by the way, I got a mess of super
		powers today.

	Exit booth. He BANGS the PHONE BOOTH. Goes out and--
	jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof.

	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK is prepped for surgery. GOWNED PERSONNEL hurry about
	with a feverish urgency. The CHIEF SURGEON checks the
	SENSORS attached to OCK'S head. These seasoned
	professionals are astonished and frightened.

				CHIEF SURGEON
			(whispers)
		Look at these brainwave readings. The
		mental activity is ten times of any
		normal man...!

				BRAINMAN
			(whispers)
		Equipment malfunction...?

				CHIEF SURGEON
			(whispers)
		Hell, yeah... his.
			(checks Ock's chest)
		My God... I thought I'd seen everything...

				SURGEON #2
			(whispers)
		But this is beyond medicine. This is
		madness...!

	OCK lays bare chested, face up, all FOUR WALDOS splayed.
	He is a true cyborg. Part man, part machine. Part
	organic, part molybdenum steel.

				NURSE
			(leaning in, blitzed)
		It is so freaky...

				CHIEF SURGEON
			(stern for the staff's
			sake)
		Okay, lets stop yakking and get cracking.
		I want to go in at the upper thoracic.
		Then we'll work our way around.
			(slaps Ock's shoulder)
		Hang in there, man.

	INSERT: The WALDO nearest the slap moves ever so slightly.
	The triangular CLAW rotates a quarter turn and then turns
	back.

	The NURSE sees it and SCREAMS.

				CHIEF SURGEON
			(glares)
		Nurse! Number seven scalpel.
		Arthroscope stand by. Read out
		parameters in progress. Let's go in.
		You alright?

				NURSE
		Yes... Yes, of course. Everything's
		online.

				CHIEF SURGEON
		Scalpel! No... no... a larger one...
		the largest we have!

	She slaps a HUGE ONE into his palm. He takes a deep
	breath and goes to work. MASKED heads gather round him.
	The SCALPEL is poised at the line where skin meets steel.
	We make an incision. The INSTRUMENTS go crazy. WARNING
	BELLS and BUZZERS sound.

				HEAD NURSE
		Kill the alarms!

				BRAINMAN
		He's going off the chart!

	A WALDO flashes around the steel leg of the operating
	TABLE and clanks tight!

				CHIEF SURGEON
		Mop. Mop! Sutures and clamps! Hurry up!

				SURGEON #2
		We're losing him. Defibrillate!

	A HEART MACHINE is rushed in. They work frantically.

				CHIEF SURGEON
		Zap him!

				BRAINMAN
		Stabilizing alpha waves...

	SURGEON #2 applies the CARDIAC SHOCK PADS.

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

				NURSE
		You have a visitor, Doctor...

	She leaves OCK and THORKEL alone.

				THORKEL
			(enjoying this)
		Octavius, I'm afraid I have bad news for
		you.

				OCK
		The cyclotron is damaged...

				THORKEL
		What used to be the cyclotron was
		permanently shut down this afternoon.

				OCK
		But my work!

				THORKEL
		Your work is a disaster! Look at
		yourself!

				OCK
		Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters
		anymore. To enter a new dimension we
		must first destroy our own...

				THORKEL
		What are you saying?

	OCK gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with
	his 4 WALDOS and 2 arms.

				OCK
		Destroy life. Life is... insignificant.
		Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What
		would you say?

				THORKEL
		Oh, my God, what are those horrible
		things sticking from your body?

				OCK
			(gets more and more excited)
		Thorkel, if I told you that for one
		moment in time I broke all the laws! For
		one brief glorious moment, I broke
		through to the other side. I saw... I
		felt... I became creation.

				THORKEL
		What on Earth are you rambling about?

				OCK
		Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so
		clearly now. Universal destruction, yes.
		All I need is the power... then I can
		destroy this illusion you call life. It
		is my destiny to lead us to the light!

				THORKEL
		You're a madman.

				OCK
		And you are a fool. I will end the
		universe as you know it. And in that
		final moment... I'll laugh my ass off
		while you're kissing yours goodbye!

				THORKEL
			(excited)
		Goodbye is right, Octavius... You're
		fired... sacked... canned. You are
		history, Doctor Octavius. And I couldn't
		be more pleased to be the first to tell
		you this good news...

	A WALDO shoots up and grabs THORKEL by the throat. He
	GASPS and SCREAMS silently as the telescoping WALDO lifts
	him off his feet. He rises until his head is just inches
	from the ceiling.

				THORKEL
			(his last words)
		Let me down Ock... you crazy... MONSTER!
		Let me down!

	Then OCK smiles and slams THORKEL'S head through the
	ceiling. PLASTER rains down. THORKEL'S legs scissor and
	kick and then go limp. OCK throws his dead body on to the
	bed, and covers him with the WHITE SHEETS.

				OCK
		Okey, dokey.

	INT. TAXI - NIGHT

	Through the WINDOW of the TAXI we see MADISON SQUARE
	GARDEN.

	As it pulls up, a sign reads, "Midnight Madness! MTV's
	Rock and Wrestling 'SLAMMY Awards!" The TAXI come to a
	stop.

				PETER
			(looking up at the sign)
		MTV Wrestling?!

				REISS
			(getting out)
		That's the place. Pay the man.

	MAX REISS gets out, he is carrying a BOX.

				PETER
		Look, Mr. Reiss... I'm not real
		interested in watching a wrestling match.

				REISS
		Who said anything about watching a
		wrestling match? You're here to win a
		wrestling match!

				PETER
		Me? You must be kidding.

	REISS hustles PETER inside.

				REISS
		You hop around. You know, the way you
		did last night. Your opponent gets tired.
		He falls down. The ref counts to three,
		you win, and we pick up a thousand bucks.

	INT. CATACOMBS MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

	We can hear the CROWD screaming at something in the
	background as REISS leads PETER to an employee WASHROOM
	and shows him the BOX.

				REISS
		You're really gonna love this.

				PETER
		Look, really, I don't know...

				REISS
		You don't have to know. I know enough
		for both of us.
			(pause)
		Change in there.

				PETER
		What is this?

				REISS
		A costume... something that fits your
		talent. Go put it on. I'm sure you'll
		like it.

	He slaps the BOX against PETER'S chest and all but pushes
	him inside.

	INT. WASHROOM - NIGHT

	PETER takes the suit out of the BOX. It is the SPIDER-MAN
	SUIT! He looks at it and shrugs. Then he begins to
	struggle into it.

	PETER is looking at himself in the MIRROR. He is dressed
	in all but the MASK. And he looks terrific! He flexes.
	He smoothes his hair. He's starting to get into it.

	INT. THE ARENA - NIGHT

	CRUSHER COLE is destroying an opponent.

	INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

	REISS winces as the CROWD CHEERS and BOOS.

				PETER
			(comes out)
		How does it look? I feel like it's
		Halloween.

				REISS
		Cover your face with the mask.

				PETER
		Why?

				REISS
		Mystery, my friend. Nobody should know
		who you are...

	INT. THE RING - NIGHT

	CRUSHER COLE is doing a big flexing number and the CROWD
	is going wild. There are MTV CAMERAS and SIGNS and
	BANNERS proclaiming the "SLAMMIES" everywhere.

				RING ANNOUNCER
		And now, a new challenger, for the
		thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one
		hundred and fifty pounds... from parts
		unknown! Here is the Amazing...
		Mysterious... Incredible Superman...

				REISS
			(snorts from ringside,
			hating the name)
		No, not Superman... Spider-Man...
		SPIDER-MAN!!!

				RING ANNOUNCER
		...Spider-Man!!!!!

	The CROWD BOOS the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly
	through the ropes. Rock music blares. TWIN REDHEADS in
	RED BIKINIS ring a bell.

	CRUSHER COLE and SPIDER-MAN circle. COLE is twice
	SPIDEY'S size. SPIDEY spots a TV CAMERA for the first
	time. He momentarily freezes. CRUSHER sneers the CRUSHER
	sneer. Then he charges!

	With the agility of a spider, SPIDEY leaps out of the way.
	CRUSHER comes back at him. SPIDEY leaps again, bigger!
	The acrobatics get more and more dramatic as CRUSHER COLE
	works himself up into a theatrical rage. Taunts erupt
	from the CROWD.

				OLD LADY
		Kill the sucker, Crusher!

	SPIDEY, really getting into it now, begins playing for the
	CAMERAS.

				HIPSTER
			(between two blondes)
		Whatsamatter, Crusher, can't you crush
		that bug?

				CRUSHER
			(to Spidey)
		Okay, Web Face, this is it!

	He misses SPIDEY again!

				HIPSTER
		Hey, Crusher, you need a insecticide!
			(his blondes titter)

	INT. LIZ/KIM'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

	LIZ'S side is all schoolwork. KIM'S side is all ROCK
	POSTERS and STUFFED ANIMALS. LIZ is curled up doing
	homework. FLASH and KIM sit on the edge of the bed
	watching the "SLAMMIES" on MTV.

				FLASH
		Will you look at this Spider-Man guy! He
		is absolutely incredible!

				KIM
		Liz, get a load of this outfit! I wish I
		had it for the Halloween party... it's
		quite sexy.

				LIZ
		Will you two shush. I'm trying to work.

	INT. RING - NIGHT

	The match continues in an increasingly spectacular
	choreography. CRUSHER bellows at the SCREAMING CROWD.
	But there's a gleam in his eye. This is it!
	He charges. SPIDEY, playing the CAMERAS for all he's
	worth, leaps way, way up. But this time CRUSHER stops
	dead in his tracks. SPIDER-MAN comes back down into a
	forearm SMASH that sends him reeling into a corner.
	CRUSHER does a flying pin. 300 pounds. WOMP! The air
	leaves SPIDEY in a rush as CRUSHER covers him, smothering
	him. The CROWD goes WILD.

				REF
		One...!

				REISS
		Get up...! Get up...!

				REF
		Two...!

	Not realizing his own strength and panicky about being
	squashed, SPIDER-MAN throws CRUSHER COLE off him and up
	into the air. Way up! Reiss cheers... Spider-Man comes
	down and knocks CRUSHER for the first time.

	CRUSHER flies away and out of the arena, eight rows back!
	The HIPSTER sees CRUSHER coming at him and bolts from his
	seat. CRUSHER lands on it, in between the TWO BLONDES who
	break into utter hysterics.

	SPIDEY, surprised at his own strength, watches CRUSHER
	land.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(whispers to himself)
		Wow...

				REF
		Ladies and Gentlemen, history is made
		today, we have here the first man to win
		a thousand dollars against the mighty
		Crusher.

	The REF raises his hand in victory. The CROWD BOOS and
	DEBRIS rains down. But some in the CROWD CHEER wildly,
	recognizing the new sensation.

	SPIDER-MAN steps down from the right as REISS leads the
	CHEERS.

				PETER
		Max! Am I really gonna get a thousand...

				REISS
		We are going to get a thousand--

	PETER turns with REISS and comes face to face with CRUSHER
	COLE. Two ominous beats.

				CRUSHER
		Hi, who are you, kid?

				PETER
		I'm Peter Parker.

				REISS
		He is Spider-Man, and I handle him...
		Whenever you want a rematch call me.
		Next time it's gonna be ten thousand,
		what do you say... Crusher?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I'm really sorry
		about what happened in there. Really...

				CRUSHER
		Oh, well, I don't know what happened to
		me tonight...
			(measures his muscles)
		I really don't know...

				REISS
		I know... you lost. Big man you lost to
		the Amazing Spider-Man.

	EXT. CITY STREET - NEAR A HOSPITAL - DAY

	WE ARE TIGHT ON A NEW YORK JOURNAL TRUCK. On its SIDE
	BANNER is a PICTURE of SPIDER-MAN'S face. Headline: "Who
	is he? Mega-Smash Hits MTV!"

	The TRUCK pulls away and we see PETER, LIZ, HARRY and KIM
	standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. PETER is
	rocking on his heels and smirking.

				PETER
			(indicating truck)
		You know who that is?

				LIZ
			(walking ahead)
		Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last
		night... boy does Flash think he's hot.

				PETER
		He does...

				KIM
		I love wrestling.

				HARRY
		Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really
		believe this little guy in a stupid
		Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher?

				LIZ
		Hey, we better rush... visiting hours
		will be over soon.

	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR & ROOM - DAY

	The NURSE leads PETER and LIZ and HARRY into the room.

				NURSE
		Doctor Octavius? You have visitors.
		Doctor Octavius?

	We hold for a beat. When LIZ takes a step forward to look
	around we expect the worst. But nothing grabs her.
	PETER sees a pile of PLASTER on the floor. He looks up
	and sees the hole in the ceiling. LIZ and HARRY look up
	too. OCK is not there.

				PETER
		Ock is not here!

				LIZ
		My God, what happened?

				NURSE
		I'd better call the doctor!

				HARRY
		You'd better call the police!

	KIM screams.

	INT. CORRIDOR TO OCK'S LAB - DAY

	OCK, hiding his WALDOS under a white hospital robe. He
	stalls until he reaches the door. Then one of his WALDOS
	peaks out and snaps open the new locks on the door.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK, in a white hospital robe walks through the surreal
	debris. Two WALDOS reach out and "sense" the ripples on
	opposite WALLS. He runs a hand through his hair.

				OCK
		What a wreck. What a useless, wasted
		wreck. Okey, dokey. We rebuild you, my
		damaged darling. Bigger, better, hotter!
		A world class, super cyclotron!

	He hears a NOISE behind him and reacts. And here comes
	WEINER. Bedraggled, shuffling through the CONTROL ROOM
	door. He eyeballs the incredible wreckage.

				WEINER
		There you are, doc... where have you
		been... whoa this place is messed up.

	OCK turns, WALDOS writhing. WEINER sees them and kind of
	ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once.

				WEINER
			(smirks)
		Whoa, doc! You look a little messed up
		yourself.

				OCK
		Where have you been, you imbecile?

				WEINER
		I went to the wrestling...

				OCK
		Wrestling...

				WEINER
		I went after the kid. You still want
		that Parker guy's data, don't you?

				OCK
		Well, did you get it?

				WEINER
		No, I followed him... but I lost him in
		the crowd.

				OCK
		Lost him? You--

				WEINER
		I'll find him, Maestro... I promise...
		soon... maybe by tomorrow.

				OCK
		So how was the wrestling?

				WEINER
		Fantastic! There was this new wrestler...
		beat the mighty Crusher. You won't
		believe it... a nothing of a guy... calls
		himself this stupid name... the Amazing
		Spider-Man... would you believe it?

				OCK
		Spider-Man, huh? Well, maybe I'll just
		go and wrestle myself one of these days...
		with all my new arms... I'm sure I can
		beat Crusher or any other monster.

	Suddenly OCK throws out his WALDOS from under his long
	white coat, grabs WEINER and, lifts him up in the air,
	smiles cynically and with cruelty!

				OCK
		Will I beat him, this Crusher, will I
		beat him or not?

				WEINER
		No... no, please... I mean yes, yes...
		you'll beat him easily... let me down...
		Please... I'll do anything for you...

				OCK
		The Parker data... get me the Parker
		data, you hear?!!!

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOFTOP - DAY

	A CAMERA is mounted on a TRIPOD facing us. A TIMER winds
	down and it CLICKS.

	REVERSE ANGLE - CAMERA'S POV.
	SPIDER-MAN is clinging to the side of a WALL.

				SPIDER-MAN
		And one like this...
			(changing pose)
		And one looking real sincere.

	The WHITE EYES narrow to a slit. CLICK.
	Suddenly he spots WEINER climbing onto his roof. He
	hides.

	WEINER tiptoes into the roof apartment. SPIDER-MAN jumps
	in and grabs him.

				SPIDER-MAN
		What are you doing here?

				WEINER
		I'm looking for Peter Parker.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Oh, yes... so why not use the front door?

	SPIDER-MAN throws him back onto the roof so that he almost
	slides over the edge. WEINER turns, facing SPIDER-MAN.

				WEINER
		Hey, I know you...

				SPIDER-MAN
		You do?

				WEINER
		I saw you crushing the Crusher.

				SPIDER-MAN
		You like wrestling?

	SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER.

				WEINER
		I love it! You are the best wrestler I
		have ever seen... please don't hurt me!

	SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna
	above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately.
	SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna.

				WEINER
		Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help
		me down.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Of course I'll help you down. I am
		Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not?

				WEINER
		Yes... yes, you are.

	SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his
	arms and whispers to him.

				SPIDER-MAN
		And by the way, Peter Parker does not
		live here anymore...

	SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of
	the roof.

				SPIDER-MAN
		And tell the Professor he can't have
		Peter's data. Goodbye.

	SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors
	straight down into heavy bushes below.

	INT. ELECTRODYNE FACTORY SHOP - DAY

	A SIGN tells us so. A CLERK is double checking a long
	list of items OCK has ordered.

	CLERK
	Holy cow, whattaya building, fella, a
	cyclotron?
			(Ock glares at him)
		Okay... lets see here. Page three. We
		got 30,000 feet of 50-gauge copper co-ax...
		twin 550 XK transformers... cadmium
		accelerator rails, a half dozen... a GBC
		relative multi-phase transducer... and
		one yellow thermos.
			(finishes computation)
		That'll be $475,989.65...

				OCK
		Wrap it up...

	CLERK
	What about the money... or do you pay by
	credit card?

				OCK
			(a long beat)
		Cash! I'll be back soon.

	EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE OF A BANK - BACK DOOR - NIGHT

	An ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the
	Bank's DOORS.

	Suddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW
	of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER'S NECK
	and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for
	his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out
	through his WINDOW.

	TWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR
	DOOR.

				BANK GUARD
		What's going on here?

	The WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The
	TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS.

				OCK
		Cash!

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY

	A PHOTO ASSISTANT look on as JAMESON goes over PETER'S
	latest PHOTOS. They are his SPIDER-MAN shots.

				PETER
		Doesn't he look amazing in that one?
		Look, he's flying in the air!

				JAMESON
		I don't care if he flies to the moon.
		He's just another wrestler in a silly
		costume. Look at this, Parker, right off
		the wire. This is the guy who hit that
		armored truck this morning. They say he
		has metal arms... get me a picture of
		this character!

				PETER
		Metal arms?

				JAMESON
		Four of them.

				PETER
		Ock...?!

				JAMESON
		The web faced weirdo... He is a joke in a
		Halloween costume... don't make me laugh.

	He tears up PETER'S SPIDEY PHOTOS.

				JAMESON
		Now get out of here and don't come back
		without something I can use!

				PETER
		Yes sir...
			(stops, and turns back)

				JAMESON
		A mega baloney... A bug in blue tights...
		what next?

				PETER
		The Journal said he was a mega-smash on
		MTV...

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	WEINER is putting on a CLOWN SUIT. He fastidiously puts
	his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a PIPE. The
	PIPE turns into a snake. It is, in fact, a WALDO!

				OCK
			(turning from work)
		What do you think you're doing?

				WEINER
		I'm going to the Masquerade. It's
		Halloween tonight Doc, aren't you coming
		to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go
		without an outfit.

	A WALDO whips around WEINER'S throat... AARRRGH!

				OCK
		You're not going to any ball, clown.
		You're going to get me Peter Parker's
		data...

				WEINER
		I was almost killed on my last try...
		Look at all these bruises...

				OCK
		I don't care if you come back dead. Just
		get it!

				WEINER
			(croaking)
		Cost you a thousand bucks, if I get it.

	The WALDO coils tighten around WEINER'S throat.

				WEINER
		All right... boss please let go...
		P L E A S E ...

				OCK
		Just get it, Weiner. I'm running out of
		time. If you fail me again, you won't
		have to concern yourself with money
		anymore... DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?!

	WEINER croaks his assent.

	INT. CAFETERIA - NIGHT

	It is all dressed up for a party: LIGHTS, STREAMERS,
	GLITTER BALL, the WORKS! HARRY is dressed as a SPACEMAN;
	PETER wears his regular clothes.

				HARRY
		You should have worn a costume. I told
		you to wear a costume.

				PETER
		It's... embarrassing.

				HARRY
		There's Liz...

	LIZ is crossing the dance floor dressed as an INDIAN
	PRINCESS in an MINI-DRESS.

				PETER
		Yeah...

	ROZ, dressed as a COWBOY, ambles over.

				ROZ
		... howdy partners.

				PETER/HARRY
		Hiya, Professor Rosomorf.

				HARRY
		Any word on Doctor Octavius?

				ROZ
			(falling in step)
		Nothing beyond what I read in the papers.
		I'm afraid he's not the same man we knew.
		You know, I've been digging through the
		notes on his experiments...

	PETER follows LIZ with his eyes. She takes a seat at a
	TABLE next to KIM who wears a HAREM GIRL outfit with the
	SALAMANDER around her neck. Next to KIM is... SPIDER-MAN!
	PETER'S eyes go wide.

				ROZ
		You boys must have had an extraordinary
		classroom experience.

				PETER
			(eyeing Spidey)
		Yes sir... oh... I'm going to be a little
		late with my paper on the Planetary
		Conjunction, sir...

				ROZ
		Whenever you're ready... I'll look at it.
		I know it's going to be an important
		work... and Peter, take my hat.

	He hands PETER an oversized TEN GALLON HAT.

				ROZ
		It is a costume party.

	PETER and HARRY make their way through the dance floor to
	the table. PETER can't take his eyes off SPIDEY.

				HARRY
		Look, there's Spider-Man!

				PETER
		Not the real one, I'm sure...

				HARRY
		You can never be sure... all kinds of
		crazy stuff can happen at a masquerade
		ball...

				PETER
		I bet I know who it is.

	As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying
	to read the BUGLE'S sports section by party light. KIM
	waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face.

				PETER
		Hiya, Liz...

	LIZ moves to Flash, who's dressed in the SPIDER-MAN
	costume.

				LIZ
		Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man
		costume?

				PETER
		It's a very clever outfit you've got
		there, Flash.

				FLASH
		Take a hike, asshole.

				LIZ
			(to Peter)
		How did you recognize him?

				PETER
		His pretty blue eyes give him away...

				HARRY
		Anyway, who'll be sitting with you at the
		Halloween Ball?

				LIZ
			(whispers to Flash)
		I wanna dance... Hey, Spider-Man... Shall
		we Flash dance?

				FLASH/SPIDER-MAN
		Hey, I'm reading the paper, okay?

	LIZ turns with a mild pout. Nervously, PETER ponders his
	chance. HARRY nudges him.

				HARRY
		Take her now, it's easy...

	HARRY turns to KIM and does a clanking shimmy in the SPACE
	SUIT.

				HARRY
		Wanna dance, Schechrezaa?

				KIM
		I'm pooped.

				LIZ
		I'm not...

	She reaches for HARRY'S hand.

				FLASH
		Holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at
		these pictures of Spider-Man? Wow! Is
		this guy great or what?

	LIZ looks. She shrugs. Then she shrieks.

				LIZ
		Hey, Peter! These are your pictures!

				FLASH
		Can't be...

				LIZ
		It says here "Photos by Peter Parker."

	PETER reacts, then looks over FLASH'S other shoulder.

	INSERT: There are three PHOTOS of SPIDER-MAN in the paper.
	PETER BLUSHES, smiling.

				FLASH
			(takes off his head mask)
		You know this guy, Parker?

				PETER
		Well, yeah... sort of...

				FLASH
		Wow... I'll give you anything if you
		introduce us.

				HARRY
			(to Liz)
		Will you grant me this dance...?

	LIZ joins him provocatively.

				KIM
		Hey, Flash-Man... Wanna dance...?

				FLASH
		Well, why not.

	PETER is left alone, PETER leaves toward the entrance.
	At the REAR DOOR a BIG LIZARD passes a NOTE to a DALLAS
	COWGIRL who passes it to a KANGAROO. The KANGAROO hops
	across the dance floor to the STAGE where he hands the
	NOTE to a YOUNG WOMAN in a BASEBALL UNIFORM.

	She climbs the STAGE where she is bathed in a SPOTLIGHT.
	She gets a DRUM ROLL from the band. There are some BOOS
	as the bad stops.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Thank you, thank you. We have a special
		surprise guest tonight.
			(booo)
		The Empire State University Masquerade
		Ball presents... The "Slammy" winning
		star of MTV'S wrestling tournament... The
		Amazing Spider-Man!

	FLASH, amazed turns to LIZ. He points to himself and
	mouths, "Me?" (The REAL) SPIDEY drops from the ceiling and
	lands in a pose. The CROWD cheers. He does a flip to LIZ
	and extends a hand. The BAND starts up. LIZ demurs.

				FLASH
			(whispers firmly)
		Go ahead... go ahead!

	LIZ takes SPIDEY'S hand and they move slowly and sexily
	onto the dance floor. They do a short simple number.
	SPIDEY returns LIZ to FLASH.

				LIZ
			(to Flash)
		Come on... Flash...

	FLASH takes LIZ from PETER (SPIDER-MAN).

	LIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers.
	The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd
	backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number
	in film history. He's all over the floor and on the walls
	and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ
	and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops
	in a pose. BIG CHEERS.

	LIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN'S face.

				LIZ
			(whispers breathless)
		Who are you...?

				PETER
		One day you'll know...

				LIZ
			(a long beat)
		You sound very familiar.

				PETER/SPIDER-MAN
		Sure I do... I'm your friendly
		neighborhood Spider-Man!

	He jumps away and disappears, leaving the CROWD aghast and
	LIZ in love.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN is flicking through the channels of his TV, aggravated
	as usual. It's all ROCK VIDEOS!

				BEN
			(to May)
		What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and
		roll's screwed up the whole TV.

	He flicks off the set and turns to MAY who's asleep on the
	couch. He gently nudges her.

				BEN
		Come on, May. Wake up and go to sleep.

	EXT. TAXI - NIGHT

	It enters the EAST RIVER DRIVE.

	INT. TAXI - NIGHT

	As the city rolls by.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(fearful)
		Hey! Can't you go any faster?

				CABBIE
		What'm I in, a race?

				SPIDER-MAN
			(fighting his fear)
		I don't know... I get this tingling in my
		brain, like some danger is lurking just
		ahead. I'm worried about Aunt May and
		Uncle Ben...

				CABBIE
		Your family?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Well, they are kind of my parents. They
		raised me. I lost both of my parents in
		a car accident... please step on it!

				CABBIE
		Step on it... so now you want to kill
		yourself in another accident... not with
		me, Boychick.

				SPIDER-MAN
		But I'm telling you... I've got this--

				CABBIE
		... tingling... I know. And I got
		ulcers... Everybody's got something to
		worry about.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Please... Faster... Please.

				CABBIE
		Okay, you asked for it.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The TAXI skids and swerves like crazy, bumping into
	everything in sight.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A GLASS SHATTERS. AUNT MAY sits up in bed with a start.

				AUNT MAY
		What's that?

				BEN
		What? It's nothing... go back to sleep...
			(another crash)
		Oh, I'll go look. Go back to sleep.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	WEINER is going through the drawers. He finds a nice BONE
	HANDLE KNIFE and pockets it.

				WEINER
		Hmmm...

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN descends the stairs from the bedroom. He peers off
	into the darkness and pulls his ROBE tight around him as
	if to ward off some unacknowledged danger.

	EXT. TAXI - NIGHT

	TAXI driving fast through STREET.

	INT. TAXI - NIGHT

				CABBIE
		Some crazy kinda town, huh? You hear
		about that hold-up? The guy with the six
		arms? Hey, I see it all on this job.
			(a beat)
		What kinda outfit is that, anyway?

				SPIDER-MAN
			(panicked)
		Look, I'm really in a hurry.

	BANG! A BLOW OUT. The CABBIE fights the wheel to the
	side of the road. Then he turns to SPIDEY.

				CABBIE
			(sly)
		You said the magic words, we have a flat
		Boychick.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN comes in and looks around. A long beat. Then a
	noise.

				BEN
		Mice...

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	A very scared WEINER hides, eyes widening. WEINER takes
	the BONE HANDLE KNIFE from his pocket. It glints in the
	MOONLIGHT. He moves off.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	BEN is looking for mice. He opens a closet. Nothing. He
	shifts around. Nothing. He moves off.

	EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT

	The CABBIE slowly changes the TIRE. Fearing the worst,
	SPIDEY gets out, looking for a ride. A TRUCK approaches.
	SPIDEY looks down at the CABBIE and then up at the TRUCK.

				CABBIE
		Hey! You wanna hand me that lug wrench?

	He looks up to see SPIDEY go by, stuck to the side of the
	TRUCK like a spider.

				CABBIE
		Some crazy kinda town...

	EXT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT

	SPIDEY stares at the lettering on the side of the TRUCK.
	It says, "Victory Sporting Goods."

				SPIDER-MAN
			(a thought)
		Sporting goods...

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN comes in quietly. He looks around. He opens a
	closet. Nothing. He hears a CRASH. He wheels. A
	SHADOWY FIGURE runs by a doorway!
	BEN takes off like a shot!

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	BEN runs through the rooms.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN flies in and goes right to the RIFLE on the wall. WE
	hear WEINER clattering around the house in the background
	as BEN goes to a drawer and pulls out a BOX of BULLETS.
	He begins to fight the BULLETS into the RIFLE.
	WEINER comes flying in and tackles him. They fall to the
	floor, four hands on the RIFLE. They scuffle.

				WEINER
		All I want it the kid's computer crap!

				BEN
		Let go before I blow your brain's out.

	EXT. FOREST HILLS STREET - NIGHT

	The TRUCK pulls away leaving PETER in a POOL of STREET
	LAMP LIGHT. He's wearing a FOOTBALL JERSEY and SHORTS and
	carrying a SPORTS BAG. He begins to run.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MAY hears a CRASH. She pulls the covers up around her
	chin in fear.

				BEN (V.O.)
		Let go!

				WEINER (V.O.)
		You let go!

	EXT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	PETER runs up and hears a SHOT. He runs inside.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	PETER runs in. He sees WEINER standing there with the
	RIFLE. They face off across the room. The moment hits
	PETER like a punch in the chest.

				PETER
		Uncle Ben!

				BEN
			(a wheeze)
		Peter...

	PETER rushes to BEN.

				PETER
		Oh my God... Uncle Ben...

	PETER tries to revive BEN, while WEINER runs out.

	INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

	PLASTIC FURNITURE, GARISH LIGHTING, CIGARETTES in the
	ASHTRAYS.

				AUNT MAY
			(a brave but fragile front)
		Ben gets through everything. He'll be
		alright. The doctors are...

	AUNT MAY and PETER embrace, leaning on each other for
	support.

				DETECTIVE
			(compassionate)
		Excuse me. You the nephew?

	PETER rises, nods. As AUNT MAY wipes away a sniffle...

				DETECTIVE
		Your uncle's a brave man. Apparently,
		the perpetrator was after something of
		yours. Your uncle didn't know what it
		was but he stood up to him anyway. You
		ought to be proud of him.

				PETER
		I am... how is he...

	A grim-faced DOCTOR walks slowly across the room to
	them... MAY stands up slowly.

				DETECTIVE
		Ask the Doctor.

				AUNT MAY
		How's my... how's my husband doing...?

				DOCTOR
		Mrs. Parker, I'm sorry. We tried.

	MAY collapses.

				DOCTOR
		Crash cart! STAT!

	The Detective pulls PETER gently away. The STAFF works on
	MAY.

				DETECTIVE
		Let the medics handle it.
			(pause)
		Look, if it makes you feel any better.
		We're gonna nail this guy. He crashed
		his getaway car. We got him trapped in a
		warehouse on Jackson.

				NURSE
			(to Peter)
		She's alright. She just fainted. We'll
		have to check her for symptoms of shock.
		If you want to wait, you can get some
		coffee on the third floor.

				PETER
		No, I... I think I wanna go out for some
		fresh air.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	COP CARS, COPS, SEARCHLIGHTS playing their BEAMS against
	the ACME CHEMICAL STORAGE BUILDING. GUNFIRE flashes from
	one of the WINDOWS.

	EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT

	ELITE COPS in BASEBALL CAPS are plotting strategy.

				COP #1
		That place is loaded with solvents and
		chemicals. If we blast our way in, it's
		gonna go up like a roman candle.

				COP #2
		We could go in through the fifth floor
		wash room.

				COP #1
		What's that up there? Throw a light on
		that!

	COP #1 directs the BEAM of the SEARCHLIGHT.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN is climbing it, trapped in the GLARE of the
	SEARCHLIGHT. He freezes.

				COP #1
		He's got a partner!

	EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT

	Every COP'S WEAPON is trained upward at SPIDER-MAN!

				COP #2
			(on radio)
		We got an accomplice up there! And we
		got a clear shot. Do we have a go?

				RADIO
			(filtered)
		That's a go.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT

	GUNSHOTS erupt around SPIDER-MAN and he skitters around to
	evade them.

	INT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Thinking they're shooting at him, WEINER shoots back. In
	the corner of his eye he sees SPIDER-MAN at a side WINDOW.
	He aims his rifle and SPIDEY ducks out of the way.
	The frightened WEINER moves to the side WINDOW to blow
	SPIDEY away. As he moves past the front WINDOWS he is lit
	by the SEARCHLIGHTS that play on his face darkly.
	SPIDEY leaps in at FRONT WINDOW and drops neatly behind
	WEINER, landing a pose.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(cold, hard)
		Say your prayers, Weiner!

	WEINER whips around and fires. SPIDEY leaps to avoid it
	and lands on a STACK of PAINT CANS.

				WEINER
		You ain't takin' me... Spider-Man... who
		ever you are...

	SPIDEY gathers himself tighter. He leaps. A second GUN
	BURST comes in behind him, Several PAINT CANS erupt in
	cascades of COLOR.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(hanging on ceiling)
		Hey, creep!

	WEINER aims and fires, several times. He is emptying his
	RIFLE. SPIDEY leaps away and lands on the top of a CASK
	marked "CAUTION-FLAMMABLE SOLVENT!"

				SPIDER-MAN
			(taunting)
		Try again.

	The CASK gives way and SPIDEY is plunged into the
	FLAMMABLE SOLVENT. WEINER smiles his stupid grin and
	takes aim.

	SPIDEY leaps out of the CASK and sticks to the roof BEAM.
	He's sopping wet. His hand slips down the BEAM as the
	SOLVENT works against his sticking power.

	He falls to the floor and scrambles behind some PAINT
	CANS. WEINER, crazed, fires wildly. One of the CANS
	EXPLODES. PAINT flows from it... burning!

	SPIDEY peeks out and sees a YELLOW RIVER OF FLAME creeping
	toward him. He sniffs his SOLVENT soaked outfit.

	He backs down a "corridor" of PAINT CANS. The YELLOW FIRE
	follows, now joined by a RIVER OF BLUE FIRE from another
	can. They're following the trail of SOLVENT he's
	dripping!

	He's trapped!

				COP (V.O.)
			(on bullhorn)
		This is your last chance, you two.
		Either you're coming out, or we're coming
		in!

	SPIDEY'S against the WALL! PAINT CANS to his right and
	left, and a RIVER of RED FLAME joins the YELLOW and BLUE
	as they creep toward him!

	He climbs backwards up the wall, face toward the BLAZE.
	The COLORED FIRES join and follow him up the wall!
	They're licking at his feet!

				WEINER
			(at the window)
		Stay back!
			(gun burst)
		Whoa... stay back down there!

	SPIDEY is inches from being torched. He sees a PIPE. He
	reaches out and grabs it. He swings out above the flames.
	But the PIPE begins to bend!

	The PIPE bends down... down... and then breaks! SPIDEY
	hangs precariously as WATER cascades out of the PIPE and
	puts out the FIRE.

	SPIDEY drops down and rest his head in his hands to
	collect himself. Then looks up. The GUN is at his head.

				WEINER
		Stand up, you.

	SPIDEY stands.

				COP (V.O.)
		You have thirty seconds to come out!

				WEINER
		You're my ticket outa here. Gimme that
		stupid mask!

	SPIDER-MAN hesitates. Then he begins to raise the MASK,
	but stops and shakes his head no.

				WEINER
		Then I'll take it myself.

	He reaches for the mask and SPIDER-MAN flips him across
	the room. WEINER lands in a CARGO net and becomes
	ensnared.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Well, look what we've caught in our web...

				WEINER
		Don't hurt me, man. Please don't hurt me...

	INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	COPS are poised at the door. A signal. They crash
	inside.

	INT. WAREHOUSE PAINT ROOM - NIGHT

				COP #1
		Hold your fire!

	WEINER is hanging from the ceiling in the the CARGO NET.
				WEINER
		Get me out of this madhouse!

	He falls down, immediately encircled by the POLICE
	OFFICERS. SPIDER-MAN flies above their heads, crashing
	through the WINDOW and disappears into the dark of night.

	INT. CYCLOTRON - NIGHT

	A weird, flickering BLUE LIGHT dances around the hole in
	the CYCLOTRON. Then it cuts out. A HELMETED MAN pulls
	himself out of a HATCH. He flips up the HELMET.
	OCK is finishing putting together his new equipment.

				OCK
			(smiling)
		Okey, dokey.

	OCK goes about checking out the CYCLOTRON. It looks good.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK starts flicking switches and reading DIALS, doing a
	"mission countdown" for his next experiment. This place
	has been "hot rodded" to the max.

				OCK
			(reading dials and numbers)
		Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative
		variable differential... good enough.

	He shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down.

				OCK
		Okey, dokey... now all I need is Parker's
		data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it...
		I can't trust anybody.
			(throws his Waldo in the air)
		Only you, my babies... only you can I
		trust... Okay... If I have to do
		everything myself... I'm going to do it.
			(to his equipment)
		I'll be back... my babies... my new
		babies!

	OCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	There is more EQUIPMENT than before. PETER is deep at
	work. His SPIDER-MAN UNIFORM hangs on the WALL. There is
	a knock at the DOOR.

				LIZ (V.O.)
		Hey, Peter! Are you finished with my
		computer yet? I got a paper too, you
		know...

				PETER
			(panicked)
		Oh my God... oh, it's you, Liz... I
		didn't expect you... uh... give me a
		minute.

	He hides his SPIDER-MAN COSTUME.

	INT. THE HALLWAY LANDING - NIGHT

	LIZ waits impatiently.

				PETER
			(opening the door)
		Hi, Liz. Come on in.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	LIZ enters, looking around. PETER covers for this and
	that.

				LIZ
		What were you doing in here?

				PETER
			(looking around)
		Cleaning up. Come on. I'll get your
		computer. Where's Flash parked?

	He picks up the COMPUTER and turns to her, but she's
	already looking around the apartment.

				LIZ
		Flash didn't come.

				PETER
			(holding it)
		Oh. Well... how are you going to get it
		home?

	LIZ walks into the room.

				LIZ
		Taxi... I guess.

	She discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up
	around the apartment.

				LIZ
		You must spend a lot of time with this
		Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don't you think
		you ought to unplug that!

	PETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall.
	Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down.

				PETER
			(embarrassed)
		I, uh, I'll go down to the corner... see
		it I can hail that taxi.

	PETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he
	so...?

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A SHADOW of a MAN can be seen hiding. PETER does not
	notice him.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	There's a KNOCK at the DOOR.

				LIZ
			(crossing to it, wondering)
		Peter...?

	She is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash
	through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered
	doorway, WALDOS writhing.

				LIZ
		Doctor Octavius...! You're... You're...
			(finds the words)
		You're so weird!... with those... what do
		you call those...

				OCK
		Waldos... Did you hear about Spider-Man?
			(moving Waldos like spider's legs)
		That's me... the real Spider-Man... now
		tell me, where is that jerky friend of
		yours... Parker?

				LIZ
			(protecting)
		Peter?... oh... he's not here. He's gone.
		I don't think he'll be back for awhile.

				OCK
			(running his Waldo in her hair)
		You wouldn't lie to your Professor now,
		would you?

				LIZ
		Of course not. Why would I lie about a
		thing like that? Really. He's... out.

				OCK
		We'll wait.
		OCK grabs LIZ'S HAIR with his WALDOS.

				LIZ
		What are you doing... let me go! Please...
		take those things out of my hair!

				OCK
		My Waldos, you mean.

				LIZ
		Whatever you call them... please...

	OCK shoots out TWO WALDOS. Simultaneously each grabs a
	CHAIR from different parts of the room and brings them to
	the TABLE.

				OCK
		Sit.

	She does. He does, too, and folds his WALDOS across his
	chest.

				OCK
			(chatty)
		He's a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe,
		but nice, wouldn't you say?

				LIZ
		Oh, I don't know. Maybe. He's very
		inexperienced.

	ONE of OCK'S WALDOS rests on the TABLE curled around the
	COMPUTER. LIZ lets her hand rest on it. OCK warms
	immediately.

				OCK
		You know, you're a fascinating young lady...

				LIZ
		Thank you...

				OCK
		You're so refreshing. You're so...

				LIZ
		Shocking...?

				OCK
			(gone to far)
		Oh, I wouldn't say shocking...

				LIZ
		I would!

	She sticks his WALDO in the ELECTRIC WALL SOCKET behind
	the COMPUTER! The CURRENT sizzles through him and he
	leaps up, WALDOS akimbo, like the "cartoon cat." LIZ runs
	out the door.

	OCK extricates himself from the current and gives chase.

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ burst from the DOOR.

				LIZ
		Peter...!

	She looks both ways for PETER, doesn't see him, and takes
	off! OCK bursts from the doorway and runs off after LIZ.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	LIZ running as fast as she can, but OCK is gaining
	quickly.

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A TAXI drives up and disgorges PETER.

				PETER
		Wait here...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	He walks in. It's empty

				PETER
		Liz?

				LIZ (V.O.)
			(screaming from the street)
		Peter! Help! Peter!

	PETER springs into action. He grabs his SPIDEY SUIT out
	of a drawer and starts taking off his clothes.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	LIZ looks back and sees OCK CARTWHEELING toward her. She
	can't outrun him. She must hide. There's a CONSTRUCTION
	SITE on the right. She ducks down the alley next to it.

	INT. CONSTRUCTION ALLEY - NIGHT

	LIZ runs into it and finds herself trapped on three sides
	by a high CYCLONE FENCE. Behind her, OCK'S WALDOS stretch
	out like waterbug legs. He bug-walks into the alley and
	laughs down at her from his perch atop the WALDOS.

				OCK
		Peter Parker has something I want... And
		I'm going to have something he wants.

	She dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO
	ELEVATOR.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	She looks for the UP BUTTON and finds nothing! OCK, on
	his feet now, is on the wire mesh ELEVATOR CAGE in a
	flash. He tears the outer DOOR away.

	LIZ starts pressing KNOBS and LEVERS in panic. The LIGHT
	goes on. A WARNING BELL clangs. She finally finds the
	switch and the CAR leaps up just as OCK tears off its
	front door.

	LIZ, safe for the moment, watches OCK recede below,
	shaking the torn off door in a rage.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

	Extending WALDO over WALDO, OCK climbs the ELEVATOR
	HOUSING chasing the rising CAR inside.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION ROOF - NIGHT

	The CAR arrives and LIZ jumps out. She's on nothing but a
	narrow GIRDER! She tightropes on the GIRDER. OCK gets to
	the top. He looks across at her. She's stuck between two
	unfastened GIRDERS, at a dead end. He slowly telescopes a
	WALDO toward her. She's got no place to run, no place to
	hide. He grabs her by the BLOUSE and lifts her off the
	GIRDER.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
		Put her down, Ock.

	OCK looks across the street. There, on the top of a tall
	building, is SPIDER-MAN.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I know what's happening to you, Ock.
		I've been through a lot of changes myself
		lately. You have to listen to me.

				OCK
			(holding Liz)
		Who the hell are you?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Spider-Man.

				LIZ
			(seeing Spidey)
		Spider-Man...

				OCK
		That's a lot of crap, clown... I am
		Spider-Man, not you.
			(points to Liz)
		Ask you girlfriend.
			(to Liz)
		Tell him!

				SPIDER-MAN
		I'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock.
		Just like that girl you're holding. Now
		let her go.

	OCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the
	kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories
	up.

				OCK
		Let her go? What an excellent idea. If
		you do not deliver your friend, Mr.
		Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll
		let her go.

				LIZ
		Put me down, you mechanical mutant!

	LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She
	twists. She flails around, making things a little worse.
	The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP!
	PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets!
	SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his
	characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the
	falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short.

				LIZ
			(falling away)
		You jerk!

	He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to
	a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound.

				LIZ
			(straightening herself)
		Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get
		the taxi myself...

				OCK
			(screams)
		Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man...
		Prepare to meet your death, bug.

	SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(whispers)
		Actually, I'm rather fond of living...
		especially now...
			(he looks at Liz)

	He lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the
	cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above
	the street.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(a last appeal to reason)
		Octavius. Just stop and think.

				OCK
		I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking
		about exterminating you!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, if that's the way you want it...
		Let's see what those chrome knuckles can
		do, Doc...

	A WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw.
	It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and
	rolls over. He rubs his jaw.

				LIZ
		Great...

	SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by
	another barrage of blows from above.

				OCK
		Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown.

	OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY
	off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on.
	But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and
	swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER-
	ADVERSARIES engage in battle.

	With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and
	SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY,
	they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the
	CONSTRUCTION SITE.

				OCK
		Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one
		will be able to stop me.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Stop you from what...?

				OCK
		My destiny!

	OCK throws his biggest punch yet.

	SIRENS can now be heard in the street.

	SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes
	WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning
	circles.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Over here, Octopus!

				OCK
		That's Professor Octopus to you Spider
		Jerk!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Give it up, Professor. You'll never
		catch me!

	OCK takes three steps and soars through the air.

	EXT. BRICK WALL - NIGHT

	OCK, misjudging the leap, soars right past SPIDEY and into
	an alley! Screaming all the way...

	EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT

	OCK and TWO WALDOS pressed against each of the opposing
	walls. It's a tenuous grip. Then, very slowly, sparks
	flying from his WALDOS, OCK slides down into the alley.

				SPIDER-MAN
		So long, sucker.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	COP CARS pull up. COPS leap from them.

	EXT. SIDE WALL - NIGHT

	OCK makes it down, sees the COPS, ducks out of sight.

	EXT. COP CARS - NIGHT

	The SEARCHLIGHTS go on. SPIDER-MAN swings back across the
	street to the CONSTRUCTION SITE.

				COP #1
		There he is!

				COP #2
		It's that Spider-Man!

	EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

	SPIDEY lands next to LIZ in a pose. Lit by the flashing
	BILLBOARD, he's weirder looking than ever. SPIDEY puts an
	arm around LIZ and extends a WEB SHOOTER.

				LIZ
		What do you think you're doing?

				SPIDER-MAN
		I'm rescuing you.

	With that SPIDEY leaps way out and he and LIZ swoop away
	on a WEB-STRAND.

				LIZ
		Thanks but nooooooooooo!

	EXT. THE COP CARS - NIGHT

	ALL WEAPONS point upward at SPIDEY'S movement.

				COP #2
		He won't get away this time!

				COP #1
		Hold your fire! He's got a girl.

				COP #2
		Looks like he's got a hostage.

	EXT. WEB STRAND - NIGHT

	SPIDEY sees the WEAPONS aimed upward. He shoots out
	another WEB and swings off in a different direction. LIZ
	whoops with the G-force.

				LIZ
		Wait a minute. Where are you taking me?
		SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I better just take you back where you
		belong.

	He shoots out another WEB.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hold on tight.

				LIZ
			(Times Square)
		Where are we?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Open your eyes.

	They are standing on the ROOF of the CENTRAL TOWER of the
	EMPIRE UNIVERSITY BUILDING. LIZ opens her eyes. It's an
	extraordinary sight.

				LIZ
			(the Empire State Building)
		If you're trying to impress me Spidey, I
		want you to know I'm not easy. Okay, I'm
		impressed... now put me down, Spidey...
		put me down.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I like the way you say Spidey... Nobody
		calls me Spidey... now we go...

	EXT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

	They swoop down... and down... stopping on one of the
	building's SILLS, actually right in front of a WINDOW in
	the DORMITORY BUILDING.

				LIZ
			(Tavern on the Green)
		Wow... look, this is our dormitory. I
		can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute...
		there's Flash, if I'm not mistaken.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Liz?

				LIZ
		You know my name?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Liz, listen to me. There's something I
		have to tell you.

				LIZ
		Okay, put me down and we can talk,
		alright?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Do you know who I am?

				LIZ
		All I know is you're the Amazing
		Spider-Man... or better you're Spidey the
		good guy on the block... you're a weirdo
		in a clown spider suit.

				SPIDER-MAN
		And that's all you know about me?
			(a beat, a sigh)
		Okay, lets get your boyfriend.

				LIZ
		Which one?

				SPIDER-MAN
		How many do you have? I meant Flash.

				LIZ
		Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend...

				SPIDER-MAN
		He's not? Then who is?

				LIZ
		There's someone I like, but he's too shy
		to notice.
			(Flash appears)

				SPIDER-MAN
		Flash!

				FLASH
		Liz!
			(a beat)
		SPIDER-MAN!!!

				LIZ
			(to Spider-Man)
		You know everybody... Flash we have to
		call Peter!

	FLASH rushes right past LIZ to the WINDOW. There's a
	NEWSPAPER in his hand.

				FLASH
		Hey, they won't let up, man!
			(shows Daily Bugle)
		They keep calling you an accomplice in
		that burglary murder. But that's a crock,
		ain't it? I'm with you, Spidey, 100%

				SPIDER-MAN
		Thanks.

				FLASH
			(realizing)
		By the way, what are you doing with...
		Liz?

				SPIDER-MAN
		She needed a lift.

				FLASH
		Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A
		lot of beer!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Thanks, but I have some business to take
		care of.

				FLASH
		Well... take care of that later. Wait
		here. I'll get the beer.

	He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW
	where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES.

				LIZ
			(accusatory)
		How'd you know this was Flash's place?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Peter Parker told me all about it.

				LIZ
		Peter told you all about Flash?

				SPIDER-MAN
		No... he told me all about you. See you
		later.
			(he jumps away)

	INT. DORM - NIGHT

	FLASH comes in with more BEER than a man ought to carry.

				FLASH
		Hey, where'd he go? Hey, Spider-Man!!

	But SPIDER-MAN has disappeared.

				LIZ
			(distracted)
		Peter told your Hero all about me...

				FLASH
		He would, wouldn't he... that jerk!

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOF - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	He drops into the room and pulls off his MASK. The place
	has been ransacked. COMPUTER DISCS are all over the
	floor. PETER pulls a file marked "Planetary Conjunction."
	He opens it.

	A piece of PAPER falls out. It says, "Kiss it goodbye,
	Wall Crawler!"

				PETER
			(whispers angrily)
		Octavius!!!

	EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY

	PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself
	wonderfully.

				PETER
			(hurrying by)
		Kim! Have you seen Harry?

				KIM
		Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac...

				PETER
		Yeah... have you seen him today?

				KIM
		No, un unh.

				LIZ
			(catching up)
		Peter...!

				PETER
			(keeps walking)
		Hi... have you seen Harry?

				LIZ
		No. What a night, huh?

				PETER
			(laughs)
		Yeah, that was some ride home... must
		have been pretty exciting.

				LIZ
		It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets
		to Les Miserables... wanna go?

				PETER
		Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not
		tonight... see you later.

				LIZ
			(thinking)
		Hey, Peter... how did you know about last
		night...?

				PETER
		What about last night?

				LIZ
		My exciting ride with Spider-Man...

				PETER
		Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to
		find Harry... I'll see you later.

				LIZ
		Peter!

	PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it.

				PETER
		Hey! Can I get a lift downtown?

				FLASH
		Take your shoes for a walk, Dork.

	FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward
	LIZ.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	OCK is hard at work. The room, still rippled, has been
	"hot rodded" to the max. Lots of jerry-rigged stuff has
	been added.

	OCK takes a sip from the THERMOS and flicks on the small
	TAPE RECORDER.

				OCK
		We are new inserting Peter Parker's data
		on tonight's Planetary Conjunction.

	INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays Peter Parker's name
	and ID number and the title, "The Planetary Conjunction
	and it's effect on Earth Gravity."

				OCK
		Yes, yes! Go on! Go on!

	INSERT: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then a
	GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN,
	JUPITER, the SUN and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER
	rises.

				OCK
		Enormous. It's enormous.
			(to recorder)
		The Parker calculations add 4%
		gravitational force at the moment of full
		Planetary Conjunction.
			(hits some keys)
		Adding this to present maximum power
		potential, I get...

	He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC "HOLE" opening
	up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is
	swallowing everything!

				OCK
		I knew it. I knew it! Universal
		destruction! It's doable! I am putting
		a countdown clock on the Planetary
		Conjunction now!

	A LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY reads, "13:00:03." The last
	seconds count down to, "12:59:59!"

				OCK
			(playing the computer)
		Okey, dokey. Now let's see if I have
		enough power to drive this beast.

	He starts hitting KEYS on his COMPUTER.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	PETER is working on LIZ'S COMPUTER. There is a KNOCK at
	his brand new, unpainted DOOR. He hurries to it and pulls
	the KNOB so quickly (forgetting his own strength) that the
	whole assembly comes off in his hand.

				PETER
			(pulling Harry aside)
		I gotta remember to have that fixed.
			(opens the door)
		There you are, I've been looking for you
		all over town.

				HARRY
		What happened?

				PETER
		Where were you?

				HARRY
		I went to the wrestling, wanted to see
		that Amazing Spider-Man, but he didn't
		show up.

				PETER
		Listen, Harry something terrible happened.

				HARRY
		What? What?

				PETER
		My Planetary Conjunction papers... they
		were stolen...

				HARRY
		Oh my God... Are you sure...? Who would
		do such a thing?

				PETER
		Ock...

				HARRY
		Of course... but why...?

				PETER
		We have to find out, sit down.
			(indicates computer)
		I want to access Dr. Octavius' main
		program. I want to know about his
		experiments with the cyclotron. Can you
		do it?

				HARRY
			(starts hacking)
		I can try. I could access the system in
		the dorm. Okay. And through that I
		could crack the main line.

				PETER
		Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the
		Octavius file...

				HARRY
		Okay, let's try.

	HARRY cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to
	the task. The PHONE RINGS. PETER hits his jerry-rigged
	SPEAKER PHONE. HARRY keeps hacking.

				PETER
		Yeah?

				JAMESON (V.O.)
		Parker? Peter Parker? This is J. Jonah
		Jameson!

				PETER
			(looking over Harry's shoulder)
		Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time.

				JAMESON (V.O.)
		I need pictures of your friend, the
		Amazing Spider-Man. But I need bad guy
		shots, you got it? Lots of bad guy shots.
		We're gonna pin that insect to the wall.
		Whaddaya say?

	PETER hangs up. The DIAL TONE cuts off JAMESON.

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Only he and the PHOTO ASSISTANT are there.

				JAMESON
		What about that kid? On the job already?

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK is pacing around the hot rodded room. He checks this
	and that. He looks at the COUNTDOWN CLOCK (06:00:10) and
	throws himself down in his CHAIR. He resumes his check-
	down.

				OCK
		Fusion cells...? All up. Internal
		temperature... okay. Risk?
			(a long beat)
		Acceptable.
			(another beat)
		Let's fly.

	He starts flicking on SWITCHES and DIALS. The WHINE whirs
	up. He throws the RED POWER THROTTLE. The POWER DIAL
	goes to 90!

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	PETER and HARRY are at a COMPUTER. The LIGHTS flicker and
	dim. Then they go back on. PETER and HARRY look at each
	other and shrug.

				HARRY
		Got something!

	INSERT: DIGITAL CLOCK display: "06:00:03"

				PETER
		What is it?

				HARRY
		Let me see. It's some kind of countdown
		clock.

				PETER
		Countdown to what?

				HARRY
		I don't know, but whatever it is, it's
		only six hours away.

				PETER
		The Planetary Conjunction?

				HARRY
		Could be...

				PETER
		Or Doc Ock's end of the world experiment...
		Or both!

				HARRY
		Wait a minute. You're not telling me you
		think the world is gonna end tonight...?

				PETER
		You want to wait around till midnight to
		find out?

				HARRY
		No, but...

				PETER
		Let's see what else we've got.

	Another set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are
	accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS.

				HARRY
		What's that?

				PETER
		It might be a calculation of the amount
		of power he needs to create the hole
		between the force and the anti-force.

				HARRY
		That's a lot of energy. What could
		generate power like that?

				PETER
		The closest you could come is the New
		York City Subway System.

	Again, the lights flicker and then dim and they return.

	HARRY/PETER
			(together)
		We gotta talk to Professor Rosomorf!!

	INT. BROADWAY EXPRESS - NIGHT

	ROZ boards and takes a seat. There are the usual SUBWAY
	TYPES. A FAT WOMAN. A PIMPLY TEENAGER and his date, a
	TALL SKINNY GIRL in a PARTY DRESS.

	ROZ, making notations in a PAD, takes no notice of them.
	He sits down, closes his PAD, and taps a PENCIL against
	his chin.

				ROZ
		Plutonium...

	EXT. MAJOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT

	TAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar
	WHINE. The "WALK" and "DON'T WALK" signs FLASH at the
	same time.

	BOY
	Make up your mind!

	The signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The
	BOY looks at the GIRL.

				GIRL
		What's going on?

	An ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS
	of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner.

	INT. BROADWAY LOCAL - NIGHT

	SPARKS fly by the window. ROZ, oblivious at first, is now
	stunned by the show.

	EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY continue to rise. The STREET
	LIGHTS buckle and bend into weird shapes.

				WOMAN
		Oh my God!

				MAN
		Get back! Get back!

	EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

	TWO TAXIS roar through the intersection and COLLIDE. The
	ETHNIC DRIVERS leap out and begin arguing.

	INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	PEOPLE SCREAM and fall back as the TRAIN seems to change
	angles.

	EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	A building ROAR rises from the SUBWAY ENTRANCE. Then the
	sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE! The BOY looks down the STAIRS
	and has to leap out of the way as the BROADWAY EXPRESS
	comes highballing up the STEPS and blasts through the
	SUBWAY entrance.

	The TRAIN sails through the air.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	The TRAIN crashes into the building in a storm of
	cyclotron generated Dali physics.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The THROB and PULSE recede. SCREAMS, HONKS, SIRENS can be
	heard.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	A splendidly turned out MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN wakes from her
	satin sleep to see that a SUBWAY TRAIN is in the middle of
	her BEDROOM. The WALL through which the train has come
	sags and ripples like it has melted and partially
	resolidified.

				WOMAN
		Henry!!!

	Several PASSENGERS climb out of the WINDOWS of the TRAIN
	or pry open the DOORS.

				WOMAN
		What are you doing here? Get out of here!
		Get out of here!

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	A CROWD has gathered to gawk and point. They look up and
	we see their POV.

	The MIDDLE CAR of the TRAIN is simply "embedded" in the
	HIGH-RISE, its rear sticking out of the building fifteen
	stories up. From its COUPLING dangles the LAST CAR.

	INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT

	The car is bisected in the middle by the fused brick and
	glass of the WALL of the building. PASSENGERS on the
	outside of the WALL press their faces to the GLASS and
	pound for help.

	ROZ comes to the aid of a MOTHER with TWO CHILDREN.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The CROWD sees something else. Swinging high in the sky
	is your friendly neighborhood SPIDER-MAN. The COUPLE and
	TWO DRIVERS argue about what this means.

				WOMAN
		It's Spider-Man!

				TRUCK DRIVER #1
		Get outa here, you bum!

				WOMAN
		Hey, what are you talking about?!

				TRUCK DRIVER #2
			(back at woman)
		What's the matter, lady don't you read
		the papers?

	This is the DRIVER of a DAILY BUGLE truck carrying the
	historically famous Bugle headline, "Spider-Man - Threat
	or Menace?"

				MAN
		Go Spidey! Go!

	INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT

	It's nearly vertical! People are tumbled over each other.
	The scared TEENAGER is tearing at the door. The SKINNY
	GIRL screams in a mechanical way. The DOOR opens. He
	nearly falls!

	The SKINNY GIRL screams again. He manages to get back
	inside. She looks at him, safe now. But she screams
	again anyway.

	ROZ struggles to right himself against a pole. A BAG OF
	GROCERIES goes sliding past him. It continues downward
	and out the OPEN DOOR.

	INSERT: The BAG tumbles down through the air. Down, down,
	and down...

	INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY'S face appears in the WINDOW upside down.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hello, everybody...

	He slides the WINDOW down and flips inside. He walks
	through the parting PASSENGERS to the BUILDING WALL. He
	feels it.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, everyone, stand back and stay cool.

	He hurls himself at the fused GLASS portion and bounces
	back onto the floor. He rolls over, flexing his shoulder.

				WOMAN
			(whining)
		Is that the real Spider-Man?

	SPIDEY does a TRIPLE FLIP to his feet. He reaches up for
	the overhead RAILING and pulls it down easily. Oohs and
	aahs. SPIDER-MAN points it at the GLASS and hefts it.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Somebody wanna give me a hand with this?

	First the WOMAN, and then all of them, take up positions
	on the BATTERING RAM.

				SPIDER-MAN
		On three. One... Two... Three!

	They ram the GLASS and it shatters.

	INT. THE LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	HENRY stands at the open DOOR of the TRAIN in his bedroom
	as they all come rushing through into the room.

	HENRY
	Come on. Come on. That's it. Step
	lively now.

	WIFE
	Henry, the rugs!

	HENRY
	Oh, shut up!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Have a nice evening, Ma'am... and you
		too, Henry.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The FIRE TRUCKS arrive and begin assembling a LADDER.

	INT. THE LAST CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY arrives at the DOOR at the top of the CAR. He sees
	ROZ at the bottom. THREE PEOPLE are between them. The
	SKINNY GIRL sees SPIDEY. She screams.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, folks, just hang on...

	He scampers down the GRAB-HANDLES to the people below.
	FOUR PASSENGERS cling to SEATS and BARS.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, one at a time. You first, Ma'am...

	A FAT WOMAN makes a "who me?" gesture. SPIDEY throws her
	over his shoulder.

	INSERT: THE COUPLING which holds the two CARS at right
	angles begins to bend open.

	SPIDER-MAN, the FAT WOMAN over his shoulder, goes hand
	over hand to the top and the WOMAN is dumped into the
	MIDDLE CAR.

	INSERT: THE COUPLING bends open a little more.

	SPIDEY helps the TEENAGER and the SKINNY GIRL out of the
	CAR. She takes the dreadful step between cars. She looks
	down. She screams. She steps across.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	The FIRE LADDER is up. But it is about TEN FEET short of
	where it's aimed at. The end of the CAR. A FIREMAN
	stands at its apex.

				FIREMAN
			(into walkie)
		Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder!

	WALKIE
	Negative on that, you're at full
	extension!

	INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT

	Now only ROZ is left. SPIDEY approaches him. He clings
	to a POLE.

	INSERT: The COUPLING bends open! The CAR is hanging there
	from memory!

				ROZ
		This is Doctor Otto Octavius' work. I
		must get back to my university. I must
		stop Ock... he's gone crazy. Can you
		help me?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Sure thing, just don't take the train.
		Come on... give me your hand.

				ROZ
		Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do
		this with the train, if he's come this
		far, then I can pretty well predict his
		next step. He'll go to Plutonium SL 270
		for the power. He must be stopped... or
		else he'll destroy our world.

	The COUPLING shrieks and the CAR lurches.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Let's get you out of here first,
		Professor.

				ROZ
		Wait Spider-Man. I don't think I can
		make it... You mustn't waste time saving
		me... you must save the world! You must
		go and stop Ock!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Where can I find him...?

				ROZ
		He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I'm
		sure...

	The CAR lurches on its side and ROZ flies out of the DOOR.
	SPIDEY THWIPS out a WEB that girdles ROZ'S waist.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Think Rosomorf, think where one can find
		Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270...?

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	ROZ is hanging in mid-air on the WEB.
	ROZ shouts.

				ROZ
			(shouting)
		There's only one place he can get the
		Plutonium SL 270...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Where...?

				ROZ
		Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump
		would have SL 270.

	SPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ
	on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in
	the doorway, manipulating the WEB.

	The FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of
	steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With
	SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the
	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	COPS, FIREMEN, PRESS, the works. The CROWD GASPS. CAMERA
	STROBES pop as the LAST CAR crashes to the SIDEWALK. We
	hold several beats on the incredible rubble.

	Then, a WEBBED HAND. SPIDER-MAN groggily pulls himself
	from the wreckage.

				COP (V.O.)
		Put your hands up, Spider-Man.

				SPIDER-MAN
		You're making a big mistake.

				COP
		And you're looking at twenty years.

	SPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP'S GUN and
	leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO... and swings up out of the
	frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a
	THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet
	and falls limp.

				COP
		What the hell!

	EXT. BACK OF BUILDING - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the
	end of a WEB STRAND. After falling ten stories, he is
	groggy and weak. He can't think. He can't focus. He can
	barely hold onto his WRIST GIZMOS. This bug is spent.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270
		Plutonium... must get that crazy old
		loony... before he gets to the
		Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the
		toxic dumps...?

	He hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and
	thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across
	on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely.

	INT. AUNT MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	LIZ is standing. AUNT MAY is seated on the COUCH, she
	looks weak, pale and alone.

				AUNT MAY
		You're as lovely as Peter said you were.

				LIZ
			(embarrassed)
		Thank you. He really wanted so badly to
		come see you. He called me up out of the
		blue.

				AUNT MAY
			(great concern)
		Tell me about Peter. What's he been up
		to? He seems so preoccupied.

				LIZ
		Oh, you know Peter... he's all caught up
		in some kind of study he's doing. Things
		are really crazy at the university now.
		Things are crazy... everywhere. I guess
		Peter's just... well, you know... pulled
		into his shell.

				AUNT MAY
			(reminiscing)
		When Peter was little, he loved to hide.
		In the closets. Under the sink. He
		always needed a secret place. But when
		I'd look for him, he'd always laugh... he
		wanted to be found.

				LIZ
		Yeah... well. I don't think he wants me
		to find him... Well, I'd better be going.
		My friend Flash is picking me up.

				AUNT MAY
		This Flash... he isn't your boyfriend, is
		he?

				LIZ
		No... not really... I think you can guess
		why...

	They smile knowingly at each other.
	LIZ goes toward the DOOR.

				AUNT MAY
		Elizabeth...?
		She turns.

				AUNT MAY
		Finders keepers, losers weepers.

				LIZ
		What?

				AUNT MAY
		That's what I used to say to Peter when I
		found him.

	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN swings high above it. This is not the
	confident swinger with LIZ in his arms. This is a guy
	who's making it by the narrowest of margins. There is a
	traffic jam below.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Got to find Ock... got to find the toxic
		dumps.
			(grabs his head)
		Oh! Oh! Oh... yeah!

	He looks down at the traffic. We PAN across the many CARS
	until we come to a non-descript GREEN CAR.

	INT. GREEN CAR - NIGHT

	OCK is honking the HORN. Something lands on his ROOF.
	Then SPIDEY sticks his head, upside down, in the
	windshield.

				SPIDER-MAN
		What's up, Ock?

				OCK
		You!!!

	A WALDO smashes through the WINDSHIELD but misses SPIDEY.
	OCK leaps from the CAR.

				OCK
			(on the run)
		You're a doomed bug, Wall Crawler. I've
		no time to waste on you now.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	OCK runs through HONKING TRAFFIC. SPIDER-MAN leaps from
	CAR to CAR.

	OCK turns to see SPIDER-MAN leap to a LIMO at the curb.
	OCK turns tail and runs down an alley. A FEMALE COP pops
	out of a DOORWAY. Her partner, a BIG, YOUNG COP, pulls
	his GUN.

				FEMALE COP
			(gun poised)
		Alright! Freeze! Up against the wall
		and spread 'em

	OCK complies. He raises his hands... and spreads the
	WALDOS to full extension! The BIG COP screams and faints.
	The little FEMALE COP'S eyes POP. OCK swats the GUN from
	her hand. He starts to choke her.

	SPIDEY comes swinging to the rescue. He lands on the ROOF
	nearby.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hey, you big OCK, why don't you pick on
		someone your own size?!

				OCK
		Alright Spider-Bug... here I've come for
		you...

	OCK leaves the COP and attacks SPIDER-MAN, shooting his
	iron fist at him. OCK runs to the end of the alley.
	SPIDEY staggers to his feet and resumes the chase.
	OCK breaks into a red Corvette convertible, starting it
	with a WALDO.

	SPIDER-MAN comes out in time to see the Vette drive away.
	A CHINESE LAUNDRY TRUCK is passing. SPIDEY THWIPS it and
	is whipped away.

	He crawls over to the WINDOW.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hey, driver. Could you follow that red
		Vette for me?

	The surprised CHINAMAN lets loose a stream of CHINESE
	expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures.
	SPIDER-MAN crawls to the top of the TRUCK and surveys the
	situation. He sees a sea of moving traffic. He THWIPS up
	a WEB and swings away.

	SPIDEY swings along from BUILDING to BUILDING. The RED
	VETTE is making headway. Suddenly, SPIDER-MAN spots a
	blue MG with its top up.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(swinging)
		Flash Thompson... I never thought I'd be
		happy to see you.

	EXT. BLUE MG - NIGHT

	SPIDEY swoops down on the BLUE MG.

	INT. BLUE MG - NIGHT

	SPIDEY wedges down into the car, right between FLASH and
	LIZ. She WHOOPS. FLASH is thrilled.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Sorry about that!

				FLASH
		Spider-man! This is unbelievable...!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Flash, I need your help.

				FLASH
		You got it.

				SPIDER-MAN
		You any good with this thing?

				FLASH
		I'm the best.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay... catch that Vette!

				FLASH
		Roger, wilco, over and out.

	He swerves. SPIDEY falls all over LIZ. They begin to
	careen through traffic, three peas in a very small pod.

	EXT. WEST SIDE CAR CHASE MONTAGE - NIGHT

	With SPIDEY jammed in between LIZ and FLASH, the MG chases
	the VETTE. Since neither OCK nor FLASH is any good at
	this, both cars quickly careen into POLES, FENCES, HOT DOG
	CARS and begin falling apart.

	On RIVERSIDE DRIVE the MG begins to lurch and STEAM. The
	VETTE looks eaten away. The GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE
	looms ahead.

	The VETTE roars through the TOLL BOOTH. They spot OCK
	stuck in traffic.

				FLASH
		Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is
		it in that shitty red car...

				LIZ
		Don't you recognize him... it's Ock!

				SPIDER-MAN
		New Jersey has the largest toxic waste
		dump in the world.

				FLASH
		What does he want with toxic waste?

				SPIDER-MAN
		He's looking for Plutonium, my dear...
		The car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam.

				FLASH
		Sorry... can't do anything about this
		traffic.

	SPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Try to stay with me. I don't want to
		lose him!

	Speeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high
	above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At
	the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The
	VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For
	a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes
	it across.

	The VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN.
	He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take
	the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the
	ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It
	says, "DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!"

				SPIDER-MAN
		Bingo.

	INT. TOXIC WASTE DUMP - NIGHT

	The landscape has a nightmarish vision, weirdly lit by
	"safety lights." VATS and DRUMS ooze all kinds of bad
	stuff. A light is on in a dilapidated SHACK.

	INT. THE SHACK - NIGHT

	OCK is tossing away the CANISTERS until he comes to one
	marked, "HAZARD!! PLUTONIUM SL 270 HAZARD!!"

				OCK
		Okey, dokey...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Open that now, and you'll spoil Christmas.

	SPIDEY'S peering in from a HOLE in the ROOF.

				OCK
		Insect! I am going to squash you to
		death... Once I lay my Waldos on your
		skinny bones...

	OCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of
	LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the
	door with his SL 270.

	EXT. THE SHACK - NIGHT

	OCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO.
	SPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO
	snaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror.
	With a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as
	SUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses
	SPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes
	SPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing.

	EXT. THE DUMP - NIGHT

	OCK'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN'S neck as the
	WEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES
	narrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING
	SIGN. OCK tears off the CAP and then hurls the groggy
	SPIDEY down the WELL.

				OCK
		Goodbye, Spider-Man!

	INT. THE WELL - NIGHT

	SPIDEY falls. He cannot grab onto the slimy WALLS. At
	the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling BLUE luminescent
	POOL. SPIDEY claws frantically at the WALLS.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Noooooooooooooo!

	He gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the
	POOL. Its weird light shines up at him. He looks up at
	the starry sky.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(to himself)
		Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it.

	He shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the
	wall, sizzles, and drops back down.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(to himself)
		Don't give up, Spidey. Don't give up.

	The WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO.
	Then it hisses, empty!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Empty... now what do I do?

				OCK
		So you've avoided the nuclear pool, have
		you, Spider-Man?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Well, so far so good. But I can't hold
		on much longer.

				OCK
		Pity...!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport. Let's
		talk this over face to face... throw me a
		line...

	SPIDEY reaches out.

				OCK
		Okay... face to face... Catch this!

	OCK, way up at the opening above, raises a huge DRUM above
	his head. The DRUM leaks toxic waste in ORANGE TENDRILS.
	He is about to drop it down on SPIDER-MAN...

				FLASH
		Don't do it, Professor!

	We now see FLASH and LIZ in the BLUE MG.

				OCK
			(puts down the drum)
		I know you... and you, young lady. Both
		of you are in my physic class, aren't
		you...? Come... you can help me. I need
		to get some of these drums to my
		laboratory... help me... and I'll give
		you special grades. What'd you say?

	Suddenly he catches FLASH with a WALDO and starts to choke
	him. LIZ screams and tries to help FLASH.

				LIZ
		Leave him alone!!!

	Another WALDO grabs her.
	ROZ now appears on the scene.

				ROZ
		Leave them alone Otto!

				OCK
		But, they won't help me. Everybody is
		trying to destroy my experiment. And so
		are you, Rosomorf.

	Another WALDO grabs ROZ by his arm.

				ROZ
		Otto... I was wrong. I've gone over your
		research. It's brilliant, Otto. It's
		mad, but it's brilliant. You have much
		work left to do. I want to help you,
		Otto. For the sake of science, go and do
		your experiment. Leave... these kids
		alone and I'll help you.

				OCK
		You will? You too?

	Both FLASH and LIZ shake their heads okey dokey. OCK
	gestures to FLASH and LIZ.

				OCK
		Help me with these drums, I need to get
		them to my laboratory immediately.

				ROZ
		Do as he says.

	OCK pushes FLASH and LIZ with his iron arm. Gripping LIZ
	be her hair, he shoves her into the CAR.

				OCK
		Drive, Flash, before I flush your girl
		right down the toilet!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Professor Rosomorf, it's no good, double
		dealing... why did you help him...?

	ROSOMORF finds a rope and looks into the well.

				ROZ
		Don't lose your energy screaming. Catch
		this rope and climb up, come on!

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	They drive along the highway. SPIDEY is recovering,
	working his neck.

				ROZ
		I've been through the Octavius data. He
		has enough power with his Plutonium.
		Especially if he gets his hands on
		Parker's data, there he has enough power
		to do what he wants to do. And we are
		not going to stop him in time before the
		Planetary Conjunction occurs tonight...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Stop the car. I have an idea.

	They're in the middle of RIVERSIDE DRIVE but a PHONE BOOTH
	is coming up on the right.

	INSERT: ROZ'S foot stabs the BRAKE.

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY gets out of the car. Then he pats himself where
	his pockets ought to be.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Do you have a dime?

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	HARRY is there, working on the COMPUTER, PHONE RINGS,
	HARRY picks up.

				PETER
		Harry?!

				HARRY
		Peter, where are you?

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				SPIDER-MAN
		Listen, Harry. You must get my paper
		before Ock uses it...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				HARRY
		Your Planetary Conjunction data? It's
		too late... Ock's got your paper, it's in
		his computer already.

	INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays a graphic of the SUN,
	EARTH, and MOON lining up with JUPITER and SATURN.

				HARRY
		But don't worry... he can never use it
		without Plutonium.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
		He's got the Plutonium, and he's on his
		way back to the lab! And he's got two
		prisoners with him... Liz and Flash!

				HARRY
		Don't worry... he needs a huge amount of
		power... thousands of volts of
		electricity... to get to the Anti-Force.

				SPIDER-MAN
		He can get to the power. Electrical
		power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL
		270. And now, at the moment of full
		Planetary Conjunction. When all the
		planets line up with the sun... maximum
		gravitational power. The Conjunction is
		Ock's final power source.

				HARRY
		Damn... the Conjunction is due at
		midnight! What are we going to do?

	EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT

	The BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his
	two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself...
	Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder.

				OCK
		Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones...
		for the last time.

	OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back
	seat of the CAR.

				LIZ
			(still ministering)
		What do we do now?

				FLASH
		We kiss the world goodbye. If he is
		right, all there is left to do is...

				LIZ
		Wait... I think I can release my right
		hand...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				HARRY
		How much time is left? Wait... I can
		find out... my God... 59 minutes!

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				SPIDER-MAN
		The only way we can interfere with Ock's
		plan is to find a computer center... fast.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Our University has the biggest center in
		town.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Yeah, but who's gonna work 'em?

	EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT

	Professor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ
	and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS.
	HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school
	grounds.

				HARRY
		I think I can get some help... I can
		teach anyone how to work a code in five
		minutes.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
		Then do it!

	INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

	The LIGHTS are off, but the COMPUTERS are on. HARRY looks
	over LIZ'S shoulder as she cracks through a code. Her
	SCREEN reads out, "CONNECTICUT. TECH. Fully Op, Line
	Backlog, Security Max Level." The last line is FLASHING.

				KIM
		Hey, this is easy.

	They all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER.

				FLASH
		Hey, Harry I need help.

				HARRY
		Coming!

	HARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He
	looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. "01:00:02" becomes
	"00:59:59" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER!

				KIM
		I got one! I got one!

				LIZ
		Harry! Get over here!

	HARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the
	CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing "WARNING, Security Breach!"
	HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around.
	LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to
	small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a
	PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend
	"H20".

				HARRY
		A goddamn water leak...

				FLASH
		Hey, look at this. Empire State
		University. This is our cyclotron,
		right?

				HARRY
			(serious)
		What does it say?

				FLASH
			(hits two keys)
		It says "no information on net."

				HARRY
		Damn... we can't do it...

				KIM
		You mean... we can't stop loony Ock...

				HARRY
		I mean the world is in danger...

				FLASH
		We must find Peter, he knows these
		computers better than all of us.

				HARRY
		Yes, but where the hell is he?

				LIZ
			(mysteriously)
		I bet he is with Spider-Man...

	Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake.

	EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK

	The EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of
	the CONJUNCTION.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	HARRY and FLASH and LIZ and KIM, (the EARTH is SHAKING)
	come out running from the building beneath an enormous
	HANGING MOON. They are frightened.

	Suddenly it all stops. It's quiet, the kids look at the
	sky.

				LIZ
		Look at the moon... I have never seen it
		so big.

				FLASH
		What is that...

				HARRY
		Must be the sun.

	We now see the sky. With the sun on one side, and the
	moon on the other. They watch it, shocked, frightened out
	of their wits.

	EXT. END OF THE WORLD MONTAGE - NIGHT

	Suddenly from OCK'S basement lab a BLUE BEAM of LIGHT
	breaks through. A WHINE starts, it moves magically out of
	the WINDOW and PANS around a sleepy NEW YORK which doesn't
	know that the end is upon it. The dreaded WHINE builds
	throughout! People stop in their tracks, look up to the
	strange looking skyline. Camera comes down to a street
	where ROZ is DRIVING SPIDER-MAN fast toward the
	UNIVERSITY.

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	ROZ looks out over the skyline of NEW YORK. Lighted
	buildings FLARE UP and then GO DARK. The LIGHTED SPIRE of
	the Empire State Building FLARES UP and EXPLODES.

				SPIDER-MAN
		It's started. Step on it Professor, or
		we'll never make it.

	They look across the campus and a strange LIGHT is coming
	out of the SCIENCE CENTER.

				ROZ
		Our campus... right there... see those
		beams from Ock's lab. We're late... it's
		coming... the Conjunction will happen in
		a few seconds.

	SPIDER-MAN massages his arm.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Stop the car...! Come with me.

				ROZ
		Where...? What...?

	SPIDER-MAN SHOOTS out a WEB and flies toward the SCHOOL
	BUILDING taking ROZ with him.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	It is a patchwork of make-shift repairs. OCK looks in
	through a WINDOW that's been melted out. He is lost in a
	mad rapture.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	RED POWER THROTTLE is at 95% POWER!
	SPIDER-MAN and ROZ enter, shielding their eyes from the
	GLARE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:08:18".

				OCK
			(looking back, madly)
		Aha! You never included the Conjunction
		in your calculations, did you?! Rosomorf!

				ROZ
		Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you
		have to hear me! The world we know will
		collapse! Everything we have devoted our
		lives to... all the patterns, all the
		harmonies... everything will be destroyed.

				OCK
		A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my
		destiny!!!

				ROZ
		It is cosmic suicide! You have no right!

	ROZ flings himself through the MELTED WINDOW into the
	EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. He grabs for the "BULLET" but the
	WALDOS grab him and throw him back. ROZ staggers
	backward... into the arms of SPIDER-MAN.

				ROZ
		You have to stop him... Spider-Man you
		have to stop him.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I'm afraid we're too late.

	SPIDER-MAN attacks OCK, trying to push him away from the
	THROTTLE. OCK pushes SPIDER-MAN away from him so strongly
	that SPIDER-MAN is knocked down. OCK nudges the POWER
	THROTTLE forward and the WHINE increases to an ear
	shattering pitch. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:06:48".
	We are at 96% POWER!

	EXT. THE SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	We PAN down from the MOON to a STREET full of SIRENS and
	SHADOWY FIGURES running in the night. LIZ and KIM and
	HARRY come nearer. A very WEIRD light is emanating from
	the CENTER.

				LIZ
		He's in there. I know Peter is in there.
		She breaks into a run.

				FLASH
		Liz, don't... Liz come back... come back!
		LIZ runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF
		ELECTRICITY flashes across the doorway, stopping them.

	INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The PLANETS are playing on the COMPUTER SCREEN. Things in
	the room begin to rise, weightless. The ENERGY STORM is
	brewing!

				OCK
		Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has
		started. My Anti-Force is on! History
		is being made... Spider-Man, Rosomorf
		cheer up friends... we're on our way to
		the unknown cosmos... we three are about
		to visit heaven... real Gods heaven.

				ROZ
			(sees the sky through the window)
		Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It's
		happening!

	EXT. THE SKY - STRANGE COLORS - NIGHT

	The CONJUNCTION is now happening.

	INSERT: Surreal DIALS spin madly.

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	LIZ runs into a HALLWAY gone berserk. Stuff is flying
	everywhere. TILES pull from the WALLS and crash to the
	ceiling.

				LIZ
		Peter! Peter, where are you?!

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK throws the RED POWER THROTTLE to 97% POWER.
	Cacophony! The "BULLET" begins to PULSE and THROB! The
	DIALS spin! The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:05:58".

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	The FULL MOON hangs over the building. FLASH and HARRY
	and KIM stand at the entrance to the CENTER.
	FLASH starts to run to the building.

				FLASH
			(screaming)
		Liz! Liz come on out!

	They run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the
	building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall
	of STONE and DIRT, six feet high.

				HARRY
		Get back! Flash... get back!

				FLASH
		Wow...!

	Then the building lurches upward again! This time it
	pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER
	LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK.

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ opens a door.

				LIZ
		Peter!

	The building lurches throwing her back across the HALL
	where she crashes through another door.

	INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT

	All manner of stuff is flying around. LIZ comes sliding
	across the floor. She crashes into a CABINET. GLASSWARE
	starts to fall on her, but crashes into the CEILING
	instead. She is dragged up the WALL. She kicks and
	screams against the Anti-Force.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	FLASH, KIM and HARRY look on as heavy ELECTRICAL CABLES
	stretch upward to the rising CENTER and then snap in
	showers of sparks. As they fall away the CENTER becomes
	airborne. The CABLES wave up at it, shooting arcs of
	ELECTRICITY directly at the building.

	INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT

	LIZ slides down the WALL. She grabs at the WINDOW and
	looks out. The rest of the university recedes beneath
	her, now a hundred feet below. And they're still rising!
	FLASH and HARRY look up.

				FLASH
		Oh my God... Liz is inside there!

				HARRY
		And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock.

				FLASH
		What about Peter? Is he there with them?

				HARRY
		No, but I bet Spider-Man is.

	EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	People look up at the SCIENCE CENTER. A CYCLIST, riding
	and looking, crashes into a TAXI. MAX REISS leaps out
	with the BEAUTIFUL STARLET from the TAXI.

				MAX
		That's some show... if ever I saw one.

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	He's looking out his window seeing the University's Lab
	Building flying by. Up and up toward the sky.

				JAMESON
			(shouting)
		Tear out the front page! Change the
		headline... The biggest news is happening
		right now... we need photos... a camera...
		get me a camera...!

	EXT. SKY - NIGHT

	A very long shot of the SCIENCE CENTER rising into the
	CLOUDS.

	INT. AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She pulls aside a CURTAIN and watches the SCIENCE CENTER
	rise.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK works the COMPUTER as the CONSOLE sends up SHOWERS of
	SPARKS. He glances at the "BULLET" which now PULSES.
	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK at "00:04:18".

				ROZ
		Where is it going Otto?

				OCK
		Other worlds, Roz, other times, other
		dimensions, who knows? Who cares?

				ROZ
		Then... why?

				OCK
		Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new
		truth! The new way!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Don't listen to him Professor Roz.

				OCK
		No, you don't listen to that clown, he
		can't save you, or the world for that
		matter.

	A WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him
	back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE
	STATION (HOSE, EXTINGUISHER, AXE).

	We see the WALDO reach out for SPIDER-MAN. It wraps
	around his FOOT and begins to tug, slowly...

				OCK
		Once and for all, Spider-Man... once and
		for all we'll end the legend of your
		powers.

	OCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO.
	OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that's
	been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY.
	We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We
	see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes
	flying in with the FIRE AXE.

	ROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump
	withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury!

				OCK
			(ultimate betrayal)
		You!! You were my teacher!!!

	ROZ doesn't even look back. He and SPIDEY are at the edge
	of the HOLE and he's shaking SPIDEY furiously.
	OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the
	floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY. Like
	a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the
	floor again and again.

				OCK
		You were my teacher! And you want to
		destroy my experiment. You are a
		scientist for heaven sake... don't you
		want to know what's up there?

				ROZ
		Yes, but not on account of our world. We
		have only one world... only one life.
		The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a
		hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as the
		section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and
		falls through.

	SPIDEY grabs hold of the edge and dangles. He looks down
	and sees ROZ falling away beneath him, disappearing into
	the dark.

				ROZ
			(calling back from the dark skies)
		Spider-Man! Only you can save us now...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Roz!!!
			(turns to Ock)
		Murderer!!!

				OCK
		Forget that old fool, insect. My
		Spider-Man... Come join me on my
		fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven.

	EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK

	The PLANETS are virtually in line!

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ comes running through it. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY
	shoots from the right to the left in front of her. She
	slams on the brakes and runs the other way.

				LIZ
		Peter! Peter!

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:02:59". OCK throws the
	POWER THROTTLE to 98% POWER. He laughs and a WEB splats
	against his GLASSES. SPIDEY scrambles to his feet. OCK,
	still trying to get the WEB GOO off his GLASSES, is
	slammed into the CONSOLE by SPIDER-MAN. SPARKS fly and
	WALDOS flail blindly, smashing things. OCK tears off his
	GLASSES and squints through the FIRE and SMOKE and GLARE.
	SPIDER-MAN THWIPS the ceiling and swings into a drop kick!
	OCK recovers. He grabs SPIDEY and slam dunks him through
	the hole in the floor.

	EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN falls through the air. He shoots up a WEB and
	THWIPS, it sticks to the ROCKY bottom of the FOUNDATION.
	OCK appears in the HOLE. He sees SPIDEY'S dilemma,
	hanging on a thread of WEB. A half-broken WALDO snakes
	down and CLIPS the WEB.

	But the WEB sticks to the WALDO! OCK shakes it, but he
	can't get loose. SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the
	ROCK BOTTOM and, with the leverage, he pulls OCK out.
	OCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the
	ROCK upside down. He holds on fiercely.

	OCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins
	looking for an entry. SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail.
	The building pitches sideways! OCK turns to face SPIDER-
	MAN, his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE.

	SPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off,
	brandishing it like a broad sword.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Let's have it, old boy!
		A bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way
		and that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold,
		from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET.

	Now the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL
	upside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes
	flying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Liz!!
		OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the
		head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now
		lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY
		ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE.

	SPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of
	SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Come on.

				LIZ
		Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(pulling her ahead)
		He's around, don't worry... we'll find
		him.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:01:00" as SPIDEY comes
	flying in with LIZ in tow.

				LIZ
		This building is flying. I'm in a
		goddamn flying building...

				SPIDER-MAN
		I think we have to pull some of these
		cables. Try those over there. I'll work
		on these. We gotta slow this thing down
		somehow. We got helicopters coming.

	LIZ looks at some WIRING, apprehensive about even touching
	it.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Pull!

	She yanks out a CABLE. The building pitches. But when
	SPIDEY pulls one out, it rights itself.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	The BIG BEAMS start cutting out one by one. The CENTER
	begins to PITCH and YAW. The CHOPPERS are getting closer.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:00:15" as SPIDEY and LIZ
	continue to pull WIRES and CABLES. TWO WALDOS erupt
	through the floor and grab SPIDEY. They pull SPIDEY to
	the floor. Entangled in these molybdimum pythons, SPIDEY
	struggles valiantly. LIZ leaps to his aid.

				LIZ
		Oh my God...

	A third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and
	begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER
	THROTTLE.

				SPIDER-MAN
		The power!

	LIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE.
	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at "00:00:10". LIZ leaps and tries
	to wrestle it away. It whips in her arms and she holds on
	tight. It bangs her against the wall and then the
	CONSOLE. She holds on. "00:00:03". The WALDO crashes
	LIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS. She lets go
	of it. It heads for the POWER THROTTLE! "00:00:01!"
	SPIDER-MAN can't break the grip of the WALDOS, but he can
	pull with super-human strength. He yanks OCK up through
	the STONE floor. OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL
	ROOM. ONE WALDO grabs on. The other one throws the RED
	POWER THROTTLE!

				OCK
		Spider-Man. You're end is coming. Life
		in its present form is ending... new
		dimensions, new horizons...

	The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to
	a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a
	rushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room
	towards the POINT of LIGHT.

				LIZ
			(bracing against the storm)
		What is happening?

				SPIDER-MAN
			(similarly braced)
		I don't know!!!

	LIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles
	against it.

				LIZ
		I can't... hold on!

	SPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hold tight, Liz, hold tight!

	OCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room.
	He moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT.

				OCK
			(spaced out)
		You cut my power... there's too little
		power... It's so tiny... so tiny...
		there's only space... for me. But I've
		done it, Spider-Man. I have broken
		through... I've broken through!

				LIZ
		Don't do it, Dr. Octavius!

				OCK
		Okey... dokey... Now that's what I call
		an experiment!!!

	As he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it.
	He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the
	room with BLINDING LIGHT.

	SPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light
	diminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for
	the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet
	above the city!

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	Against the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of
	HELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE
	CRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER
	begins to drop in PULSING SURGES.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN is at the CONSOLE pulling and putting back
	WIRES. LIZ, fascinated, looks in at the WINDOW where OCK
	disappeared.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I can't control her. She's dropping too
		fast! Alright... let's go!

				LIZ
		But what about Peter? We've got to find
		Peter!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Peter will be okay, I promise you...
		Let's go before it's too late.
			(he grabs her)

				LIZ
		Go where?

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the
	cavalry.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	Trying to leave it, LIZ and SPIDEY are confronted with a
	nightmare. The room is tilted at a 45% angle. PIPES are
	bursting. SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles. Debris
	rains down. They come face to face with a diagonal maze
	of PIPES.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Maybe there's another way...

	A HUGE CRACK opens above them.

				LIZ
		It's breaking apart!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Alright, keep moving, a step at a time!

	They scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side,
	half the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000
	feet below.

				LIZ
		We have to go back.

				SPIDER-MAN
		We can't go back.

	He looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal
	wall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between
	themselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ.

				LIZ
		Forget it...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, have it your way.

	He swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then
	he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze.
	LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN,
	furious.

				LIZ
			(shouting across)
		What am I supposed to do with this!

				SPIDER-MAN
			(shouting back)
		Go ahead. It's easier than it looks!
		We've got to try the fire escape.

	LIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on
	the LEDGE. She does a comic "phew" and the LEDGE buckles
	beneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the
	door, but it's stuck.

				LIZ
		The door is stuck.

	SPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his
	strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR
	open.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	They burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building.
	New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by
	their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the
	falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS
	look across at each other, helpless.

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It drops like a stone.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding
	along the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL.
	SPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then
	disappears over the edge. LIZ screams!

	LIZ fights to her feet and grabs onto the WEB STAND. She
	pulls on it with all her strength. She pulls and pulls
	and pulls. We see the WEB running up between the ROCKS.
	She gives one last pull and comes up with an EMPTY WEB
	END.

	A long, long beat.

				PETER (V.O.)
		Liz, Up here!

	LIZ looks up and sees PETER hanging out the WINDOW two
	stories above her. He throws out a ROPE LADDER. LIZ
	grabs it. She begins to climb.

	INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

	PETER pulls LIZ through the WINDOW. There is no time for
	an embrace.

				PETER
		Come on. I've found a way down.

				LIZ
			(at long last, love)
		I knew you were going to say that.

	They run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled
	beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit.

	INT. LARGE PHYSICS LAB - NIGHT

	This is the LAB we saw in the opening sequence. PETER has
	turned on the lights. He's got a handful of ROPE.

				LIZ
		Where's the way out?

				PETER
		Right there!

	We are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG.

				PETER
		Come on, help me with this.

	EXT. THE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

	LIZ is already down the ROPE LADDER and is holding it for
	PETER. He comes down with a HUGE bundle of RED, WHITE &
	BLUE.

				PETER
		Okay, stand still.

	He ties some ROPE around her waist.

				LIZ
		Is this going to work?

				PETER
		How do I know?

				LIZ
		I just adore confidence in a man.

				PETER
		Come on...

	They move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL
	PARK is still a couple thousand feet down.

				LIZ
		What is it you say when you jump?

				PETER
		Your prayers.

	They SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them
	to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They
	reach out for each other but their hands don't quite
	reach.

	Slowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks
	between them.

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And
	then it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of
	debris shoots upward.

	EXT. THE SKY - NIGHT

	There is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down
	into the frame lit by its wonderful light.

	The AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute.
	They hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below.
	They begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The
	wind billows LIZ'S skirt and plays with PETER'S hair, and
	snaps in the AMERICAN FLAG.

				LIZ
		We have a lot to thank your friend
		Spider-Man for.

				PETER
		Somehow, I don't think we've seen the
		last of him.

				LIZ
		Peter...! Finders, keepers...

				PETER
		What...? What is it? Why do you look
		like that?

				LIZ
		I think I'm in love.

				PETER
			(even his eyes blush)
		You are...

				LIZ
		With your friend...

				PETER
		Spider-Man? You're in love with
		Spider-Man?

				LIZ
		I am... you think we'll see him again?

				PETER
		We might... you never know.
		He kisses her.

				LIZ
		Oh.
			(bittersweet)
		This may be the end of a beautiful
		friendship you know?

				PETER
		Nah.

	They land in the center of the park under the parachute.
	They stay there and kiss... completely covered by the
	flag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.

	SECOND REV.
	7/29/1993



	FADE IN:
	INT. PROFESSOR OCK"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE
	CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY

	A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED
	WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes.

	Several DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a
	YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE.
	We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL
	climbs to "5% POWER." A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL.

	Begin OPENING CREDITS.

	THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling
	paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and
	there. COBWEBS are all around.

	DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange
	featured man in his mid-fifties.

	His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's
	open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is
	a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the
	school administration and to "procure" whatever OCK needs
	for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing
	BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS
	DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS.

				WEINER
		Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?

	With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with
	shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor.

				OCK
			(rising)
		We begin again... let's kick in that new
		transducer. See if we can double the
		power output.

				WEINER
			(rising more slowly)
		Whoa, Doc... wait a minute...

	But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls
	up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK
	looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL
	CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, "eight, nine..."
	the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is
	shattering.

	END OPENING CREDITS.

				OCK
		Okey... dokey!

	The POWER DIAL hits ten.

	EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY

	As STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills
	out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State
	University.

	We see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who's among
	the top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to
	develop a way with women.

				LIZ
			(falling in step)
		Hiya Peter...

	LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and
	intelligent.

				PETER
			(ardent but
			uncomfortable)
		Hiya Liz... how're you doing...?

				LIZ
			(teasing softly)
		How'm I doing what?

				HARRY
		Peter! Peter! Wait up!

	HARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER,
	can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty
	ones like Liz.

				HARRY
			(to Liz)
		Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?

	Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him
	away like a conspirator.

				PETER
		What is it? what...

				HARRY
		Did the Astro-Physics Journal really
		accept your paper?

				PETER
			(laughs, embarrassed)
		Yeah... well... all I got's the data but
		they've agreed to publish it when it's
		finished. You know... it's my
		calculation on the Planetary Conjunction.

				HARRY
		And its influence on the anti-force.
		Isn't it?

				PETER
		Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with...
			(indicates Liz standing
			there)

				HARRY
		Yeah, you and the rest of the class.
		Every one is busy with Liz.

				LIZ
			(growing impatient)
		Peter?

	A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom.

				FLASH
		Hiya, cupcakes...

				LIZ
			(elbowing him
			affectionately)
		Flash...!

	They kiss and walk away.

				HARRY
			(sneering)
		And Flash is the busiest of them all...

				PETER
			(disappointed)
		Come on, Harry... we'll be late for
		Octavius.

	HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.

				HARRY
		Ock is nuts, don't you agree?

				PETER
		Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But,
		a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.

	INT. CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY

	It is a basement hallway full of LOCKERS which STUDENTS
	are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take
	stuff out. In their midst, a MAN is banging on the door
	marked "Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only!"
	Professor ROSOMORF, SIXTISH, respectable, a good old
	fashioned professor, he's the head of the Physics Dept.
	With him is ALEXANDER THORKEL, a 40-ish, Waspish school
	administrator. For a scientist as crazily focused as OCK,
	THORKEL is a natural enemy.

				ROZ
			(knocking furiously)
		Doctor Octavius! You are late for your
		lecture. The students are waiting.
		Doctor Octavius!

				THORKEL
		Your friend is impossible Professor
		Rosomorf, I told the board we should let
		him go.

	The LIGHT above THORKEL's head EXPLODES. Then all the
	LIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession. THORKEL and ROZ
	look amazed...

				THORKEL
		What's he doing in there, not his crazy
		experiment again.

				ROZ
		You mean his anti-force theory... one day
		they'll give him the Nobel Prize for it.

				THORKEL
		Meanwhile he is demolishing our
		university. Octavius!!
			(knocks)
		Open the door.

	INT. OCK'S LAB

				OCK
		The anti-force experiment has now reached
		the limit of electronic overload safety.
		Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect
		the overload safety device...

	FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms)
	suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin
	working, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged
	master at manipulating these WALDOS.

	He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances
	down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT
	marked, "1,000,000"), illuminating it and filling our
	ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE.

	The knock on the door grows louder.
	WEINER comes up behind OCK.

				WEINER
		Whoa, Doc... someone's at the door...

				OCK
			(ignoring)
		World class scientific mind and they
		stick me in the basement with this third
		rate cyclotron...

	INSERT: The DIAL marked "RELATIVE GRAVITY" reads
	"1,000,000" but suddenly it snaps to "0.999999!"

				OCK
		Okey! Dokey!

	The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it
	appears to lift ever so slightly.

	INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

	This is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. The yellowing
	smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. A HUGE
	AMERICAN FLAG dominates the back wall.

	PETER, HARRY and LIZ set up their TABLES. FLASH reads the
	DAILY BUGLE sports section. PETER can't take his eyes off
	LIZ. When she looks back he looks down at his GEAR.

				LIZ
			(softly)
		What is it, Peter?

				PETER
			(embarrassed)
		It's nothing.

	INT. OCK'S LAB

	WEINER opens the door and sees ROZ and THORKEL waiting
	impatient.

				WEINER
		Yes, gentleman can I help you?

				THORKEL
		Tell your boss, that his class is waiting.

				WEINER
			(looks)
		You better tell him yourself.

	THORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder, then the both
	call.

				ROZ & THORKEL
		Professor Octavius!!

	Professor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men.

				OCK
		Gentlemen, come, you must see this.

				ROZ
		But, your students...

				OCK
		The imbeciles can wait... I have better
		things to do than teach introductory
		Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are
		kindless adolescence.

				THORKEL
		You see he is impossible.

				OCK
		Thorkel you are the dummiest
		administrator our university has ever had.
			(Thorkel turns to go)
		Don't go Thorkel!! Come! Look!

	He starts to play his machines handles and buttons.

				THORKEL
		The university pays you to teach
		something to your students.

	INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

				LIZ
		Well, do you mean nothing... or do you
		mean something but you won't tell me what
		it is?

				PETER
			(regaining)
		I mean plain nothing.

				LIZ
		Well, I guess that's about as nothing as
		you can get... plain nothing.
		A beat.

				PETER
		Liz...!

				LIZ
		Ahh, it is something.

				PETER
		No... look.

	The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They
	look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE
	begin to build...

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY

	Everything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and
	Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with
	anger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is
	blinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over
	his ears.

				OCK
		I am going for 20 percent power!

				THORKEL
		NO!! Don't do that...

				ROZ
		Ock! Its dangerous...

				THORKEL
		Ock I warn you...

	WEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks.

	INT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY

	We follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along
	the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is
	making its way up to the LAB!

	INT. LAB - DAY

	All the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating
	equipment.

	The CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ'S TABLE.
	A BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD
	LIBS: "Fire!" "Everybody out!"

	THORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing
	LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second
	to second.

				THORKEL
		Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the
		front door. Everybody out the front.

				PETER
		Liz! Come on...!

				LIZ
		I can't. Help me!

				PETER
		I'm coming!

	He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES.
	His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out.

				LIZ
		Peter!

	Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him.

				THORKEL
		Get back, you idiots. You can't go in
		there!

	LIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city
	school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz
	wraps her fingers in the GATE.

				LIZ
			(out at the street)
		Help! Help me!

	Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and
	go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the
	second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course)
	down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her.

	PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He
	fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the
	extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain.
	LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an
	eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE
	EXTINGUISHER.

	The FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out.
	FLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER.

				PETER
		Thanks for your help Flash.

				FLASH
		No problem wimp.

				PETER
		Our hero has a real way with words.

				LIZ
		Oh, why don't you grow up.

	PETER is stung, insulted, turns away.
	ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel.

				THORKEL
		This man will bring a disaster upon this
		university.

	OCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has
	happened.

				OCK
		The universe is made up of forces... and
		counter-forces. Science is the study of
		the forces!

	FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces
	FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely.
	He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on
	the last of the FIRE.

				OCK
			(continues without a
			hitch)
		But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have
		devoted my life to the study of the
		counter-forces! Good job, Peter.

				PETER
			(taking place at lab
			table)
		Thanks, Professor.

	THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the
	front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S
	behavior.

				THORKEL
		I don't believe it, I simply don't...

				OCK
		Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel.

				THORKEL
		I don't believe... oh, all right carry on
		Professor.

				OCK
		Well! This week my dear students I have
		made a stunning breakthrough...

				THORKEL
		Wait a minute, wait a minute... you've
		got fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius.

				OCK
		I have no time for forms, or
		administrators who persist in
		interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel.

	THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR.

				OCK
		I now believe its possible that these
		counter forces can be... collected... the
		way the magnifying glass collects the
		sunlight... and focused into a hard beam
		I call... Weiner!

	WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word
	that OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says "Anti-
	Force."

				OCK
		I call it, the Anti-Force!

	OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with
	a SILVER BALL inside it.

				OCK
			(continues as he works)
		This anti-force, once harnessed, is
		capable of undoing any natural force at
		which it is aimed... for instance...
			(looks up maniacally)
		Gravity!

	LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity."
	Then she turns to PETER.

				LIZ
			(whispers)
		I'm sorry...

				PETER
		It's alright.

	OCK is "playing" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the
	Opera at the organ.

				OCK
		We patch in the cyclotron...
		The lights flicker and go dim.

				OCK
		Pay no attention to the lights... I of
		course steal its energy, and it looses
		power. We patch in the cyclotron... and
		we gradually apply power. The power that
		I am stealing...

	As the WHINE builds in the LAB...
	OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it.

	The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron's
	experimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins.
	It crackles round the SILVER BALL.

				OCK
		And so we stand, four square against the
		fundamental force that orders and
		maintains our universe... gravity...
		which is holding down this goddamn ball.
		Rise!

	The LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS
	and CATCALLS.

				HARRY
		What a crock...

				PETER
		Shut up Harry... this is very interesting.

				OCK
		Mr. Parker! Have you some... interesting
		observation you'd like to share with the
		class?

				PETER
		No sir...

				OCK
		Then shut up! And pay some attention to
		the experiment.

	OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL
	begins to rise. OCK'S face is ecstatic.

				OCK
		Rise! Rise!!!

	The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of
	the box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a
	LIGHT FIXTURE.

	The shards rain down on OCK who reaches out and catches
	the falling BALL and scales it in a raised fist.

				OCK
		Now that's what I call an experiment!

	The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the
	COMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION
	BEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the
	smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front.

	TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where
	their circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK
	depiction of "space".

				OCK
		You are looking at a representation of
		two universes. Our Blue one. Our real
		universe... something we can touch and
		feel and see and draw calculations about.
		This is us. The Yellow universe... this
		is something else. Some other dimension...
		something... on the other side!

	OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the
	TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with
	each other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are
				BRIGHT GREEN.

				OCK
		If it were possible to generate enough
		power behind it, the anti-force could
		wipe out not just gravity... but all our
		universal forces at the same time. In
		effect... it would blast a hole between
		this universe and the next. Each...
			(indicates green spheres)
		would flow into each other. No blue
		universe. No yellow. End, finished,
		over.

				LIZ
			(with a student's ear)
		That sounds like a scenario for the end
		of the world.

				OCK
		My girl, it is! It is. It would mean
		wiping out everything that's known... and
		letting in everything that's unknown.

				FLASH
		Isn't that a little dangerous?

				OCK
		Don't worry yourself, true inter-
		dimensional penetration is still purely
		theoretical, but one day... Maybe very
		near... maybe in the 21st century...

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

	PETER, LIZ, FLASH and HARRY all take BOOKS from their
	LOCKERS.

				LIZ
			(whispers to Peter)
		Look, it's just... I don't know... when
		you and Flash go after each other like
		that...

				PETER
			(whispers)
		He's not my type.

				LIZ
		He doesn't have to be.

				PETER
		Check.

				LIZ
		And besides, he's not all bad.

	PETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has
	taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his
	finger with great joy and concentration.

				PETER
		You don't get nicknamed Flash because
		you're a rocket scientist, Liz.

				LIZ
		Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a
		nickname like Flash.

				PETER
		Yeah, of embarrassment.

	KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is
	a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!

				KIM
			(teasing)
		Hey, Flash... I'm scalping a pair of the
		Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow
		night.

				FLASH
		The Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!!

				KIM
		Would you pay $125?

				FLASH
		Well, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell
		you tomorrow?

				KIM
			(moving on)
		You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz...

				LIZ
		Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is
		my new roommate... Kim Nickson.

	KIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her
	LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the
	boys.

	They go bug-eyed!

				KIM
			(interested)
		Hellooo, Peter.

				PETER
			(embarrassed)
		Hi...

				LIZ
		We're going to the Student Reunion
		Meeting. You coming?

	Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's
	adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in
	the ribs. Yeah, yeah!

				PETER
			(frustrated)
		I can't... I gotta go over to the Daily
		Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos.

				KIM
		Soooh, a photographer...?

				PETER
		Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting
		you, Kim.

				KIM
		Yeah... I bet it would be.

				HARRY
		Can I be your date for the reunion
		ShooShoo?

				KIM
		No Jerk!

				HARRY
			(she turns to go)
		What did I say...

				LIZ
		It's not what you said, it's how you say
		it, ShooShoo!

	Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his
	bag down.

				HARRY
		Damn!

	PETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking
	WEINER.

				WEINER
		Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you.

				PETER
		About my data I bet.

				WEINER
		I don't know.

				PETER
		He knows about my work on the Planetary
		Conjunction, doesn't he?

				WEINER
			(lies)
		I don't know.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	PETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER. This place is a far
	cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It's a fantastic
	netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one
	but PETER.

	OCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER.
	He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is
	OCK'S domain.

				PETER
		Hello, Professor Octavius.
			(no response)
		I really admired your experiment.

				OCK
			(back to Peter)
		We have a lot of interests in common,
		Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads
		together, if you know what I mean...

				PETER
			(flattered)
		That would be... great.

				OCK
			(turns with a smile)
		Now you take the Planetary Conjunction.
		This Saturday night we will witness
		Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the
		Sun... all in a row. Never seen within
		the memory of man, or measured for its
		effect. The total gravitational force
		must be quite exceptional. Isn't that
		the subject of your paper...?

				PETER
		Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to
		calculate the combined gravitational
		effect.

				OCK
		I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think
		I could find the time to go over it with
		you. Make sure it all... checks out.

				PETER
		Well... I'm sort of working with
		Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we
		kind of keep it between us. He thinks
		that my theory is... well, I don't know...

				OCK
			(to himself)
		The scoundrel...
			(turns angry)
		I want to see that data, Peter!

				PETER
		But Professor Octavius... if I knew you
		were interested... sorry, I've already
		given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he
		is after all the head of our Physics
		Department... and I couldn't...

	OCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly.

				OCK
		Well, I'm certain something can be worked
		out. Run along, young man.

	PETER begins to leave.

				OCK
		Just a minute... how about if I show you
		my discoveries... something I never
		showed to any other student... as a
		matter of fact to anybody at all.

				PETER
		Well I am really flattered, I mean I'd
		love to... but I...

				OCK
		Very well shall we say if you come here
		tonight...

				PETER
		But Professor I don't now if I should...

				OCK
		Make it eight sharp... I'll be waiting
		for you... Right here...

	Peter looks worried then leaves.

	OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling.

				OCK
		The same academic world that's so keen to
		embrace that boy's undergraduate work,
		ridicules my anti-force theory as
		quackery. I ask you, Weiner... what is
		our society coming to? Ha!

				WEINER
		They are all a bunch of brainless
		assholes, that's what I say...

				OCK
		Weiner! Go get me that boy's data!

				WEINER
		Cost you fifty bucks.

				OCK
			(Weiner hissing)
		Just get it. We'll negotiate your fee
		when you have the data, alright Weiner?

	EXT. DAILY BUGLE - DAY

	Establish as ART DECO BUILDING well beyond its prime. A
	sign says: "The Daily Bugle." Peter enters the building.

				JAMESON (V.O.)
		Garbage! Absolute, 100% garbage!

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY

	Very forties, very messy. J. Jameson scans some PHOTOS as
	PETER stands helplessly by.

				JAMESON
		Bag ladies. I hate bag ladies.

				PETER
		Yes, sir.

	JAMESON is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top.
	He too is forties. His chewed up CIGAR is forties. This
	guy is a hard case.

				JAMESON
			(looks at the other photos)
		Little kids... I hate little kids. This
		is a daily newspaper. We need news value
		photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit!

				PETER
		Yes, sir.

	JAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with a
	MOHAWK. PETER smiles in anticipation.

				JAMESON
		Kid? You want a pro's assessment?

				PETER
		Yes, sir!

				JAMESON
			(handing photos back)
		Your photos suck.
			(cigar for emphasis)
		Parker, my readers are morons. I gotta
		grab them by the eyes. Every time you
		press the button of that Nikon of yours
		it costs you fifty-five cents. So the
		next time you're about to take the plunge,
		ask yourself, am I taking dog bites man?
		Because if you are...

				PETER
		I know, I know. You want man bites dog...

				JAMESON
		Parker, this is the post modern 20th
		century. I want man eats dog! Get out!

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A seedy east village walk up. Peter takes his camera and
	takes various shots of a wino. ALL IN. He climbs the
	stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he
	collects from a beaten down mailbox.

				PETER
			(reading)
		Rent! Rent, more bills, rent...
		electricity, bills...

	INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and
	papers. A photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen
	pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and
	lenses. Self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs,
	wind-up toys, a stuffed carp. An unmade bed and a 50's
	dinette set are the only furniture. A grimy skylight
	leads to the roof. It's not a pretty place, but it has
	personality. A voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an
	intruder, is sneaking around.

				PETER
		There's nothing in there worth stealing!

				MAY (V.O.)
			(from within the kitchen)
		That's the understatement of the year.

				PETER
		Aunt May, you're trespassing.

				MAY
			(comes in)
		I was just so desperately bored... I
		thought I'd come over and make you dinner...

				PETER
		I am old enough to... to make my own--

				MAY
		But I didn't feel like getting to know
		your roaches.

				PETER
		I'll introduce you.

				MAY
		Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots...

				PETER
		I take pictures, remember?

				MAY
		Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for
		dinner in Forest Hills...

	She grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his
	shoulder.

				PETER
		It's Friday night...

				MAY
		Yes. Do you have a date?

				PETER
		No.

				MAY
		Then come on.

	INT. LARGE COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

	It is dark and empty except for COMPUTERS. Sitting at it,
	lit by the GLOW of its screen, is SOLOMON ROSOMORF (ROZ).
	As he works, a DOOR opens behind him. Someone walks
	quietly through the LAB. ROSOMORF keeps working. The
	intruder approaches...

				THORKEL
			(at his ear)
		Professor Rosomorf, what happened here?

				ROZ
		Someone tried to rob me of some paper...
		I suspect they were looking for that one.

				THORKEL
		What is it?

				ROZ
			(unruffled)
		Award winning stuff.
			(turning slightly)
		Peter Parker's data on the Planetary
		Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my
		computer under another title.

				THORKEL
		My God, what's going on in our school?
		First Professor Octavius almost blows up
		the Physics lab... Now this. You report
		it in triplicate, of course.

				ROZ
		Thorkel, be careful when you talk to
		Octavius. Remember... the man is a very
		fragile genius. One day he'll bring us
		all the Noble Prize.

				THORKEL
		Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous
		crackpot!

	Off screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to
	build.

				ROZ
		That's him again. He's working day and
		night.

				THORKEL
		I tell you the man is very dangerous.
			(the whine grows louder)
		Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before
		this building will explode.

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK and WEINER are at work as before. OCK takes no notice
	of the TWO MEN who come in, nor the WORKER who comes in
	behind them and sets to work attaching a BIG LOCK to the
	door.

				THORKEL
		Shut it down, Octavius.

	OCK ignores him. WEINER touches OCK'S shoulder. OCK
	ignores him too.

				THORKEL
		You've blown half the circuits in the
		Science Center.

				OCK
		Call an electrician.

				THORKEL
		I have called the locksmith.

				OCK
		What... what is he doing.

	He points toward the worker who's working on the lock on
	the main door.

				THORKEL
		We have to shut your lab down and take a
		look at the lines.

				ROZ
		Please, Otto, we must lock it up.

				OCK
			(to Thorkel)
		You're denying me access to my cyclotron?!

				THORKEL
		You bet.

	OCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN, the WORKER,
	and WEINER. Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE.

	The WHINE descends.

	The WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel. The
	WHINE dies.

				OCK
			(contemplating)
		Okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow.
		I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow...
		Ha... Tomorrow you can have this room...

				ROZ
		Oh... well Thorkel... few more hours
		won't make a difference.

				THORKEL
		I hope.

	He signals to the worker to stop.

	INT. APARTMENT OF AUNT MAY AND UNCLE BEN - NIGHT

	The N.Y. Mets are playing baseball on T.V. PETER watches
	with his UNCLE BEN, a paunchy 65 years old in POLYESTER
	SLACKS and a COMFY OLD SWEATER. A N.Y. METS CAP is
	perched on BEN'S head. A BEER CAN is in his hand. A
	cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably
	around them.

				BEN
		Another brewski?

				PETER
		No, I'm fine, Uncle Ben.

				BEN
			(at T.V.)
		Yah! Way to do it. Alright!
			(to Peter)
		You don't follow the Mets like you used
		to, do you, Pete?

				PETER
		No, not so much anymore.

				BEN
		Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed
		away... I had this idea... I wanted you
		to be the best baseball player that ever
		was. Geez, what ever happened to that?

				PETER
		Little league.

				BEN
			(soft and warm)
		Yeah... Babe Ruth you wasn't.

	AUNT MAY enters.

				AUNT MAY
		It's on the table! Turn off the TV!

	BEN nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound
	off only. PETER moves toward his AUNT in the doorway.

				AUNT MAY
		How's that girl you told us about, Peter?

				PETER
		Liz? She's great... But she has a
		boyfriend.

	INT. THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	PETER passes AUNT MAY and takes his seat.

				AUNT MAY
		A boy your age should have a girlfriend.

				PETER
		Aunt May... she has a steady boyfriend.

				AUNT MAY
		Peter, any girl that's worth your
		attention is of course gonna have a
		boyfriend... But if she really gets to
		know what you have to offer she'll... you
		get my drift?

				BEN
		Look, just leave him alone, okay. When
		he's ready for girls he'll be a holy
		terror.
			(winks)
		It's in the blood.
			(now serious business)
		Lookit, how are you fixed for money,
		Pete? Maybe I can help you out a little.

				PETER
			(lying to them)
		No, I'm alright. My scholarship covers
		almost everything, and I sell some photos
		here and there. Today my physics
		professor asked for some of my work... he
		wants to study my data. They might
		publish my work in the science magazine...
		that'll bring me some money...

				BEN
			(practically cheering)
		Publish your work?! You hear that May...?

				PETER
			(embarrassed laughs)
		Yeah, in fact I have to leave a little
		early tonight, to meet Professor
		Octavius... He offered me to be his
		assistant...

				BEN
		Whoa! Did you hear that May...?

				AUNT MAY
		Oh, Peter, you promised you'd spend the
		night...

				PETER
		I... I can't, Aunt May. Professor
		Octavius wants to discuss my new
		findings.

				AUNT MAY
			(disappointed)
		Peter, what you should be finding... is a
		nice girlfriend.

	INT. BASEMENT CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	WEINER is eating a large SANDWICH and a drinking a COKE.

				OCK
		I'll show them... closing the cyclotron
		on me... Weiner!

				WEINER
		Yes, Professor...

				OCK
		Where is he? It's ten past eight o'clock...

	A KNOCK

				WEINER
			(with mouth full)
		That must be him.
		He opens the door.

				PETER
		Good evening.

				OCK
		You are late.
			(to Weiner)
		Weiner, go outside and get us something
		to eat. And don't steal it! Just buy it.
		I'll reimburse you.

				WEINER
			(to Peter)
		Do you want anything Parker?

				PETER
		No thank you, I just had dinner at my
		aunt's...

				OCK
		Piss off, Weiner!

	WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around.

	He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the
	SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open
	WINDOW... and into the chamber.

				OCK
		Okey, dokey, Parker... how would you like
		to take Weiner's place... I mean, be my
		assistant?

				PETER
		Well, Professor, that would be a great
		honor, but I'm already working with...

				OCK
		Rosomorf... that imbecile. Don't you
		understand, kid, that I am about to
		uncover the greatest discovery since
		Einstein came up with his theory of
		relativity... The "Anti-Force."

				PETER
		Wow! The theory of the Anti-force! You
		should go for the Noble Prize Professor...

				OCK
		Noble Shmoble, I am going for a much
		bigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me
		show you, kid, what I got here.

	OCK begins the experiment. We move in past the shattered
	WINDOW. We see the SPIDER crawling on the chamber's GEAR.

				OCK
		Present maximum anti-force power to date
		is 38 percent of theoretical limit. I
		have patched in the variable
		particle-wave accelerator...
			(shrugs)
		I will now try to reach 50% power...
			(big breath)
		And if your paper has any value... I can
		use it to get the power I'm missing to
		create the anti-force, to break through
		and beat any other form of power in our
		or any other universe, capish!

				PETER
		Sorry, Professor, I can't do it. I gave
		my word to Professor Rosomorf.

	OCK is angry... Ock now sees the SPIDER. He shoots out a
	WALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast. The
	WALDO slams against the wall of the chamber. He starts to
	push every button or switch in sight. A deafening whining
	starts.

	An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the "Relative
	Gravity" DIAL. It is at "4.999999KG" but suddenly the
	numbers start to tumble rapidly.

	INSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT.
	INSERT: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER!

				OCK
			(screaming)
		50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent...
		that's all I'm missing! Parker, we can
		be rich together!

				PETER
		Sorry... I'd better go now.

				OCK
			(really angry now)
		You'll be sorry, Parker.

	PETER leaves.

	Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the
	monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word,
	"OVERLOAD!" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward!
	The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Incredibly lit, the SPIDER is dropping on it's shimmering
	WEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in
	time with the THROB and PULSE.

	INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The MONITOR is flashing "MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN!"
	OCK continues with the experiment. And then he sees the
	SPIDER!

				OCK
		You! Get out of there, you creeping...

	He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Through the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the
	other side if the shattered WINDOW. He sends TWO WALDOS
	after the SPIDER. The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto
	the PROFESSOR's back. It then climbs onto the PROFESSOR's
	neck and bites him.

				OCK
			(anguish)
		Noooooooooooo!

	The gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as
	OCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode
	or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which
	erupts like the 4th of JULY.

	OCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A
	DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a
	Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like
	snakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES!
	OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is
	pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with
	SPARKS.

				OCK
			(ecstasy above the din)
		It's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey!

	We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck.
	The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions,
	valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where
	they twitch and writhe with a life of their own.

	Then, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the
	CYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO-
	STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Ultimate weirdness! The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT
	penetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then
	the very walls! LOCKERS bang, LAMPS POP, the ceiling sags
	in a SURREAL, RUBBERY way.

	The WALLS sag too! The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds
	itself in a WALL. A LADDER sinks in the WALL. The BLUE-
	WHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES. Then,
	suddenly, it stops... DEAD SILENCE. WEINER comes running
	in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of
	Pepsi. Weiner enters OCK'S lab, singing, not at first
	noticing what's going on. Suddenly he stops dead.

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	A scene out of DALI's surrealistic canvas. There are
	things inside of other things. DIALS look like DALI
	watches. This place has been rippled to the max!
	OCK lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a WALDO across
	his chest. The SPIDER is weaving its web. CAMERA slowly
	DOWN to see OCK. PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body.
	The WALDO seems to be wrapping him. He wakes up to see
	those MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body. They weave
	around him as if they are looking for prey. He tries to
	tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body,
	like his other limbs. He screams. Suddenly Weiner sees
	OCK.

				WEINER
		Professor... what happened to you? What
		did you do...

	Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he
	flies back and out through the door to the corridor.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

				WEINER
		Oh my God... what happened here...

	He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away.

				WEINER
		I better get out of here.

	EXT. THE EMPIRE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	The long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN. A COP CAR pulls
	to a halt in front of the COLLEGE. Many NYPD CARS are
	already there, along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN, some
	AMBULANCES, a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
	and TWO TV VANS. ROZ runs across the lawn.

	POLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press, students
	and general gawkers.

	J. JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see
	TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it.
	The MAN shakes his head. JAMESON throws down his CIGAR,
	stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. THORKEL arrives to
	address the CROWD.

				THORKEL
			(through bull horn)
		There is no danger. Please go back to
		your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger.

				JAMESON
			(approaches him)
		Spill it out, Professor! The public
		wants to know!

	The CROWD closes on THORKEL.

				THORKEL
		Who are you?

				JAMESON
		Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now
		what really happened here?

				THORKEL
		There will be a press announcement in the
		morning Mr. Jameson... now if you'll
		excuse me.

	This elicits a flood of AD LIBS: "I heard a terrible
	explosion?" "Nuclear accidents?" "Meltdown?" "Genetic
	engineering?" "Are you guys making mutants in there?"

				THORKEL
		I have nothing to say... there will be an
		announcement. Now, please go home...
		everybody... we must clear the grounds...

	In the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and
	KIM.

				FLASH
		You think they'll cancel classes?

				HARRY
		They must... the whole building must be
		contaminated with some kind of poisonous
		gas.

				PETER
		How about nuclear contaminations?

				KIM
		My God... lets beat it.
		But nobody moves.

				LIZ
			(more interested in other
			things)
		Could anyone be in there, Peter?

				PETER
			(concerned)
		I don't know... Maybe Professor Octavius.
		He usually works late...

				FLASH
		That nut, I bet it was all his doing...

				JAMESON
			(seeing Peter)
		Hey Parker! Peter Parker!

	PETER pushes forward.

				PETER
		Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here?
		What's going on?

				JAMESON
		That's for them to know, and for you to
		find out.

				PETER
		But sir, they wouldn't tell us. You
		heard Thorkel... he said...

				JAMESON
		A press announcement tomorrow...! But we
		must know tonight Parker. This is your
		university, right...

				PETER
		Yes, but...

				JAMESON
		You got your camera?

				PETER
		Sure, but I can't--

				JAMESON
		A hundred dollars says you can?

				PETER
		Yes sir!

				JAMESON
		Get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks.

				PETER
		You just said a hundred.

				JAMESON
		Seventy, but I want blood and gore.

				PETER
			(calling back)
		Seeya guys.

	He dashes off. FLASH shakes his head in dismay at this
	guy.

				LIZ
		Where is he going?

				JAMESON
		To make fifty bucks.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	PETER approaches a CYCLONE FENCE keeping low and out of
	sight. He leaps it like a skirmisher but fails
	ignominiously in a heap. He's torn his PANTS and cut his
	leg. He moves to the side of the building.

	A DUMPSTER sits next to a FIRE DOOR. It's locked. As
	PETER mulls over his next move, the LOCK clicks and the
	DOOR slowly opens. PETER leaps on the DUMPSTER... and
	falls in.

	INT. DUMPSTER - NIGHT

	PETER lays in the GARBAGE, a pained look on his face. He
	rolls over and comes face to face with a wet DAILY BUGLE.
	The headline reads, "Wave of Violence Rips City!" He pulls
	himself up and peers out.

	He sees a UNIFORMED GUARD hold the DOOR open for THREE MEN
	IN RADIATION SUITS who remove some weirdly fused objects.
	When they let the DOOR swing closed, PETER stops it by
	inserting the NEWSPAPER in the top.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	PETER squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the
	NEWSPAPER. The Door closes behind him.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Skewed, strange, surreal, PETER stares at the weirdness
	and fumbles with his CAMERA. He snaps off a few shots,
	then freezes when he hears a familiar voice.

				ROZ (V.O.)
			(filtered through face mask)
		Take it easy. Take it easy with him.

				THORKEL (V.O.)
		Take him away and never bring him back!

	Now we see ROZ and THORKEL following 2 GUARDS carrying OCK
	in a stretcher. They all wear RADIATION SUITS. A waldo
	sneaks out from under the sheet and hits Thorkel, as fast
	as lightning. He falls back. He's covered with a SHEET
	and attached to LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. Octavius moans.

				THORKEL
		What was that?

				ROZ
		What was what?

				THORKEL
		What hit me?

				ROZ
		What hit you?

				THORKEL
		I don't know. It was so fast.

				ROZ
		You're going to be fine, Otto.

	PETER gets off a shot and ducks into the MEN'S room
	leaving the DOOR ajar for a peak.

	A WALDO slips down from the SHEET. PETER'S eyes go wide
	at the sight. What in the hell has happened here?

	INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The URINALS are twisted in bizarre shapes. PIPES are
	exposed and spout WATER. The MIRRORS look like something
	out of a funhouse. PETER hears the STRETCHER go by.
	PETER goes to the DOOR of OCK'S Lab and cracks it. PAN up
	to the SPIDER, GLOWING softly, dangling from a SHIMMERING
	STRAND above PETER.

	As PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on
	his neck. He reacts by swatting it away. Bad move.
	The GLOWING SPIDER now squats malevolently on the back of
	PETER's hand. He stares at it transfixed. It bites.

				PETER
		Ow!!!

	PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it
	scuttles unsteadily out the door.

	Sweat starts to bead on PETER'S face. He shakes his head
	to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches
	against a WEIRD SINK.

	PETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not
	just moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that!

				GUARD (V.O.)
			(heavily distorted)
		Hey! What are you doing here, kid?

	PETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his
	crazy vision.

				PETER
		I feel a little funny...

				GUARD
			(heavily distorted)
		Yeah? Well, I ain't laughing. Get out...
		Just get out of here...

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	It bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws
	his BACK PACK at him.

				GUARD
			(still distorted)
		You get yourself over to the Police lines.

				PETER
			(ultra wooz)
		Right. Police lines.

	EXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	PETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON
	appears at his side.

				JAMESON
			(distorted)
		Okay, scoop, whaddaya got?

				PETER
		I... got pictures of the Professor... in
		there... it's so strange in there... so
		bizarre...

				JAMESON
			(winks)
		Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need.
		Pick this up in the morning.
			(holding up his camera)
		There'll be two crisp twenties tucked
		inside.

	He hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden
	his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is
	gone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to
	the street.

	We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind
	him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN.

	An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits
	PETER who leaps to avoid it.

	EXT. BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT

	PETER'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his
	eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the
	building like a spider. And he's three stories up!
	He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him!
	And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away.
	He tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and
	crashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And
	then another.

	Tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he
	"crawls" to the roof of the building. At the top he
	gropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories
	above the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the
	roof one-handed.

	EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

	PETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits
	up and looks wonderingly at his hands.

	On the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS
	surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW
	disappears.

				PETER
			(mutters to himself)
		This is weird. My God, I feel so weird...

	He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good
	Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of
	"jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the
	air!

				PETER
			(exhilarated)
		Very weird.

	The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as
	PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air.
	With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps
	from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL
	where he lands sideways and sticks.

				PETER
			(sideways)
		Very, very weird.

	He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof.
	He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a
	step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.

	EXT. ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT

	PETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and
	across the street. PETER bites his lip.

				PETER
		Well, what the hell!!

	EXT. THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT

	Backlit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of
	the taller building, and misses the top!

	He sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs
	with the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty
	BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way
	and that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT
	down the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws
	into the room.

	EXT. CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT

	The MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST
	and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED
	LIGHTER.

	In the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off
	the taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time
	to see PETER make it to the next FACADE.

	EXT. ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT

	With the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to
	the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop.

	Watching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT
	follows PETER'S progress.

	PETER leaps to a BROWNSTONE and lands amid the WASH.
	He leaps up to a TENEMENT and lands on a BILLBOARD across
	which he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again.

	He touches down on a PIGEON COOP and bounds up and out of
	frame again. The COOP OWNER, a LATINO in an undershirt
	and a YANKEES CAP, comes running out of the COOP.

	He's so surprised that he leaves the DOOR open and twenty
	WHITE MORNING DOVES fly away in a furious flapping, free
	at last. The LATINO lets out a stream of Hispanic
	expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene
	gestures.

	PETER slides down a CABLE to a LAMP POST, and swirls down
	the POLE to a PHONE BOOTH.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

	PETER comes face to face with the man in the LOUD
	SPORTCOAT. He gives PETER his CARD.

				REISS
		You're a kid who's going places, and I'm
		gonna point you the right way.

				PETER
			(reading card)
		Max Reiss, models, strip dancers, escort
		girls, blue movies...

				REISS
		Oops... sorry, wrong card.
			(exchanges cards)

				PETER
		Max Reiss, Talent management.

				REISS
		It's a big outfit. Got a lot of
		departments.

				PETER
		Yeah... well... why you approach me? I'm
		not...

				REISS
		Oh yes you are... very talented. The
		three questions of show business success.
		One do you think you possess a unique
		talent?

				PETER
		Well...

				REISS
		Two... what are you gonna do with it?

				PETER
			(not a clue)
		Well... I don't know.

				REISS
			(the clincher)
		Three... how much money you got in your
		pocket?

				PETER
		Ten.

				REISS
		You invest half of that with me and I'll
		make you a star.

				PETER
			(laughing)
		What are you talking about?

				REISS
		I'm talking about fame. I'm talking
		about fortune. I'm talking about the
		chance of a lifetime. How'd you like to
		be on MTV tomorrow night?

				PETER
		MTV...? Me? Really?

				REISS
		Taxi!

	It screeches to a stop.

				PETER
		Hey!

				REISS
			(getting in)
		Kid! Tomorrow night. Same place, same
		time.

				PETER
			(calling after)
		How do you know I'll show up?

	As the TAXI roars off...

				REISS
			(from the taxi window)
		Because you wanna be a star... everybody
		does.

	PETER pulls out a QUARTER. And enters a phone booth. He
	dials.

				PETER
		Hello? Aunt May?

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)
			(filtered)
		Peter? What time is it? Are you alright?

				PETER
		Well, no, I mean yeah I'm fine, but
		listen... Aunti, the craziest thing
		happened to me tonight.

	INT./ EXT. PHONE BOOTH/AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As UNCLE BEN stirs fitfully

				AUNT MAY
			(lovingly)
		Does this have to do with a certain girl
		we talked about at dinner?

				PETER
		No, no, look, there was this radioactive
		experiment... I was poisoned!

				AUNT MAY
		You were what?

				PETER
		I was bitten by a bug.

				AUNT MAY
		Oh! I get it, you mean a love bug.

				PETER
		No... No... A spider...

				AUNT MAY
		Peter, did you at least talk to her?

				PETER
		Aunt May, listen to me. I got bitten on
		the hand... by a poisonous spider.

				AUNT MAY
		She bit you?

				PETER
		No. I was in the bathroom and...

				AUNT MAY
		Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter,
		this is craziness, why don't you use your
		bed? You're up all night. You're in the
		radioactive labs. You never take time to
		eat or sleep. Am I right?

				PETER
		Yes, Aunt May.

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)
		Did you eat something today?

				PETER
		Yes, Aunt May.

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)
		Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember
		we love you.

				PETER
		And I love you too, Aunt May.
			(hangs up)
		And by the way, I got a mess of super
		powers today.

	Exit booth. He BANGS the PHONE BOOTH. Goes out and--
	jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof.

	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK is prepped for surgery. GOWNED PERSONNEL hurry about
	with a feverish urgency. The CHIEF SURGEON checks the
	SENSORS attached to OCK'S head. These seasoned
	professionals are astonished and frightened.

				CHIEF SURGEON
			(whispers)
		Look at these brainwave readings. The
		mental activity is ten times of any
		normal man...!

				BRAINMAN
			(whispers)
		Equipment malfunction...?

				CHIEF SURGEON
			(whispers)
		Hell, yeah... his.
			(checks Ock's chest)
		My God... I thought I'd seen everything...

				SURGEON #2
			(whispers)
		But this is beyond medicine. This is
		madness...!

	OCK lays bare chested, face up, all FOUR WALDOS splayed.
	He is a true cyborg. Part man, part machine. Part
	organic, part molybdenum steel.

				NURSE
			(leaning in, blitzed)
		It is so freaky...

				CHIEF SURGEON
			(stern for the staff's
			sake)
		Okay, lets stop yakking and get cracking.
		I want to go in at the upper thoracic.
		Then we'll work our way around.
			(slaps Ock's shoulder)
		Hang in there, man.

	INSERT: The WALDO nearest the slap moves ever so slightly.
	The triangular CLAW rotates a quarter turn and then turns
	back.

	The NURSE sees it and SCREAMS.

				CHIEF SURGEON
			(glares)
		Nurse! Number seven scalpel.
		Arthroscope stand by. Read out
		parameters in progress. Let's go in.
		You alright?

				NURSE
		Yes... Yes, of course. Everything's
		online.

				CHIEF SURGEON
		Scalpel! No... no... a larger one...
		the largest we have!

	She slaps a HUGE ONE into his palm. He takes a deep
	breath and goes to work. MASKED heads gather round him.
	The SCALPEL is poised at the line where skin meets steel.
	We make an incision. The INSTRUMENTS go crazy. WARNING
	BELLS and BUZZERS sound.

				HEAD NURSE
		Kill the alarms!

				BRAINMAN
		He's going off the chart!

	A WALDO flashes around the steel leg of the operating
	TABLE and clanks tight!

				CHIEF SURGEON
		Mop. Mop! Sutures and clamps! Hurry up!

				SURGEON #2
		We're losing him. Defibrillate!

	A HEART MACHINE is rushed in. They work frantically.

				CHIEF SURGEON
		Zap him!

				BRAINMAN
		Stabilizing alpha waves...

	SURGEON #2 applies the CARDIAC SHOCK PADS.

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

				NURSE
		You have a visitor, Doctor...

	She leaves OCK and THORKEL alone.

				THORKEL
			(enjoying this)
		Octavius, I'm afraid I have bad news for
		you.

				OCK
		The cyclotron is damaged...

				THORKEL
		What used to be the cyclotron was
		permanently shut down this afternoon.

				OCK
		But my work!

				THORKEL
		Your work is a disaster! Look at
		yourself!

				OCK
		Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters
		anymore. To enter a new dimension we
		must first destroy our own...

				THORKEL
		What are you saying?

	OCK gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with
	his 4 WALDOS and 2 arms.

				OCK
		Destroy life. Life is... insignificant.
		Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What
		would you say?

				THORKEL
		Oh, my God, what are those horrible
		things sticking from your body?

				OCK
			(gets more and more excited)
		Thorkel, if I told you that for one
		moment in time I broke all the laws! For
		one brief glorious moment, I broke
		through to the other side. I saw... I
		felt... I became creation.

				THORKEL
		What on Earth are you rambling about?

				OCK
		Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so
		clearly now. Universal destruction, yes.
		All I need is the power... then I can
		destroy this illusion you call life. It
		is my destiny to lead us to the light!

				THORKEL
		You're a madman.

				OCK
		And you are a fool. I will end the
		universe as you know it. And in that
		final moment... I'll laugh my ass off
		while you're kissing yours goodbye!

				THORKEL
			(excited)
		Goodbye is right, Octavius... You're
		fired... sacked... canned. You are
		history, Doctor Octavius. And I couldn't
		be more pleased to be the first to tell
		you this good news...

	A WALDO shoots up and grabs THORKEL by the throat. He
	GASPS and SCREAMS silently as the telescoping WALDO lifts
	him off his feet. He rises until his head is just inches
	from the ceiling.

				THORKEL
			(his last words)
		Let me down Ock... you crazy... MONSTER!
		Let me down!

	Then OCK smiles and slams THORKEL'S head through the
	ceiling. PLASTER rains down. THORKEL'S legs scissor and
	kick and then go limp. OCK throws his dead body on to the
	bed, and covers him with the WHITE SHEETS.

				OCK
		Okey, dokey.

	INT. TAXI - NIGHT

	Through the WINDOW of the TAXI we see MADISON SQUARE
	GARDEN.

	As it pulls up, a sign reads, "Midnight Madness! MTV's
	Rock and Wrestling 'SLAMMY Awards!" The TAXI come to a
	stop.

				PETER
			(looking up at the sign)
		MTV Wrestling?!

				REISS
			(getting out)
		That's the place. Pay the man.

	MAX REISS gets out, he is carrying a BOX.

				PETER
		Look, Mr. Reiss... I'm not real
		interested in watching a wrestling match.

				REISS
		Who said anything about watching a
		wrestling match? You're here to win a
		wrestling match!

				PETER
		Me? You must be kidding.

	REISS hustles PETER inside.

				REISS
		You hop around. You know, the way you
		did last night. Your opponent gets tired.
		He falls down. The ref counts to three,
		you win, and we pick up a thousand bucks.

	INT. CATACOMBS MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

	We can hear the CROWD screaming at something in the
	background as REISS leads PETER to an employee WASHROOM
	and shows him the BOX.

				REISS
		You're really gonna love this.

				PETER
		Look, really, I don't know...

				REISS
		You don't have to know. I know enough
		for both of us.
			(pause)
		Change in there.

				PETER
		What is this?

				REISS
		A costume... something that fits your
		talent. Go put it on. I'm sure you'll
		like it.

	He slaps the BOX against PETER'S chest and all but pushes
	him inside.

	INT. WASHROOM - NIGHT

	PETER takes the suit out of the BOX. It is the SPIDER-MAN
	SUIT! He looks at it and shrugs. Then he begins to
	struggle into it.

	PETER is looking at himself in the MIRROR. He is dressed
	in all but the MASK. And he looks terrific! He flexes.
	He smoothes his hair. He's starting to get into it.

	INT. THE ARENA - NIGHT

	CRUSHER COLE is destroying an opponent.

	INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

	REISS winces as the CROWD CHEERS and BOOS.

				PETER
			(comes out)
		How does it look? I feel like it's
		Halloween.

				REISS
		Cover your face with the mask.

				PETER
		Why?

				REISS
		Mystery, my friend. Nobody should know
		who you are...

	INT. THE RING - NIGHT

	CRUSHER COLE is doing a big flexing number and the CROWD
	is going wild. There are MTV CAMERAS and SIGNS and
	BANNERS proclaiming the "SLAMMIES" everywhere.

				RING ANNOUNCER
		And now, a new challenger, for the
		thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one
		hundred and fifty pounds... from parts
		unknown! Here is the Amazing...
		Mysterious... Incredible Superman...

				REISS
			(snorts from ringside,
			hating the name)
		No, not Superman... Spider-Man...
		SPIDER-MAN!!!

				RING ANNOUNCER
		...Spider-Man!!!!!

	The CROWD BOOS the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly
	through the ropes. Rock music blares. TWIN REDHEADS in
	RED BIKINIS ring a bell.

	CRUSHER COLE and SPIDER-MAN circle. COLE is twice
	SPIDEY'S size. SPIDEY spots a TV CAMERA for the first
	time. He momentarily freezes. CRUSHER sneers the CRUSHER
	sneer. Then he charges!

	With the agility of a spider, SPIDEY leaps out of the way.
	CRUSHER comes back at him. SPIDEY leaps again, bigger!
	The acrobatics get more and more dramatic as CRUSHER COLE
	works himself up into a theatrical rage. Taunts erupt
	from the CROWD.

				OLD LADY
		Kill the sucker, Crusher!

	SPIDEY, really getting into it now, begins playing for the
	CAMERAS.

				HIPSTER
			(between two blondes)
		Whatsamatter, Crusher, can't you crush
		that bug?

				CRUSHER
			(to Spidey)
		Okay, Web Face, this is it!

	He misses SPIDEY again!

				HIPSTER
		Hey, Crusher, you need a insecticide!
			(his blondes titter)

	INT. LIZ/KIM'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

	LIZ'S side is all schoolwork. KIM'S side is all ROCK
	POSTERS and STUFFED ANIMALS. LIZ is curled up doing
	homework. FLASH and KIM sit on the edge of the bed
	watching the "SLAMMIES" on MTV.

				FLASH
		Will you look at this Spider-Man guy! He
		is absolutely incredible!

				KIM
		Liz, get a load of this outfit! I wish I
		had it for the Halloween party... it's
		quite sexy.

				LIZ
		Will you two shush. I'm trying to work.

	INT. RING - NIGHT

	The match continues in an increasingly spectacular
	choreography. CRUSHER bellows at the SCREAMING CROWD.
	But there's a gleam in his eye. This is it!
	He charges. SPIDEY, playing the CAMERAS for all he's
	worth, leaps way, way up. But this time CRUSHER stops
	dead in his tracks. SPIDER-MAN comes back down into a
	forearm SMASH that sends him reeling into a corner.
	CRUSHER does a flying pin. 300 pounds. WOMP! The air
	leaves SPIDEY in a rush as CRUSHER covers him, smothering
	him. The CROWD goes WILD.

				REF
		One...!

				REISS
		Get up...! Get up...!

				REF
		Two...!

	Not realizing his own strength and panicky about being
	squashed, SPIDER-MAN throws CRUSHER COLE off him and up
	into the air. Way up! Reiss cheers... Spider-Man comes
	down and knocks CRUSHER for the first time.

	CRUSHER flies away and out of the arena, eight rows back!
	The HIPSTER sees CRUSHER coming at him and bolts from his
	seat. CRUSHER lands on it, in between the TWO BLONDES who
	break into utter hysterics.

	SPIDEY, surprised at his own strength, watches CRUSHER
	land.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(whispers to himself)
		Wow...

				REF
		Ladies and Gentlemen, history is made
		today, we have here the first man to win
		a thousand dollars against the mighty
		Crusher.

	The REF raises his hand in victory. The CROWD BOOS and
	DEBRIS rains down. But some in the CROWD CHEER wildly,
	recognizing the new sensation.

	SPIDER-MAN steps down from the right as REISS leads the
	CHEERS.

				PETER
		Max! Am I really gonna get a thousand...

				REISS
		We are going to get a thousand--

	PETER turns with REISS and comes face to face with CRUSHER
	COLE. Two ominous beats.

				CRUSHER
		Hi, who are you, kid?

				PETER
		I'm Peter Parker.

				REISS
		He is Spider-Man, and I handle him...
		Whenever you want a rematch call me.
		Next time it's gonna be ten thousand,
		what do you say... Crusher?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I'm really sorry
		about what happened in there. Really...

				CRUSHER
		Oh, well, I don't know what happened to
		me tonight...
			(measures his muscles)
		I really don't know...

				REISS
		I know... you lost. Big man you lost to
		the Amazing Spider-Man.

	EXT. CITY STREET - NEAR A HOSPITAL - DAY

	WE ARE TIGHT ON A NEW YORK JOURNAL TRUCK. On its SIDE
	BANNER is a PICTURE of SPIDER-MAN'S face. Headline: "Who
	is he? Mega-Smash Hits MTV!"

	The TRUCK pulls away and we see PETER, LIZ, HARRY and KIM
	standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. PETER is
	rocking on his heels and smirking.

				PETER
			(indicating truck)
		You know who that is?

				LIZ
			(walking ahead)
		Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last
		night... boy does Flash think he's hot.

				PETER
		He does...

				KIM
		I love wrestling.

				HARRY
		Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really
		believe this little guy in a stupid
		Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher?

				LIZ
		Hey, we better rush... visiting hours
		will be over soon.

	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR & ROOM - DAY

	The NURSE leads PETER and LIZ and HARRY into the room.

				NURSE
		Doctor Octavius? You have visitors.
		Doctor Octavius?

	We hold for a beat. When LIZ takes a step forward to look
	around we expect the worst. But nothing grabs her.
	PETER sees a pile of PLASTER on the floor. He looks up
	and sees the hole in the ceiling. LIZ and HARRY look up
	too. OCK is not there.

				PETER
		Ock is not here!

				LIZ
		My God, what happened?

				NURSE
		I'd better call the doctor!

				HARRY
		You'd better call the police!

	KIM screams.

	INT. CORRIDOR TO OCK'S LAB - DAY

	OCK, hiding his WALDOS under a white hospital robe. He
	stalls until he reaches the door. Then one of his WALDOS
	peaks out and snaps open the new locks on the door.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK, in a white hospital robe walks through the surreal
	debris. Two WALDOS reach out and "sense" the ripples on
	opposite WALLS. He runs a hand through his hair.

				OCK
		What a wreck. What a useless, wasted
		wreck. Okey, dokey. We rebuild you, my
		damaged darling. Bigger, better, hotter!
		A world class, super cyclotron!

	He hears a NOISE behind him and reacts. And here comes
	WEINER. Bedraggled, shuffling through the CONTROL ROOM
	door. He eyeballs the incredible wreckage.

				WEINER
		There you are, doc... where have you
		been... whoa this place is messed up.

	OCK turns, WALDOS writhing. WEINER sees them and kind of
	ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once.

				WEINER
			(smirks)
		Whoa, doc! You look a little messed up
		yourself.

				OCK
		Where have you been, you imbecile?

				WEINER
		I went to the wrestling...

				OCK
		Wrestling...

				WEINER
		I went after the kid. You still want
		that Parker guy's data, don't you?

				OCK
		Well, did you get it?

				WEINER
		No, I followed him... but I lost him in
		the crowd.

				OCK
		Lost him? You--

				WEINER
		I'll find him, Maestro... I promise...
		soon... maybe by tomorrow.

				OCK
		So how was the wrestling?

				WEINER
		Fantastic! There was this new wrestler...
		beat the mighty Crusher. You won't
		believe it... a nothing of a guy... calls
		himself this stupid name... the Amazing
		Spider-Man... would you believe it?

				OCK
		Spider-Man, huh? Well, maybe I'll just
		go and wrestle myself one of these days...
		with all my new arms... I'm sure I can
		beat Crusher or any other monster.

	Suddenly OCK throws out his WALDOS from under his long
	white coat, grabs WEINER and, lifts him up in the air,
	smiles cynically and with cruelty!

				OCK
		Will I beat him, this Crusher, will I
		beat him or not?

				WEINER
		No... no, please... I mean yes, yes...
		you'll beat him easily... let me down...
		Please... I'll do anything for you...

				OCK
		The Parker data... get me the Parker
		data, you hear?!!!

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOFTOP - DAY

	A CAMERA is mounted on a TRIPOD facing us. A TIMER winds
	down and it CLICKS.

	REVERSE ANGLE - CAMERA'S POV.
	SPIDER-MAN is clinging to the side of a WALL.

				SPIDER-MAN
		And one like this...
			(changing pose)
		And one looking real sincere.

	The WHITE EYES narrow to a slit. CLICK.
	Suddenly he spots WEINER climbing onto his roof. He
	hides.

	WEINER tiptoes into the roof apartment. SPIDER-MAN jumps
	in and grabs him.

				SPIDER-MAN
		What are you doing here?

				WEINER
		I'm looking for Peter Parker.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Oh, yes... so why not use the front door?

	SPIDER-MAN throws him back onto the roof so that he almost
	slides over the edge. WEINER turns, facing SPIDER-MAN.

				WEINER
		Hey, I know you...

				SPIDER-MAN
		You do?

				WEINER
		I saw you crushing the Crusher.

				SPIDER-MAN
		You like wrestling?

	SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER.

				WEINER
		I love it! You are the best wrestler I
		have ever seen... please don't hurt me!

	SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna
	above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately.
	SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna.

				WEINER
		Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help
		me down.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Of course I'll help you down. I am
		Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not?

				WEINER
		Yes... yes, you are.

	SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his
	arms and whispers to him.

				SPIDER-MAN
		And by the way, Peter Parker does not
		live here anymore...

	SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of
	the roof.

				SPIDER-MAN
		And tell the Professor he can't have
		Peter's data. Goodbye.

	SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors
	straight down into heavy bushes below.

	INT. ELECTRODYNE FACTORY SHOP - DAY

	A SIGN tells us so. A CLERK is double checking a long
	list of items OCK has ordered.

	CLERK
	Holy cow, whattaya building, fella, a

		accelerator rails, a half dozen... a GBC

		Cash! I'll be back soon.

	EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE OF A BANK - BACK DOOR - NIGHT

	An ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the
	Bank's DOORS.

	Suddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW
	of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER'S NECK
	and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for
	his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out
	through his WINDOW.

	TWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR
	DOOR.

				BANK GUARD
		What's going on here?

	The WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The
	TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS.

				OCK
		Cash!

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY

	A PHOTO ASSISTANT look on as JAMESON goes over PETER'S
	latest PHOTOS. They are his SPIDER-MAN shots.

				PETER
		Doesn't he look amazing in that one?
		Look, he's flying in the air!

				JAMESON
		I don't care if he flies to the moon.
		He's just another wrestler in a silly
		costume. Look at this, Parker, right off
		the wire. This is the guy who hit that
		armored truck this morning. They say he
		has metal arms... get me a picture of
		this character!

				PETER
		Metal arms?

				JAMESON
		Four of them.

				PETER
		Ock...?!

				JAMESON
		The web faced weirdo... He is a joke in a
		Halloween costume... don't make me laugh.

	He tears up PETER'S SPIDEY PHOTOS.

				JAMESON
		Now get out of here and don't come back
		without something I can use!

				PETER
		Yes sir...
			(stops, and turns back)

				JAMESON
		A mega baloney... A bug in blue tights...
		what next?

				PETER
		The Journal said he was a mega-smash on
		MTV...

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	WEINER is putting on a CLOWN SUIT. He fastidiously puts
	his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a PIPE. The
	PIPE turns into a snake. It is, in fact, a WALDO!

				OCK
			(turning from work)
		What do you think you're doing?

				WEINER
		I'm going to the Masquerade. It's
		Halloween tonight Doc, aren't you coming
		to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go
		without an outfit.

	A WALDO whips around WEINER'S throat... AARRRGH!

				OCK
		You're not going to any ball, clown.
		You're going to get me Peter Parker's
		data...

				WEINER
		I was almost killed on my last try...
		Look at all these bruises...

				OCK
		I don't care if you come back dead. Just
		get it!

				WEINER
			(croaking)
		Cost you a thousand bucks, if I get it.

	The WALDO coils tighten around WEINER'S throat.

				WEINER
		All right... boss please let go...
		P L E A S E ...

				OCK
		Just get it, Weiner. I'm running out of
		time. If you fail me again, you won't
		have to concern yourself with money
		anymore... DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?!

	WEINER croaks his assent.

	INT. CAFETERIA - NIGHT

	It is all dressed up for a party: LIGHTS, STREAMERS,
	GLITTER BALL, the WORKS! HARRY is dressed as a SPACEMAN;
	PETER wears his regular clothes.

				HARRY
		You should have worn a costume. I told
		you to wear a costume.

				PETER
		It's... embarrassing.

				HARRY
		There's Liz...

	LIZ is crossing the dance floor dressed as an INDIAN
	PRINCESS in an MINI-DRESS.

				PETER
		Yeah...

	ROZ, dressed as a COWBOY, ambles over.

				ROZ
		... howdy partners.

				PETER/HARRY
		Hiya, Professor Rosomorf.

				HARRY
		Any word on Doctor Octavius?

				ROZ
			(falling in step)
		Nothing beyond what I read in the papers.
		I'm afraid he's not the same man we knew.
		You know, I've been digging through the
		notes on his experiments...

	PETER follows LIZ with his eyes. She takes a seat at a
	TABLE next to KIM who wears a HAREM GIRL outfit with the
	SALAMANDER around her neck. Next to KIM is... SPIDER-MAN!
	PETER'S eyes go wide.

				ROZ
		You boys must have had an extraordinary
		classroom experience.

				PETER
			(eyeing Spidey)
		Yes sir... oh... I'm going to be a little
		late with my paper on the Planetary
		Conjunction, sir...

				ROZ
		Whenever you're ready... I'll look at it.
		I know it's going to be an important
		work... and Peter, take my hat.

	He hands PETER an oversized TEN GALLON HAT.

				ROZ
		It is a costume party.

	PETER and HARRY make their way through the dance floor to
	the table. PETER can't take his eyes off SPIDEY.

				HARRY
		Look, there's Spider-Man!

				PETER
		Not the real one, I'm sure...

				HARRY
		You can never be sure... all kinds of
		crazy stuff can happen at a masquerade
		ball...

				PETER
		I bet I know who it is.

	As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying
	to read the BUGLE'S sports section by party light. KIM
	waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face.

				PETER
		Hiya, Liz...

	LIZ moves to Flash, who's dressed in the SPIDER-MAN
	costume.

				LIZ
		Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man
		costume?

				PETER
		It's a very clever outfit you've got
		there, Flash.

				FLASH
		Take a hike, asshole.

				LIZ
			(to Peter)
		How did you recognize him?

				PETER
		His pretty blue eyes give him away...

				HARRY
		Anyway, who'll be sitting with you at the
		Halloween Ball?

				LIZ
			(whispers to Flash)
		I wanna dance... Hey, Spider-Man... Shall
		we Flash dance?

				FLASH/SPIDER-MAN
		Hey, I'm reading the paper, okay?

	LIZ turns with a mild pout. Nervously, PETER ponders his
	chance. HARRY nudges him.

				HARRY
		Take her now, it's easy...

	HARRY turns to KIM and does a clanking shimmy in the SPACE
	SUIT.

				HARRY
		Wanna dance, Schechrezaa?

				KIM
		I'm pooped.

				LIZ
		I'm not...

	She reaches for HARRY'S hand.

				FLASH
		Holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at
		these pictures of Spider-Man? Wow! Is
		this guy great or what?

	LIZ looks. She shrugs. Then she shrieks.

				LIZ
		Hey, Peter! These are your pictures!

				FLASH
		Can't be...

				LIZ
		It says here "Photos by Peter Parker."

	PETER reacts, then looks over FLASH'S other shoulder.

	INSERT: There are three PHOTOS of SPIDER-MAN in the paper.
	PETER BLUSHES, smiling.

				FLASH
			(takes off his head mask)
		You know this guy, Parker?

				PETER
		Well, yeah... sort of...

				FLASH
		Wow... I'll give you anything if you
		introduce us.

				HARRY
			(to Liz)
		Will you grant me this dance...?

	LIZ joins him provocatively.

				KIM
		Hey, Flash-Man... Wanna dance...?

				FLASH
		Well, why not.

	PETER is left alone, PETER leaves toward the entrance.
	At the REAR DOOR a BIG LIZARD passes a NOTE to a DALLAS
	COWGIRL who passes it to a KANGAROO. The KANGAROO hops
	across the dance floor to the STAGE where he hands the
	NOTE to a YOUNG WOMAN in a BASEBALL UNIFORM.

	She climbs the STAGE where she is bathed in a SPOTLIGHT.
	She gets a DRUM ROLL from the band. There are some BOOS
	as the bad stops.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Thank you, thank you. We have a special
		surprise guest tonight.
			(booo)
		The Empire State University Masquerade
		Ball presents... The "Slammy" winning
		star of MTV'S wrestling tournament... The
		Amazing Spider-Man!

	FLASH, amazed turns to LIZ. He points to himself and
	mouths, "Me?" (The REAL) SPIDEY drops from the ceiling and
	lands in a pose. The CROWD cheers. He does a flip to LIZ
	and extends a hand. The BAND starts up. LIZ demurs.

				FLASH
			(whispers firmly)
		Go ahead... go ahead!

	LIZ takes SPIDEY'S hand and they move slowly and sexily
	onto the dance floor. They do a short simple number.
	SPIDEY returns LIZ to FLASH.

				LIZ
			(to Flash)
		Come on... Flash...

	FLASH takes LIZ from PETER (SPIDER-MAN).

	LIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers.
	The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd
	backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number
	in film history. He's all over the floor and on the walls
	and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ
	and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops
	in a pose. BIG CHEERS.

	LIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN'S face.

				LIZ
			(whispers breathless)
		Who are you...?

				PETER
		One day you'll know...

				LIZ
			(a long beat)
		You sound very familiar.

				PETER/SPIDER-MAN
		Sure I do... I'm your friendly
		neighborhood Spider-Man!

	He jumps away and disappears, leaving the CROWD aghast and
	LIZ in love.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN is flicking through the channels of his TV, aggravated
	as usual. It's all ROCK VIDEOS!

				BEN
			(to May)
		What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and
		roll's screwed up the whole TV.

	He flicks off the set and turns to MAY who's asleep on the
	couch. He gently nudges her.

		Come on, May. Wake up and go to sleep.

				CABBIE
		What'm I in, a race?

				SPIDER-MAN
			(fighting his fear)
		I don't know... I get this tingling in my
		brain, like some danger is lurking just
		ahead. I'm worried about Aunt May and
		Uncle Ben...

				CABBIE
		Your family?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Well, they are kind of my parents. They
		raised me. I lost both of my parents in
		a car accident... please step on it!

				CABBIE
		Step on it... so now you want to kill
		yourself in another accident... not with
		me, Boychick.

				SPIDER-MAN
		But I'm telling you... I've got this--

				CABBIE

		worry about.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(a beat)
		What kinda outfit is that, anyway?

				SPIDER-MAN
			(panicked)
		Look, I'm really in a hurry.

	BANG! A BLOW OUT. The CABBIE fights the wheel to the
	side of the road. Then he turns to SPIDEY.

				CABBIE
			(sly)
		You said the magic words, we have a flat
		Boychick.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN comes in and looks around. A long beat. Then a
	noise.

				BEN
		Mice...

	BEN is looking for mice. He opens a closet. Nothing. He
	shifts around. Nothing. He moves off.

	EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT

	The CABBIE slowly changes the TIRE. Fearing the worst,
	SPIDEY gets out, looking for a ride. A TRUCK approaches.
	SPIDEY looks down at the CABBIE and then up at the TRUCK.

				CABBIE
		Hey! You wanna hand me that lug wrench?

	He looks up to see SPIDEY go by, stuck to the side of the
	TRUCK like a spider.

				CABBIE
		Some crazy kinda town...

	EXT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT

	SPIDEY stares at the lettering on the side of the TRUCK.
	It says, "Victory Sporting Goods."

		Sporting goods...

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN comes in quietly. He looks around. He opens a

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	BEN runs through the rooms.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	as BEN goes to a drawer and pulls out a BOX of BULLETS.
	He begins to fight the BULLETS into the RIFLE.
	WEINER comes flying in and tackles him. They fall to the

		All I want it the kid's computer crap!

	PETER like a punch in the chest.

				PETER
		Uncle Ben!

				BEN
			(a wheeze)
		Peter...

	PETER rushes to BEN.

				PETER
		Oh my God... Uncle Ben...

	PETER tries to revive BEN, while WEINER runs out.

	INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

	PLASTIC FURNITURE, GARISH LIGHTING, CIGARETTES in the

	AUNT MAY and PETER embrace, leaning on each other for
	support.

				DETECTIVE
			(compassionate)
		Excuse me. You the nephew?

	PETER rises, nods. As AUNT MAY wipes away a sniffle...

				DETECTIVE
		Your uncle's a brave man. Apparently,
		the perpetrator was after something of
		yours. Your uncle didn't know what it
		was but he stood up to him anyway. You
		ought to be proud of him.

				PETER
		I am... how is he...

	A grim-faced DOCTOR walks slowly across the room to
	them... MAY stands up slowly.

				DETECTIVE
		Ask the Doctor.

				AUNT MAY
		How's my... how's my husband doing...?

				DOCTOR
		Mrs. Parker, I'm sorry. We tried.

	MAY collapses.

				DOCTOR
		Crash cart! STAT!

	The Detective pulls PETER gently away. The STAFF works on
	MAY.

				DETECTIVE
		Let the medics handle it.
			(pause)
		Look, if it makes you feel any better.
		We're gonna nail this guy. He crashed
		his getaway car. We got him trapped in a
		warehouse on Jackson.

				NURSE
			(to Peter)
		She's alright. She just fainted. We'll
		have to check her for symptoms of shock.
		If you want to wait, you can get some
		coffee on the third floor.

				PETER
		No, I... I think I wanna go out for some
		fresh air.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	COP CARS, COPS, SEARCHLIGHTS playing their BEAMS against

	one of the WINDOWS.

	EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT

	ELITE COPS in BASEBALL CAPS are plotting strategy.

				COP #1
		That place is loaded with solvents and
		chemicals. If we blast our way in, it's
		gonna go up like a roman candle.

				COP #2
		We could go in through the fifth floor
		wash room.

				COP #1
		What's that up there? Throw a light on
		that!

	COP #1 directs the BEAM of the SEARCHLIGHT.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN is climbing it, trapped in the GLARE of the
	SEARCHLIGHT. He freezes.

				COP #1
		He's got a partner!

	EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT

	Every COP'S WEAPON is trained upward at SPIDER-MAN!

				COP #2
			(on radio)
		We got an accomplice up there! And we

				RADIO
			(filtered)
		That's a go.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT

	GUNSHOTS erupt around SPIDER-MAN and he skitters around to
	evade them.

	INT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Thinking they're shooting at him, WEINER shoots back. In
	the corner of his eye he sees SPIDER-MAN at a side WINDOW.
	He aims his rifle and SPIDEY ducks out of the way.
	The frightened WEINER moves to the side WINDOW to blow
	SPIDEY away. As he moves past the front WINDOWS he is lit
	by the SEARCHLIGHTS that play on his face darkly.
	SPIDEY leaps in at FRONT WINDOW and drops neatly behind
	WEINER, landing a pose.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(cold, hard)
		Say your prayers, Weiner!

	WEINER whips around and fires. SPIDEY leaps to avoid it
	and lands on a STACK of PAINT CANS.

				WEINER
		You ain't takin' me... Spider-Man... who
		ever you are...

	SPIDEY gathers himself tighter. He leaps. A second GUN
	BURST comes in behind him, Several PAINT CANS erupt in
	cascades of COLOR.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(hanging on ceiling)
		Hey, creep!

	WEINER aims and fires, several times. He is emptying his
	RIFLE. SPIDEY leaps away and lands on the top of a CASK
	marked "CAUTION-FLAMMABLE SOLVENT!"

				SPIDER-MAN
			(taunting)
		Try again.

	The CASK gives way and SPIDEY is plunged into the
	FLAMMABLE SOLVENT. WEINER smiles his stupid grin and
	takes aim.

	SPIDEY leaps out of the CASK and sticks to the roof BEAM.
	He's sopping wet. His hand slips down the BEAM as the
	SOLVENT works against his sticking power.

	He falls to the floor and scrambles behind some PAINT
	CANS. WEINER, crazed, fires wildly. One of the CANS
	EXPLODES. PAINT flows from it... burning!

	SPIDEY peeks out and sees a YELLOW RIVER OF FLAME creeping
	toward him. He sniffs his SOLVENT soaked outfit.

	He backs down a "corridor" of PAINT CANS. The YELLOW FIRE
	follows, now joined by a RIVER OF BLUE FIRE from another
	can. They're following the trail of SOLVENT he's
	dripping!

	He's trapped!

				COP (V.O.)
			(on bullhorn)
		This is your last chance, you two.
		Either you're coming out, or we're coming
		in!

	SPIDEY'S against the WALL! PAINT CANS to his right and
	left, and a RIVER of RED FLAME joins the YELLOW and BLUE
	as they creep toward him!

	He climbs backwards up the wall, face toward the BLAZE.
	The COLORED FIRES join and follow him up the wall!
	They're licking at his feet!

				WEINER
			(at the window)
		Stay back!
			(gun burst)
		Whoa... stay back down there!

	SPIDEY is inches from being torched. He sees a PIPE. He
	reaches out and grabs it. He swings out above the flames.
	But the PIPE begins to bend!

	The PIPE bends down... down... and then breaks! SPIDEY
	hangs precariously as WATER cascades out of the PIPE and
	puts out the FIRE.

	SPIDEY drops down and rest his head in his hands to
	collect himself. Then looks up. The GUN is at his head.

				WEINER
		Stand up, you.

	SPIDEY stands.

				COP (V.O.)
		You have thirty seconds to come out!

				WEINER
		You're my ticket outa here. Gimme that
		stupid mask!

	SPIDER-MAN hesitates. Then he begins to raise the MASK,
	but stops and shakes his head no.

				WEINER
		Then I'll take it myself.

	He reaches for the mask and SPIDER-MAN flips him across
	the room. WEINER lands in a CARGO net and becomes
	ensnared.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Well, look what we've caught in our web...

				WEINER
		Don't hurt me, man. Please don't hurt me...

	INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	COPS are poised at the door. A signal. They crash
	inside.

	INT. WAREHOUSE PAINT ROOM - NIGHT

				COP #1
		Hold your fire!

	WEINER is hanging from the ceiling in the the CARGO NET.
				WEINER
		Get me out of this madhouse!

	He falls down, immediately encircled by the POLICE
	OFFICERS. SPIDER-MAN flies above their heads, crashing
	through the WINDOW and disappears into the dark of night.

	INT. CYCLOTRON - NIGHT

	A weird, flickering BLUE LIGHT dances around the hole in
	the CYCLOTRON. Then it cuts out. A HELMETED MAN pulls
	himself out of a HATCH. He flips up the HELMET.
	OCK is finishing putting together his new equipment.

				OCK
			(smiling)
		Okey, dokey.

	OCK goes about checking out the CYCLOTRON. It looks good.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK starts flicking switches and reading DIALS, doing a
	"mission countdown" for his next experiment. This place
	has been "hot rodded" to the max.

				OCK
			(reading dials and numbers)
		Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative
		variable differential... good enough.

	He shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down.

				OCK
		Okey, dokey... now all I need is Parker's
		data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it...
		I can't trust anybody.
			(throws his Waldo in the air)
		Only you, my babies... only you can I
		trust... Okay... If I have to do
		everything myself... I'm going to do it.
			(to his equipment)
		I'll be back... my babies... my new
		babies!

	OCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	There is more EQUIPMENT than before. PETER is deep at
	work. His SPIDER-MAN UNIFORM hangs on the WALL. There is
	a knock at the DOOR.

				LIZ (V.O.)
		Hey, Peter! Are you finished with my
		computer yet? I got a paper too, you
		know...

				PETER
			(panicked)
		Oh my God... oh, it's you, Liz... I
		didn't expect you... uh... give me a
		minute.

	He hides his SPIDER-MAN COSTUME.

	INT. THE HALLWAY LANDING - NIGHT

	LIZ waits impatiently.

				PETER
			(opening the door)
		Hi, Liz. Come on in.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	LIZ enters, looking around. PETER covers for this and
	that.

				LIZ
		What were you doing in here?

				PETER
			(looking around)
		Cleaning up. Come on. I'll get your
		computer. Where's Flash parked?

	He picks up the COMPUTER and turns to her, but she's
	already looking around the apartment.

				LIZ
		Flash didn't come.

				PETER
			(holding it)
		Oh. Well... how are you going to get it
		home?

	LIZ walks into the room.

				LIZ
		Taxi... I guess.

	She discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up
	around the apartment.

				LIZ
		You must spend a lot of time with this
		Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don't you think
		you ought to unplug that!

	PETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall.
	Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down.

				PETER
			(embarrassed)
		I, uh, I'll go down to the corner... see
		it I can hail that taxi.

	PETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he
	so...?

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A SHADOW of a MAN can be seen hiding. PETER does not
	notice him.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	There's a KNOCK at the DOOR.

				LIZ
			(crossing to it, wondering)
		Peter...?

	She is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash
	through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered
	doorway, WALDOS writhing.

				LIZ
		Doctor Octavius...! You're... You're...
			(finds the words)
		You're so weird!... with those... what do
		you call those...

				OCK
		Waldos... Did you hear about Spider-Man?
			(moving Waldos like spider's legs)
		That's me... the real Spider-Man... now
		tell me, where is that jerky friend of
		yours... Parker?

				LIZ
			(protecting)
		Peter?... oh... he's not here. He's gone.
		I don't think he'll be back for awhile.

				OCK
			(running his Waldo in her hair)
		You wouldn't lie to your Professor now,
		would you?

				LIZ
		Of course not. Why would I lie about a
		thing like that? Really. He's... out.

				OCK
		We'll wait.
		OCK grabs LIZ'S HAIR with his WALDOS.

				LIZ
		What are you doing... let me go! Please...
		take those things out of my hair!

				OCK
		My Waldos, you mean.

				LIZ
		Whatever you call them... please...

	OCK shoots out TWO WALDOS. Simultaneously each grabs a
	CHAIR from different parts of the room and brings them to
	the TABLE.

				OCK
		Sit.

	She does. He does, too, and folds his WALDOS across his
	chest.

				OCK
			(chatty)
		He's a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe,
		but nice, wouldn't you say?

				LIZ
		Oh, I don't know. Maybe. He's very
		inexperienced.

	ONE of OCK'S WALDOS rests on the TABLE curled around the
	COMPUTER. LIZ lets her hand rest on it. OCK warms
	immediately.

				OCK
		You know, you're a fascinating young lady...

				LIZ
		Thank you...

				OCK
		You're so refreshing. You're so...

				LIZ
		Shocking...?

				OCK
			(gone to far)
		Oh, I wouldn't say shocking...

				LIZ
		I would!

	She sticks his WALDO in the ELECTRIC WALL SOCKET behind
	the COMPUTER! The CURRENT sizzles through him and he
	leaps up, WALDOS akimbo, like the "cartoon cat." LIZ runs
	out the door.

	OCK extricates himself from the current and gives chase.

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ burst from the DOOR.

				LIZ
		Peter...!

	She looks both ways for PETER, doesn't see him, and takes
	off! OCK bursts from the doorway and runs off after LIZ.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	LIZ running as fast as she can, but OCK is gaining
	quickly.

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A TAXI drives up and disgorges PETER.

				PETER
		Wait here...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	He walks in. It's empty

				PETER
		Liz?

				LIZ (V.O.)
			(screaming from the street)
		Peter! Help! Peter!

	PETER springs into action. He grabs his SPIDEY SUIT out
	of a drawer and starts taking off his clothes.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	LIZ looks back and sees OCK CARTWHEELING toward her. She
	can't outrun him. She must hide. There's a CONSTRUCTION
	SITE on the right. She ducks down the alley next to it.

	INT. CONSTRUCTION ALLEY - NIGHT

	LIZ runs into it and finds herself trapped on three sides
	by a high CYCLONE FENCE. Behind her, OCK'S WALDOS stretch
	out like waterbug legs. He bug-walks into the alley and
	laughs down at her from his perch atop the WALDOS.

				OCK
		Peter Parker has something I want... And
		I'm going to have something he wants.

	She dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO
	ELEVATOR.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	She looks for the UP BUTTON and finds nothing! OCK, on
	his feet now, is on the wire mesh ELEVATOR CAGE in a
	flash. He tears the outer DOOR away.

	LIZ starts pressing KNOBS and LEVERS in panic. The LIGHT
	goes on. A WARNING BELL clangs. She finally finds the
	switch and the CAR leaps up just as OCK tears off its
	front door.

	LIZ, safe for the moment, watches OCK recede below,
	shaking the torn off door in a rage.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

	Extending WALDO over WALDO, OCK climbs the ELEVATOR
	HOUSING chasing the rising CAR inside.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION ROOF - NIGHT

	The CAR arrives and LIZ jumps out. She's on nothing but a
	narrow GIRDER! She tightropes on the GIRDER. OCK gets to
	the top. He looks across at her. She's stuck between two
	unfastened GIRDERS, at a dead end. He slowly telescopes a
	WALDO toward her. She's got no place to run, no place to
	hide. He grabs her by the BLOUSE and lifts her off the
	GIRDER.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
		Put her down, Ock.

	OCK looks across the street. There, on the top of a tall
	building, is SPIDER-MAN.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I know what's happening to you, Ock.
		I've been through a lot of changes myself
		lately. You have to listen to me.

				OCK
			(holding Liz)
		Who the hell are you?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Spider-Man.

				LIZ
			(seeing Spidey)
		Spider-Man...

				OCK
		That's a lot of crap, clown... I am
		Spider-Man, not you.
			(points to Liz)
		Ask you girlfriend.
			(to Liz)
		Tell him!

				SPIDER-MAN
		I'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock.
		Just like that girl you're holding. Now
		let her go.

	OCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the
	kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories
	up.

				OCK
		Let her go? What an excellent idea. If
		you do not deliver your friend, Mr.
		Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll
		let her go.

				LIZ
		Put me down, you mechanical mutant!

	LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She
	twists. She flails around, making things a little worse.
	The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP!
	PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets!
	SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his
	characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the
	falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short.

				LIZ
			(falling away)
		You jerk!

	He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to
	a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound.

				LIZ
			(straightening herself)
		Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get
		the taxi myself...

				OCK
			(screams)
		Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man...
		Prepare to meet your death, bug.

	SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(whispers)
		Actually, I'm rather fond of living...
		especially now...
			(he looks at Liz)

	He lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the
	cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above
	the street.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(a last appeal to reason)
		Octavius. Just stop and think.

				OCK
		I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking
		about exterminating you!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, if that's the way you want it...
		Let's see what those chrome knuckles can
		do, Doc...

	A WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw.
	It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and
	rolls over. He rubs his jaw.

				LIZ
		Great...

	SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by
	another barrage of blows from above.

				OCK
		Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown.

	OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY
	off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on.
	But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and
	swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER-
	ADVERSARIES engage in battle.

	With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and
	SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY,
	they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the
	CONSTRUCTION SITE.

				OCK
		Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one
		will be able to stop me.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Stop you from what...?

				OCK
		My destiny!

	OCK throws his biggest punch yet.

	SIRENS can now be heard in the street.

	SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes
	WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning
	circles.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Over here, Octopus!

				OCK
		That's Professor Octopus to you Spider
		Jerk!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Give it up, Professor. You'll never
		catch me!

	OCK takes three steps and soars through the air.

	EXT. BRICK WALL - NIGHT

	OCK, misjudging the leap, soars right past SPIDEY and into
	an alley! Screaming all the way...

	EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT

	OCK and TWO WALDOS pressed against each of the opposing
	walls. It's a tenuous grip. Then, very slowly, sparks
	flying from his WALDOS, OCK slides down into the alley.

				SPIDER-MAN
		So long, sucker.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	COP CARS pull up. COPS leap from them.

	EXT. SIDE WALL - NIGHT

	OCK makes it down, sees the COPS, ducks out of sight.

	EXT. COP CARS - NIGHT

	The SEARCHLIGHTS go on. SPIDER-MAN swings back across the
	street to the CONSTRUCTION SITE.

				COP #1
		There he is!

				COP #2
		It's that Spider-Man!

	EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

	SPIDEY lands next to LIZ in a pose. Lit by the flashing
	BILLBOARD, he's weirder looking than ever. SPIDEY puts an
	arm around LIZ and extends a WEB SHOOTER.

				LIZ
		What do you think you're doing?

				SPIDER-MAN
		I'm rescuing you.

	With that SPIDEY leaps way out and he and LIZ swoop away
	on a WEB-STRAND.

				LIZ
		Thanks but nooooooooooo!

	EXT. THE COP CARS - NIGHT

	ALL WEAPONS point upward at SPIDEY'S movement.

				COP #2
		He won't get away this time!

				COP #1
		Hold your fire! He's got a girl.

				COP #2
		Looks like he's got a hostage.

	EXT. WEB STRAND - NIGHT

	SPIDEY sees the WEAPONS aimed upward. He shoots out
	another WEB and swings off in a different direction. LIZ
	whoops with the G-force.

				LIZ
		Wait a minute. Where are you taking me?
		SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I better just take you back where you
		belong.

	He shoots out another WEB.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hold on tight.

				LIZ
			(Times Square)
		Where are we?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Open your eyes.

	They are standing on the ROOF of the CENTRAL TOWER of the
	EMPIRE UNIVERSITY BUILDING. LIZ opens her eyes. It's an
	extraordinary sight.

				LIZ
			(the Empire State Building)
		If you're trying to impress me Spidey, I
		want you to know I'm not easy. Okay, I'm
		impressed... now put me down, Spidey...
		put me down.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I like the way you say Spidey... Nobody
		calls me Spidey... now we go...

	EXT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

	They swoop down... and down... stopping on one of the
	building's SILLS, actually right in front of a WINDOW in
	the DORMITORY BUILDING.

				LIZ
			(Tavern on the Green)
		Wow... look, this is our dormitory. I
		can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute...
		there's Flash, if I'm not mistaken.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Liz?

				LIZ
		You know my name?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Liz, listen to me. There's something I
		have to tell you.

				LIZ
		Okay, put me down and we can talk,
		alright?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Do you know who I am?

				LIZ
		All I know is you're the Amazing
		Spider-Man... or better you're Spidey the
		good guy on the block... you're a weirdo
		in a clown spider suit.

				SPIDER-MAN
		And that's all you know about me?
			(a beat, a sigh)
		Okay, lets get your boyfriend.

				LIZ
		Which one?

				SPIDER-MAN
		How many do you have? I meant Flash.

				LIZ
		Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend...

				SPIDER-MAN
		He's not? Then who is?

				LIZ
		There's someone I like, but he's too shy
		to notice.
			(Flash appears)

				SPIDER-MAN
		Flash!

				FLASH
		Liz!
			(a beat)
		SPIDER-MAN!!!

				LIZ
			(to Spider-Man)
		You know everybody... Flash we have to
		call Peter!

	FLASH rushes right past LIZ to the WINDOW. There's a
	NEWSPAPER in his hand.

				FLASH
		Hey, they won't let up, man!
			(shows Daily Bugle)
		They keep calling you an accomplice in
		that burglary murder. But that's a crock,
		ain't it? I'm with you, Spidey, 100%

				SPIDER-MAN
		Thanks.

				FLASH
			(realizing)
		By the way, what are you doing with...
		Liz?

				SPIDER-MAN
		She needed a lift.

				FLASH
		Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A
		lot of beer!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Thanks, but I have some business to take
		care of.

				FLASH
		Well... take care of that later. Wait
		here. I'll get the beer.

	He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW
	where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES.

				LIZ
			(accusatory)
		How'd you know this was Flash's place?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Peter Parker told me all about it.

				LIZ
		Peter told you all about Flash?

				SPIDER-MAN
		No... he told me all about you. See you
		later.
			(he jumps away)

	INT. DORM - NIGHT

	FLASH comes in with more BEER than a man ought to carry.

				FLASH
		Hey, where'd he go? Hey, Spider-Man!!

	But SPIDER-MAN has disappeared.

				LIZ
			(distracted)
		Peter told your Hero all about me...

				FLASH
		He would, wouldn't he... that jerk!

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOF - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	He drops into the room and pulls off his MASK. The place
	has been ransacked. COMPUTER DISCS are all over the
	floor. PETER pulls a file marked "Planetary Conjunction."
	He opens it.

	A piece of PAPER falls out. It says, "Kiss it goodbye,
	Wall Crawler!"

				PETER
			(whispers angrily)
		Octavius!!!

	EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY

	PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself
	wonderfully.

				PETER
			(hurrying by)
		Kim! Have you seen Harry?

				KIM
		Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac...

				PETER
		Yeah... have you seen him today?

				KIM
		No, un unh.

				LIZ
			(catching up)
		Peter...!

				PETER
			(keeps walking)
		Hi... have you seen Harry?

				LIZ
		No. What a night, huh?

				PETER
			(laughs)
		Yeah, that was some ride home... must
		have been pretty exciting.

				LIZ
		It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets
		to Les Miserables... wanna go?

				PETER
		Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not
		tonight... see you later.

				LIZ
			(thinking)
		Hey, Peter... how did you know about last
		night...?

				PETER
		What about last night?

				LIZ
		My exciting ride with Spider-Man...

				PETER
		Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to
		find Harry... I'll see you later.

				LIZ
		Peter!

	PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it.

				PETER
		Hey! Can I get a lift downtown?

				FLASH
		Take your shoes for a walk, Dork.

	FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward
	LIZ.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	OCK is hard at work. The room, still rippled, has been
	"hot rodded" to the max. Lots of jerry-rigged stuff has
	been added.

	OCK takes a sip from the THERMOS and flicks on the small
	TAPE RECORDER.

				OCK
		We are new inserting Peter Parker's data
		on tonight's Planetary Conjunction.

	INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays Peter Parker's name
	and ID number and the title, "The Planetary Conjunction
	and it's effect on Earth Gravity."

				OCK
		Yes, yes! Go on! Go on!

	INSERT: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then a
	GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN,
	JUPITER, the SUN and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER
	rises.

				OCK
		Enormous. It's enormous.
			(to recorder)
		The Parker calculations add 4%
		gravitational force at the moment of full
		Planetary Conjunction.
			(hits some keys)
		Adding this to present maximum power
		potential, I get...

	He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC "HOLE" opening
	up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is
	swallowing everything!

				OCK
		I knew it. I knew it! Universal
		destruction! It's doable! I am putting
		a countdown clock on the Planetary
		Conjunction now!

	A LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY reads, "13:00:03." The last
	seconds count down to, "12:59:59!"

				OCK
			(playing the computer)
		Okey, dokey. Now let's see if I have
		enough power to drive this beast.

	He starts hitting KEYS on his COMPUTER.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	PETER is working on LIZ'S COMPUTER. There is a KNOCK at
	his brand new, unpainted DOOR. He hurries to it and pulls
	the KNOB so quickly (forgetting his own strength) that the
	whole assembly comes off in his hand.

				PETER
			(pulling Harry aside)
		I gotta remember to have that fixed.
			(opens the door)
		There you are, I've been looking for you
		all over town.

				HARRY
		What happened?

				PETER
		Where were you?

				HARRY
		I went to the wrestling, wanted to see
		that Amazing Spider-Man, but he didn't
		show up.

				PETER
		Listen, Harry something terrible happened.

				HARRY
		What? What?

				PETER
		My Planetary Conjunction papers... they
		were stolen...

				HARRY
		Oh my God... Are you sure...? Who would
		do such a thing?

				PETER
		Ock...

				HARRY
		Of course... but why...?

				PETER
		We have to find out, sit down.
			(indicates computer)
		I want to access Dr. Octavius' main
		program. I want to know about his
		experiments with the cyclotron. Can you
		do it?

				HARRY
			(starts hacking)
		I can try. I could access the system in
		the dorm. Okay. And through that I
		could crack the main line.

				PETER
		Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the
		Octavius file...

				HARRY
		Okay, let's try.

	HARRY cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to
	the task. The PHONE RINGS. PETER hits his jerry-rigged
	SPEAKER PHONE. HARRY keeps hacking.

				PETER
		Yeah?

				JAMESON (V.O.)
		Parker? Peter Parker? This is J. Jonah
		Jameson!

				PETER
			(looking over Harry's shoulder)
		Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time.

				JAMESON (V.O.)
		I need pictures of your friend, the
		Amazing Spider-Man. But I need bad guy
		shots, you got it? Lots of bad guy shots.
		We're gonna pin that insect to the wall.
		Whaddaya say?

	PETER hangs up. The DIAL TONE cuts off JAMESON.

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Only he and the PHOTO ASSISTANT are there.

				JAMESON
		What about that kid? On the job already?

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK is pacing around the hot rodded room. He checks this
	and that. He looks at the COUNTDOWN CLOCK (06:00:10) and
	throws himself down in his CHAIR. He resumes his check-
	down.

				OCK
		Fusion cells...? All up. Internal
		temperature... okay. Risk?
			(a long beat)
		Acceptable.
			(another beat)
		Let's fly.

	He starts flicking on SWITCHES and DIALS. The WHINE whirs
	up. He throws the RED POWER THROTTLE. The POWER DIAL
	goes to 90!

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	PETER and HARRY are at a COMPUTER. The LIGHTS flicker and
	dim. Then they go back on. PETER and HARRY look at each
	other and shrug.

				HARRY
		Got something!

	INSERT: DIGITAL CLOCK display: "06:00:03"

				PETER
		What is it?

				HARRY
		Let me see. It's some kind of countdown
		clock.

				PETER
		Countdown to what?

				HARRY
		I don't know, but whatever it is, it's
		only six hours away.

				PETER
		The Planetary Conjunction?

				HARRY
		Could be...

				PETER
		Or Doc Ock's end of the world experiment...
		Or both!

				HARRY
		Wait a minute. You're not telling me you
		think the world is gonna end tonight...?

				PETER
		You want to wait around till midnight to
		find out?

				HARRY
		No, but...

				PETER
		Let's see what else we've got.

	Another set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are
	accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS.

				HARRY
		What's that?

				PETER
		It might be a calculation of the amount
		of power he needs to create the hole
		between the force and the anti-force.

				HARRY
		That's a lot of energy. What could
		generate power like that?

				PETER
		The closest you could come is the New
		York City Subway System.

	Again, the lights flicker and then dim and they return.

	HARRY/PETER
			(together)
		We gotta talk to Professor Rosomorf!!

	INT. BROADWAY EXPRESS - NIGHT

	ROZ boards and takes a seat. There are the usual SUBWAY
	TYPES. A FAT WOMAN. A PIMPLY TEENAGER and his date, a
	TALL SKINNY GIRL in a PARTY DRESS.

	ROZ, making notations in a PAD, takes no notice of them.
	He sits down, closes his PAD, and taps a PENCIL against
	his chin.

				ROZ
		Plutonium...

	EXT. MAJOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT

	TAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar
	WHINE. The "WALK" and "DON'T WALK" signs FLASH at the
	same time.

	BOY
	Make up your mind!

	The signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The
	BOY looks at the GIRL.

				GIRL
		What's going on?

	An ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS
	of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner.

	INT. BROADWAY LOCAL - NIGHT

	SPARKS fly by the window. ROZ, oblivious at first, is now
	stunned by the show.

	EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY continue to rise. The STREET
	LIGHTS buckle and bend into weird shapes.

				WOMAN
		Oh my God!

				MAN
		Get back! Get back!

	EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

	TWO TAXIS roar through the intersection and COLLIDE. The
	ETHNIC DRIVERS leap out and begin arguing.

	INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	PEOPLE SCREAM and fall back as the TRAIN seems to change
	angles.

	EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	A building ROAR rises from the SUBWAY ENTRANCE. Then the
	sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE! The BOY looks down the STAIRS
	and has to leap out of the way as the BROADWAY EXPRESS
	comes highballing up the STEPS and blasts through the
	SUBWAY entrance.

	The TRAIN sails through the air.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	The TRAIN crashes into the building in a storm of
	cyclotron generated Dali physics.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The THROB and PULSE recede. SCREAMS, HONKS, SIRENS can be
	heard.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	A splendidly turned out MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN wakes from her
	satin sleep to see that a SUBWAY TRAIN is in the middle of
	her BEDROOM. The WALL through which the train has come
	sags and ripples like it has melted and partially
	resolidified.

				WOMAN
		Henry!!!

	Several PASSENGERS climb out of the WINDOWS of the TRAIN
	or pry open the DOORS.

				WOMAN
		What are you doing here? Get out of here!
		Get out of here!

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	A CROWD has gathered to gawk and point. They look up and
	we see their POV.

	The MIDDLE CAR of the TRAIN is simply "embedded" in the
	HIGH-RISE, its rear sticking out of the building fifteen
	stories up. From its COUPLING dangles the LAST CAR.

	INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT

	The car is bisected in the middle by the fused brick and
	glass of the WALL of the building. PASSENGERS on the
	outside of the WALL press their faces to the GLASS and
	pound for help.

	ROZ comes to the aid of a MOTHER with TWO CHILDREN.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The CROWD sees something else. Swinging high in the sky
	is your friendly neighborhood SPIDER-MAN. The COUPLE and
	TWO DRIVERS argue about what this means.

				WOMAN
		It's Spider-Man!

				TRUCK DRIVER #1
		Get outa here, you bum!

				WOMAN
		Hey, what are you talking about?!

				TRUCK DRIVER #2
			(back at woman)
		What's the matter, lady don't you read
		the papers?

	This is the DRIVER of a DAILY BUGLE truck carrying the
	historically famous Bugle headline, "Spider-Man - Threat
	or Menace?"

				MAN
		Go Spidey! Go!

	INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT

	It's nearly vertical! People are tumbled over each other.
	The scared TEENAGER is tearing at the door. The SKINNY
	GIRL screams in a mechanical way. The DOOR opens. He
	nearly falls!

	The SKINNY GIRL screams again. He manages to get back
	inside. She looks at him, safe now. But she screams
	again anyway.

	ROZ struggles to right himself against a pole. A BAG OF
	GROCERIES goes sliding past him. It continues downward
	and out the OPEN DOOR.

	INSERT: The BAG tumbles down through the air. Down, down,
	and down...

	INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY'S face appears in the WINDOW upside down.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hello, everybody...

	He slides the WINDOW down and flips inside. He walks
	through the parting PASSENGERS to the BUILDING WALL. He
	feels it.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, everyone, stand back and stay cool.

	He hurls himself at the fused GLASS portion and bounces
	back onto the floor. He rolls over, flexing his shoulder.

				WOMAN
			(whining)
		Is that the real Spider-Man?

	SPIDEY does a TRIPLE FLIP to his feet. He reaches up for
	the overhead RAILING and pulls it down easily. Oohs and
	aahs. SPIDER-MAN points it at the GLASS and hefts it.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Somebody wanna give me a hand with this?

	First the WOMAN, and then all of them, take up positions
	on the BATTERING RAM.

				SPIDER-MAN
		On three. One... Two... Three!

	They ram the GLASS and it shatters.

	INT. THE LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	HENRY stands at the open DOOR of the TRAIN in his bedroom
	as they all come rushing through into the room.

	HENRY
	Come on. Come on. That's it. Step
	lively now.

	WIFE
	Henry, the rugs!

	HENRY
	Oh, shut up!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Have a nice evening, Ma'am... and you
		too, Henry.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The FIRE TRUCKS arrive and begin assembling a LADDER.

	INT. THE LAST CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY arrives at the DOOR at the top of the CAR. He sees
	ROZ at the bottom. THREE PEOPLE are between them. The
	SKINNY GIRL sees SPIDEY. She screams.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, folks, just hang on...

	He scampers down the GRAB-HANDLES to the people below.
	FOUR PASSENGERS cling to SEATS and BARS.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, one at a time. You first, Ma'am...

	A FAT WOMAN makes a "who me?" gesture. SPIDEY throws her
	over his shoulder.

	INSERT: THE COUPLING which holds the two CARS at right
	angles begins to bend open.

	SPIDER-MAN, the FAT WOMAN over his shoulder, goes hand
	over hand to the top and the WOMAN is dumped into the
	MIDDLE CAR.

	INSERT: THE COUPLING bends open a little more.

	SPIDEY helps the TEENAGER and the SKINNY GIRL out of the
	CAR. She takes the dreadful step between cars. She looks
	down. She screams. She steps across.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	The FIRE LADDER is up. But it is about TEN FEET short of
	where it's aimed at. The end of the CAR. A FIREMAN
	stands at its apex.

				FIREMAN
			(into walkie)
		Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder!

	WALKIE
	Negative on that, you're at full
	extension!

	INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT

	Now only ROZ is left. SPIDEY approaches him. He clings
	to a POLE.

	INSERT: The COUPLING bends open! The CAR is hanging there
	from memory!

				ROZ
		This is Doctor Otto Octavius' work. I
		must get back to my university. I must
		stop Ock... he's gone crazy. Can you
		help me?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Sure thing, just don't take the train.
		Come on... give me your hand.

				ROZ
		Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do
		this with the train, if he's come this
		far, then I can pretty well predict his
		next step. He'll go to Plutonium SL 270
		for the power. He must be stopped... or
		else he'll destroy our world.

	The COUPLING shrieks and the CAR lurches.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Let's get you out of here first,
		Professor.

				ROZ
		Wait Spider-Man. I don't think I can
		make it... You mustn't waste time saving
		me... you must save the world! You must
		go and stop Ock!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Where can I find him...?

				ROZ
		He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I'm
		sure...

	The CAR lurches on its side and ROZ flies out of the DOOR.
	SPIDEY THWIPS out a WEB that girdles ROZ'S waist.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Think Rosomorf, think where one can find
		Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270...?

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	ROZ is hanging in mid-air on the WEB.
	ROZ shouts.

				ROZ
			(shouting)
		There's only one place he can get the
		Plutonium SL 270...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Where...?

				ROZ
		Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump
		would have SL 270.

	SPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ
	on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in
	the doorway, manipulating the WEB.

	The FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of
	steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With
	SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the
	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	COPS, FIREMEN, PRESS, the works. The CROWD GASPS. CAMERA
	STROBES pop as the LAST CAR crashes to the SIDEWALK. We
	hold several beats on the incredible rubble.

	Then, a WEBBED HAND. SPIDER-MAN groggily pulls himself
	from the wreckage.

				COP (V.O.)
		Put your hands up, Spider-Man.

				SPIDER-MAN
		You're making a big mistake.

				COP
		And you're looking at twenty years.

	SPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP'S GUN and
	leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO... and swings up out of the
	frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a
	THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet
	and falls limp.

				COP
		What the hell!

	EXT. BACK OF BUILDING - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the
	end of a WEB STRAND. After falling ten stories, he is
	groggy and weak. He can't think. He can't focus. He can
	barely hold onto his WRIST GIZMOS. This bug is spent.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270
		Plutonium... must get that crazy old
		loony... before he gets to the
		Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the
		toxic dumps...?

	He hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and
	thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across
	on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely.

	INT. AUNT MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	LIZ is standing. AUNT MAY is seated on the COUCH, she
	looks weak, pale and alone.

				AUNT MAY
		You're as lovely as Peter said you were.

				LIZ
			(embarrassed)
		Thank you. He really wanted so badly to
		come see you. He called me up out of the
		blue.

				AUNT MAY
			(great concern)
		Tell me about Peter. What's he been up
		to? He seems so preoccupied.

				LIZ
		Oh, you know Peter... he's all caught up
		in some kind of study he's doing. Things
		are really crazy at the university now.
		Things are crazy... everywhere. I guess
		Peter's just... well, you know... pulled
		into his shell.

				AUNT MAY
			(reminiscing)
		When Peter was little, he loved to hide.
		In the closets. Under the sink. He
		always needed a secret place. But when
		I'd look for him, he'd always laugh... he
		wanted to be found.

				LIZ
		Yeah... well. I don't think he wants me
		to find him... Well, I'd better be going.
		My friend Flash is picking me up.

				AUNT MAY
		This Flash... he isn't your boyfriend, is
		he?

				LIZ
		No... not really... I think you can guess
		why...

	They smile knowingly at each other.
	LIZ goes toward the DOOR.

				AUNT MAY
		Elizabeth...?
		She turns.

				AUNT MAY
		Finders keepers, losers weepers.

				LIZ
		What?

				AUNT MAY
		That's what I used to say to Peter when I
		found him.

	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN swings high above it. This is not the
	confident swinger with LIZ in his arms. This is a guy
	who's making it by the narrowest of margins. There is a
	traffic jam below.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Got to find Ock... got to find the toxic
		dumps.
			(grabs his head)
		Oh! Oh! Oh... yeah!

	He looks down at the traffic. We PAN across the many CARS
	until we come to a non-descript GREEN CAR.

	INT. GREEN CAR - NIGHT

	OCK is honking the HORN. Something lands on his ROOF.
	Then SPIDEY sticks his head, upside down, in the
	windshield.

				SPIDER-MAN
		What's up, Ock?

				OCK
		You!!!

	A WALDO smashes through the WINDSHIELD but misses SPIDEY.
	OCK leaps from the CAR.

				OCK
			(on the run)
		You're a doomed bug, Wall Crawler. I've
		no time to waste on you now.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	OCK runs through HONKING TRAFFIC. SPIDER-MAN leaps from
	CAR to CAR.

	OCK turns to see SPIDER-MAN leap to a LIMO at the curb.
	OCK turns tail and runs down an alley. A FEMALE COP pops
	out of a DOORWAY. Her partner, a BIG, YOUNG COP, pulls
	his GUN.

				FEMALE COP
			(gun poised)
		Alright! Freeze! Up against the wall
		and spread 'em

	OCK complies. He raises his hands... and spreads the
	WALDOS to full extension! The BIG COP screams and faints.
	The little FEMALE COP'S eyes POP. OCK swats the GUN from
	her hand. He starts to choke her.

	SPIDEY comes swinging to the rescue. He lands on the ROOF
	nearby.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hey, you big OCK, why don't you pick on
		someone your own size?!

				OCK
		Alright Spider-Bug... here I've come for
		you...

	OCK leaves the COP and attacks SPIDER-MAN, shooting his
	iron fist at him. OCK runs to the end of the alley.
	SPIDEY staggers to his feet and resumes the chase.
	OCK breaks into a red Corvette convertible, starting it
	with a WALDO.

	SPIDER-MAN comes out in time to see the Vette drive away.
	A CHINESE LAUNDRY TRUCK is passing. SPIDEY THWIPS it and
	is whipped away.

	He crawls over to the WINDOW.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hey, driver. Could you follow that red
		Vette for me?

	The surprised CHINAMAN lets loose a stream of CHINESE
	expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures.
	SPIDER-MAN crawls to the top of the TRUCK and surveys the
	situation. He sees a sea of moving traffic. He THWIPS up
	a WEB and swings away.

	SPIDEY swings along from BUILDING to BUILDING. The RED
	VETTE is making headway. Suddenly, SPIDER-MAN spots a
	blue MG with its top up.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(swinging)
		Flash Thompson... I never thought I'd be
		happy to see you.

	EXT. BLUE MG - NIGHT

	SPIDEY swoops down on the BLUE MG.

	INT. BLUE MG - NIGHT

	SPIDEY wedges down into the car, right between FLASH and
	LIZ. She WHOOPS. FLASH is thrilled.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Sorry about that!

				FLASH
		Spider-man! This is unbelievable...!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Flash, I need your help.

				FLASH
		You got it.

				SPIDER-MAN
		You any good with this thing?

				FLASH
		I'm the best.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay... catch that Vette!

				FLASH
		Roger, wilco, over and out.

	He swerves. SPIDEY falls all over LIZ. They begin to
	careen through traffic, three peas in a very small pod.

	EXT. WEST SIDE CAR CHASE MONTAGE - NIGHT

	With SPIDEY jammed in between LIZ and FLASH, the MG chases
	the VETTE. Since neither OCK nor FLASH is any good at
	this, both cars quickly careen into POLES, FENCES, HOT DOG
	CARS and begin falling apart.

	On RIVERSIDE DRIVE the MG begins to lurch and STEAM. The
	VETTE looks eaten away. The GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE
	looms ahead.

	The VETTE roars through the TOLL BOOTH. They spot OCK
	stuck in traffic.

				FLASH
		Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is
		it in that shitty red car...

				LIZ
		Don't you recognize him... it's Ock!

				SPIDER-MAN
		New Jersey has the largest toxic waste
		dump in the world.

				FLASH
		What does he want with toxic waste?

				SPIDER-MAN
		He's looking for Plutonium, my dear...
		The car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam.

				FLASH
		Sorry... can't do anything about this
		traffic.

	SPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Try to stay with me. I don't want to
		lose him!

	Speeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high
	above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At
	the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The
	VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For
	a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes
	it across.

	The VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN.
	He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take
	the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the
	ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It
	says, "DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!"

				SPIDER-MAN
		Bingo.

	INT. TOXIC WASTE DUMP - NIGHT

	The landscape has a nightmarish vision, weirdly lit by
	"safety lights." VATS and DRUMS ooze all kinds of bad
	stuff. A light is on in a dilapidated SHACK.

	INT. THE SHACK - NIGHT

	OCK is tossing away the CANISTERS until he comes to one
	marked, "HAZARD!! PLUTONIUM SL 270 HAZARD!!"

				OCK
		Okey, dokey...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Open that now, and you'll spoil Christmas.

	SPIDEY'S peering in from a HOLE in the ROOF.

				OCK
		Insect! I am going to squash you to
		death... Once I lay my Waldos on your
		skinny bones...

	OCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of
	LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the
	door with his SL 270.

	EXT. THE SHACK - NIGHT

	OCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO.
	SPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO
	snaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror.
	With a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as
	SUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses
	SPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes
	SPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing.

	EXT. THE DUMP - NIGHT

	OCK'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN'S neck as the
	WEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES
	narrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING
	SIGN. OCK tears off the CAP and then hurls the groggy
	SPIDEY down the WELL.

				OCK
		Goodbye, Spider-Man!

	INT. THE WELL - NIGHT

	SPIDEY falls. He cannot grab onto the slimy WALLS. At
	the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling BLUE luminescent
	POOL. SPIDEY claws frantically at the WALLS.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Noooooooooooooo!

	He gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the
	POOL. Its weird light shines up at him. He looks up at
	the starry sky.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(to himself)
		Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it.

	He shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the
	wall, sizzles, and drops back down.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(to himself)
		Don't give up, Spidey. Don't give up.

	The WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO.
	Then it hisses, empty!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Empty... now what do I do?

				OCK
		So you've avoided the nuclear pool, have
		you, Spider-Man?

				SPIDER-MAN
		Well, so far so good. But I can't hold
		on much longer.

				OCK
		Pity...!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport. Let's
		talk this over face to face... throw me a
		line...

	SPIDEY reaches out.

				OCK
		Okay... face to face... Catch this!

	OCK, way up at the opening above, raises a huge DRUM above
	his head. The DRUM leaks toxic waste in ORANGE TENDRILS.
	He is about to drop it down on SPIDER-MAN...

				FLASH
		Don't do it, Professor!

	We now see FLASH and LIZ in the BLUE MG.

				OCK
			(puts down the drum)
		I know you... and you, young lady. Both
		of you are in my physic class, aren't
		you...? Come... you can help me. I need
		to get some of these drums to my
		laboratory... help me... and I'll give
		you special grades. What'd you say?

	Suddenly he catches FLASH with a WALDO and starts to choke
	him. LIZ screams and tries to help FLASH.

				LIZ
		Leave him alone!!!

	Another WALDO grabs her.
	ROZ now appears on the scene.

				ROZ
		Leave them alone Otto!

				OCK
		But, they won't help me. Everybody is
		trying to destroy my experiment. And so
		are you, Rosomorf.

	Another WALDO grabs ROZ by his arm.

				ROZ
		Otto... I was wrong. I've gone over your
		research. It's brilliant, Otto. It's
		mad, but it's brilliant. You have much
		work left to do. I want to help you,
		Otto. For the sake of science, go and do
		your experiment. Leave... these kids
		alone and I'll help you.

				OCK
		You will? You too?

	Both FLASH and LIZ shake their heads okey dokey. OCK
	gestures to FLASH and LIZ.

				OCK
		Help me with these drums, I need to get
		them to my laboratory immediately.

				ROZ
		Do as he says.

	OCK pushes FLASH and LIZ with his iron arm. Gripping LIZ
	be her hair, he shoves her into the CAR.

				OCK
		Drive, Flash, before I flush your girl
		right down the toilet!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Professor Rosomorf, it's no good, double
		dealing... why did you help him...?

	ROSOMORF finds a rope and looks into the well.

				ROZ
		Don't lose your energy screaming. Catch
		this rope and climb up, come on!

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	They drive along the highway. SPIDEY is recovering,
	working his neck.

				ROZ
		I've been through the Octavius data. He
		has enough power with his Plutonium.
		Especially if he gets his hands on
		Parker's data, there he has enough power
		to do what he wants to do. And we are
		not going to stop him in time before the
		Planetary Conjunction occurs tonight...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Stop the car. I have an idea.

	They're in the middle of RIVERSIDE DRIVE but a PHONE BOOTH
	is coming up on the right.

	INSERT: ROZ'S foot stabs the BRAKE.

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY gets out of the car. Then he pats himself where
	his pockets ought to be.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Do you have a dime?

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	HARRY is there, working on the COMPUTER, PHONE RINGS,
	HARRY picks up.

				PETER
		Harry?!

				HARRY
		Peter, where are you?

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				SPIDER-MAN
		Listen, Harry. You must get my paper
		before Ock uses it...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				HARRY
		Your Planetary Conjunction data? It's
		too late... Ock's got your paper, it's in
		his computer already.

	INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays a graphic of the SUN,
	EARTH, and MOON lining up with JUPITER and SATURN.

				HARRY
		But don't worry... he can never use it
		without Plutonium.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
		He's got the Plutonium, and he's on his
		way back to the lab! And he's got two
		prisoners with him... Liz and Flash!

				HARRY
		Don't worry... he needs a huge amount of
		power... thousands of volts of
		electricity... to get to the Anti-Force.

				SPIDER-MAN
		He can get to the power. Electrical
		power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL
		270. And now, at the moment of full
		Planetary Conjunction. When all the
		planets line up with the sun... maximum
		gravitational power. The Conjunction is
		Ock's final power source.

				HARRY
		Damn... the Conjunction is due at
		midnight! What are we going to do?

	EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT

	The BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his
	two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself...
	Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder.

				OCK
		Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones...
		for the last time.

	OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back
	seat of the CAR.

				LIZ
			(still ministering)
		What do we do now?

				FLASH
		We kiss the world goodbye. If he is
		right, all there is left to do is...

				LIZ
		Wait... I think I can release my right
		hand...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				HARRY
		How much time is left? Wait... I can
		find out... my God... 59 minutes!

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				SPIDER-MAN
		The only way we can interfere with Ock's
		plan is to find a computer center... fast.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Our University has the biggest center in
		town.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Yeah, but who's gonna work 'em?

	EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT

	Professor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ
	and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS.
	HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school
	grounds.

				HARRY
		I think I can get some help... I can
		teach anyone how to work a code in five
		minutes.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)
		Then do it!

	INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

	The LIGHTS are off, but the COMPUTERS are on. HARRY looks
	over LIZ'S shoulder as she cracks through a code. Her
	SCREEN reads out, "CONNECTICUT. TECH. Fully Op, Line
	Backlog, Security Max Level." The last line is FLASHING.

				KIM
		Hey, this is easy.

	They all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER.

				FLASH
		Hey, Harry I need help.

				HARRY
		Coming!

	HARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He
	looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. "01:00:02" becomes
	"00:59:59" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER!

				KIM
		I got one! I got one!

				LIZ
		Harry! Get over here!

	HARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the
	CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing "WARNING, Security Breach!"
	HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around.
	LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to
	small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a
	PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend
	"H20".

				HARRY
		A goddamn water leak...

				FLASH
		Hey, look at this. Empire State
		University. This is our cyclotron,
		right?

				HARRY
			(serious)
		What does it say?

				FLASH
			(hits two keys)
		It says "no information on net."

				HARRY
		Damn... we can't do it...

				KIM
		You mean... we can't stop loony Ock...

				HARRY
		I mean the world is in danger...

				FLASH
		We must find Peter, he knows these
		computers better than all of us.

				HARRY
		Yes, but where the hell is he?

				LIZ
			(mysteriously)
		I bet he is with Spider-Man...

	Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake.

	EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK

	The EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of
	the CONJUNCTION.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	HARRY and FLASH and LIZ and KIM, (the EARTH is SHAKING)
	come out running from the building beneath an enormous
	HANGING MOON. They are frightened.

	Suddenly it all stops. It's quiet, the kids look at the
	sky.

				LIZ
		Look at the moon... I have never seen it
		so big.

				FLASH
		What is that...

				HARRY
		Must be the sun.

	We now see the sky. With the sun on one side, and the
	moon on the other. They watch it, shocked, frightened out
	of their wits.

	EXT. END OF THE WORLD MONTAGE - NIGHT

	Suddenly from OCK'S basement lab a BLUE BEAM of LIGHT
	breaks through. A WHINE starts, it moves magically out of
	the WINDOW and PANS around a sleepy NEW YORK which doesn't
	know that the end is upon it. The dreaded WHINE builds
	throughout! People stop in their tracks, look up to the
	strange looking skyline. Camera comes down to a street
	where ROZ is DRIVING SPIDER-MAN fast toward the
	UNIVERSITY.

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	ROZ looks out over the skyline of NEW YORK. Lighted
	buildings FLARE UP and then GO DARK. The LIGHTED SPIRE of
	the Empire State Building FLARES UP and EXPLODES.

				SPIDER-MAN
		It's started. Step on it Professor, or
		we'll never make it.

	They look across the campus and a strange LIGHT is coming
	out of the SCIENCE CENTER.

				ROZ
		Our campus... right there... see those
		beams from Ock's lab. We're late... it's
		coming... the Conjunction will happen in
		a few seconds.

	SPIDER-MAN massages his arm.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Stop the car...! Come with me.

				ROZ
		Where...? What...?

	SPIDER-MAN SHOOTS out a WEB and flies toward the SCHOOL
	BUILDING taking ROZ with him.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	It is a patchwork of make-shift repairs. OCK looks in
	through a WINDOW that's been melted out. He is lost in a
	mad rapture.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	RED POWER THROTTLE is at 95% POWER!
	SPIDER-MAN and ROZ enter, shielding their eyes from the
	GLARE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:08:18".

				OCK
			(looking back, madly)
		Aha! You never included the Conjunction
		in your calculations, did you?! Rosomorf!

				ROZ
		Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you
		have to hear me! The world we know will
		collapse! Everything we have devoted our
		lives to... all the patterns, all the
		harmonies... everything will be destroyed.

				OCK
		A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my
		destiny!!!

				ROZ
		It is cosmic suicide! You have no right!

	ROZ flings himself through the MELTED WINDOW into the
	EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. He grabs for the "BULLET" but the
	WALDOS grab him and throw him back. ROZ staggers
	backward... into the arms of SPIDER-MAN.

				ROZ
		You have to stop him... Spider-Man you
		have to stop him.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I'm afraid we're too late.

	SPIDER-MAN attacks OCK, trying to push him away from the
	THROTTLE. OCK pushes SPIDER-MAN away from him so strongly
	that SPIDER-MAN is knocked down. OCK nudges the POWER
	THROTTLE forward and the WHINE increases to an ear
	shattering pitch. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:06:48".
	We are at 96% POWER!

	EXT. THE SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	We PAN down from the MOON to a STREET full of SIRENS and
	SHADOWY FIGURES running in the night. LIZ and KIM and
	HARRY come nearer. A very WEIRD light is emanating from
	the CENTER.

				LIZ
		He's in there. I know Peter is in there.
		She breaks into a run.

				FLASH
		Liz, don't... Liz come back... come back!
		LIZ runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF
		ELECTRICITY flashes across the doorway, stopping them.

	INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The PLANETS are playing on the COMPUTER SCREEN. Things in
	the room begin to rise, weightless. The ENERGY STORM is
	brewing!

				OCK
		Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has
		started. My Anti-Force is on! History
		is being made... Spider-Man, Rosomorf
		cheer up friends... we're on our way to
		the unknown cosmos... we three are about
		to visit heaven... real Gods heaven.

				ROZ
			(sees the sky through the window)
		Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It's
		happening!

	EXT. THE SKY - STRANGE COLORS - NIGHT

	The CONJUNCTION is now happening.

	INSERT: Surreal DIALS spin madly.

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	LIZ runs into a HALLWAY gone berserk. Stuff is flying
	everywhere. TILES pull from the WALLS and crash to the
	ceiling.

				LIZ
		Peter! Peter, where are you?!

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK throws the RED POWER THROTTLE to 97% POWER.
	Cacophony! The "BULLET" begins to PULSE and THROB! The
	DIALS spin! The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:05:58".

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	The FULL MOON hangs over the building. FLASH and HARRY
	and KIM stand at the entrance to the CENTER.
	FLASH starts to run to the building.

				FLASH
			(screaming)
		Liz! Liz come on out!

	They run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the
	building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall
	of STONE and DIRT, six feet high.

				HARRY
		Get back! Flash... get back!

				FLASH
		Wow...!

	Then the building lurches upward again! This time it
	pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER
	LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK.

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ opens a door.

				LIZ
		Peter!

	The building lurches throwing her back across the HALL
	where she crashes through another door.

	INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT

	All manner of stuff is flying around. LIZ comes sliding
	across the floor. She crashes into a CABINET. GLASSWARE
	starts to fall on her, but crashes into the CEILING
	instead. She is dragged up the WALL. She kicks and
	screams against the Anti-Force.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	FLASH, KIM and HARRY look on as heavy ELECTRICAL CABLES
	stretch upward to the rising CENTER and then snap in
	showers of sparks. As they fall away the CENTER becomes
	airborne. The CABLES wave up at it, shooting arcs of
	ELECTRICITY directly at the building.

	INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT

	LIZ slides down the WALL. She grabs at the WINDOW and
	looks out. The rest of the university recedes beneath
	her, now a hundred feet below. And they're still rising!
	FLASH and HARRY look up.

				FLASH
		Oh my God... Liz is inside there!

				HARRY
		And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock.

				FLASH
		What about Peter? Is he there with them?

				HARRY
		No, but I bet Spider-Man is.

	EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	People look up at the SCIENCE CENTER. A CYCLIST, riding
	and looking, crashes into a TAXI. MAX REISS leaps out
	with the BEAUTIFUL STARLET from the TAXI.

				MAX
		That's some show... if ever I saw one.

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	He's looking out his window seeing the University's Lab
	Building flying by. Up and up toward the sky.

				JAMESON
			(shouting)
		Tear out the front page! Change the
		headline... The biggest news is happening
		right now... we need photos... a camera...
		get me a camera...!

	EXT. SKY - NIGHT

	A very long shot of the SCIENCE CENTER rising into the
	CLOUDS.

	INT. AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She pulls aside a CURTAIN and watches the SCIENCE CENTER
	rise.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK works the COMPUTER as the CONSOLE sends up SHOWERS of
	SPARKS. He glances at the "BULLET" which now PULSES.
	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK at "00:04:18".

				ROZ
		Where is it going Otto?

				OCK
		Other worlds, Roz, other times, other
		dimensions, who knows? Who cares?

				ROZ
		Then... why?

				OCK
		Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new
		truth! The new way!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Don't listen to him Professor Roz.

				OCK
		No, you don't listen to that clown, he
		can't save you, or the world for that
		matter.

	A WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him
	back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE
	STATION (HOSE, EXTINGUISHER, AXE).

	We see the WALDO reach out for SPIDER-MAN. It wraps
	around his FOOT and begins to tug, slowly...

				OCK
		Once and for all, Spider-Man... once and
		for all we'll end the legend of your
		powers.

	OCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO.
	OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that's
	been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY.
	We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We
	see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes
	flying in with the FIRE AXE.

	ROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump
	withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury!

				OCK
			(ultimate betrayal)
		You!! You were my teacher!!!

	ROZ doesn't even look back. He and SPIDEY are at the edge
	of the HOLE and he's shaking SPIDEY furiously.
	OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the
	floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY. Like
	a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the
	floor again and again.

				OCK
		You were my teacher! And you want to
		destroy my experiment. You are a
		scientist for heaven sake... don't you
		want to know what's up there?

				ROZ
		Yes, but not on account of our world. We
		have only one world... only one life.
		The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a
		hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as the
		section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and
		falls through.

	SPIDEY grabs hold of the edge and dangles. He looks down
	and sees ROZ falling away beneath him, disappearing into
	the dark.

				ROZ
			(calling back from the dark skies)
		Spider-Man! Only you can save us now...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Roz!!!
			(turns to Ock)
		Murderer!!!

				OCK
		Forget that old fool, insect. My
		Spider-Man... Come join me on my
		fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven.

	EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK

	The PLANETS are virtually in line!

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ comes running through it. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY
	shoots from the right to the left in front of her. She
	slams on the brakes and runs the other way.

				LIZ
		Peter! Peter!

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:02:59". OCK throws the
	POWER THROTTLE to 98% POWER. He laughs and a WEB splats
	against his GLASSES. SPIDEY scrambles to his feet. OCK,
	still trying to get the WEB GOO off his GLASSES, is
	slammed into the CONSOLE by SPIDER-MAN. SPARKS fly and
	WALDOS flail blindly, smashing things. OCK tears off his
	GLASSES and squints through the FIRE and SMOKE and GLARE.
	SPIDER-MAN THWIPS the ceiling and swings into a drop kick!
	OCK recovers. He grabs SPIDEY and slam dunks him through
	the hole in the floor.

	EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN falls through the air. He shoots up a WEB and
	THWIPS, it sticks to the ROCKY bottom of the FOUNDATION.
	OCK appears in the HOLE. He sees SPIDEY'S dilemma,
	hanging on a thread of WEB. A half-broken WALDO snakes
	down and CLIPS the WEB.

	But the WEB sticks to the WALDO! OCK shakes it, but he
	can't get loose. SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the
	ROCK BOTTOM and, with the leverage, he pulls OCK out.
	OCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the
	ROCK upside down. He holds on fiercely.

	OCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins
	looking for an entry. SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail.
	The building pitches sideways! OCK turns to face SPIDER-
	MAN, his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE.

	SPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off,
	brandishing it like a broad sword.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Let's have it, old boy!
		A bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way
		and that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold,
		from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET.

	Now the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL
	upside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes
	flying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Liz!!
		OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the
		head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now
		lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY
		ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE.

	SPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of
	SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Come on.

				LIZ
		Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere.

				SPIDER-MAN
			(pulling her ahead)
		He's around, don't worry... we'll find
		him.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:01:00" as SPIDEY comes
	flying in with LIZ in tow.

				LIZ
		This building is flying. I'm in a
		goddamn flying building...

				SPIDER-MAN
		I think we have to pull some of these
		cables. Try those over there. I'll work
		on these. We gotta slow this thing down
		somehow. We got helicopters coming.

	LIZ looks at some WIRING, apprehensive about even touching
	it.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Pull!

	She yanks out a CABLE. The building pitches. But when
	SPIDEY pulls one out, it rights itself.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	The BIG BEAMS start cutting out one by one. The CENTER
	begins to PITCH and YAW. The CHOPPERS are getting closer.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:00:15" as SPIDEY and LIZ
	continue to pull WIRES and CABLES. TWO WALDOS erupt
	through the floor and grab SPIDEY. They pull SPIDEY to
	the floor. Entangled in these molybdimum pythons, SPIDEY
	struggles valiantly. LIZ leaps to his aid.

				LIZ
		Oh my God...

	A third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and
	begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER
	THROTTLE.

				SPIDER-MAN
		The power!

	LIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE.
	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at "00:00:10". LIZ leaps and tries
	to wrestle it away. It whips in her arms and she holds on
	tight. It bangs her against the wall and then the
	CONSOLE. She holds on. "00:00:03". The WALDO crashes
	LIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS. She lets go
	of it. It heads for the POWER THROTTLE! "00:00:01!"
	SPIDER-MAN can't break the grip of the WALDOS, but he can
	pull with super-human strength. He yanks OCK up through
	the STONE floor. OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL
	ROOM. ONE WALDO grabs on. The other one throws the RED
	POWER THROTTLE!

				OCK
		Spider-Man. You're end is coming. Life
		in its present form is ending... new
		dimensions, new horizons...

	The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to
	a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a
	rushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room
	towards the POINT of LIGHT.

				LIZ
			(bracing against the storm)
		What is happening?

				SPIDER-MAN
			(similarly braced)
		I don't know!!!

	LIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles
	against it.

				LIZ
		I can't... hold on!

	SPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Hold tight, Liz, hold tight!

	OCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room.
	He moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT.

				OCK
			(spaced out)
		You cut my power... there's too little
		power... It's so tiny... so tiny...
		there's only space... for me. But I've
		done it, Spider-Man. I have broken
		through... I've broken through!

				LIZ
		Don't do it, Dr. Octavius!

				OCK
		Okey... dokey... Now that's what I call
		an experiment!!!

	As he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it.
	He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the
	room with BLINDING LIGHT.

	SPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light
	diminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for
	the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet
	above the city!

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	Against the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of
	HELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE
	CRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER
	begins to drop in PULSING SURGES.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN is at the CONSOLE pulling and putting back
	WIRES. LIZ, fascinated, looks in at the WINDOW where OCK
	disappeared.

				SPIDER-MAN
		I can't control her. She's dropping too
		fast! Alright... let's go!

				LIZ
		But what about Peter? We've got to find
		Peter!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Peter will be okay, I promise you...
		Let's go before it's too late.
			(he grabs her)

				LIZ
		Go where?

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the
	cavalry.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	Trying to leave it, LIZ and SPIDEY are confronted with a
	nightmare. The room is tilted at a 45% angle. PIPES are
	bursting. SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles. Debris
	rains down. They come face to face with a diagonal maze
	of PIPES.

				SPIDER-MAN
		Maybe there's another way...

	A HUGE CRACK opens above them.

				LIZ
		It's breaking apart!

				SPIDER-MAN
		Alright, keep moving, a step at a time!

	They scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side,
	half the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000
	feet below.

				LIZ
		We have to go back.

				SPIDER-MAN
		We can't go back.

	He looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal
	wall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between
	themselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ.

				LIZ
		Forget it...

				SPIDER-MAN
		Okay, have it your way.

	He swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then
	he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze.
	LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN,
	furious.

				LIZ
			(shouting across)
		What am I supposed to do with this!

				SPIDER-MAN
			(shouting back)
		Go ahead. It's easier than it looks!
		We've got to try the fire escape.

	LIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on
	the LEDGE. She does a comic "phew" and the LEDGE buckles
	beneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the
	door, but it's stuck.

				LIZ
		The door is stuck.

	SPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his
	strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR
	open.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	They burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building.
	New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by
	their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the
	falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS
	look across at each other, helpless.

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It drops like a stone.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding
	along the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL.
	SPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then
	disappears over the edge. LIZ screams!

	LIZ fights to her feet and grabs onto the WEB STAND. She
	pulls on it with all her strength. She pulls and pulls
	and pulls. We see the WEB running up between the ROCKS.
	She gives one last pull and comes up with an EMPTY WEB
	END.

	A long, long beat.

				PETER (V.O.)
		Liz, Up here!

	LIZ looks up and sees PETER hanging out the WINDOW two
	stories above her. He throws out a ROPE LADDER. LIZ
	grabs it. She begins to climb.

	INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

	PETER pulls LIZ through the WINDOW. There is no time for
	an embrace.

				PETER
		Come on. I've found a way down.

				LIZ
			(at long last, love)
		I knew you were going to say that.

	They run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled
	beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit.

	INT. LARGE PHYSICS LAB - NIGHT

	This is the LAB we saw in the opening sequence. PETER has
	turned on the lights. He's got a handful of ROPE.

				LIZ
		Where's the way out?

				PETER
		Right there!

	We are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG.

				PETER
		Come on, help me with this.

	EXT. THE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

	LIZ is already down the ROPE LADDER and is holding it for
	PETER. He comes down with a HUGE bundle of RED, WHITE &
	BLUE.

				PETER
		Okay, stand still.

	He ties some ROPE around her waist.

				LIZ
		Is this going to work?

				PETER
		How do I know?

				LIZ
		I just adore confidence in a man.

				PETER
		Come on...

	They move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL
	PARK is still a couple thousand feet down.

				LIZ
		What is it you say when you jump?

				PETER
		Your prayers.

	They SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them
	to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They
	reach out for each other but their hands don't quite
	reach.

	Slowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks
	between them.

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And
	then it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of
	debris shoots upward.

	EXT. THE SKY - NIGHT

	There is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down
	into the frame lit by its wonderful light.

	The AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute.
	They hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below.
	They begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The
	wind billows LIZ'S skirt and plays with PETER'S hair, and
	snaps in the AMERICAN FLAG.

				LIZ
		We have a lot to thank your friend
		Spider-Man for.

				PETER
		Somehow, I don't think we've seen the
		last of him.

				LIZ
		Peter...! Finders, keepers...

				PETER
		What...? What is it? Why do you look
		like that?

				LIZ
		I think I'm in love.

				PETER
			(even his eyes blush)
		You are...

				LIZ
		With your friend...

				PETER
		Spider-Man? You're in love with
		Spider-Man?

				LIZ
		I am... you think we'll see him again?

				PETER
		We might... you never know.
		He kisses her.

				LIZ
		Oh.
			(bittersweet)
		This may be the end of a beautiful
		friendship you know?

				PETER
		Nah.

	They land in the center of the park under the parachute.
	They stay there and kiss... completely covered by the
	flag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.

	THE END
